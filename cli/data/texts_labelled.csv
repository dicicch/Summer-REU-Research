0,2,"Il lancio globale del 5G è ben avviato, e presto potremmo vedere nuove piccole torri cellulari vicino a tutte le scuole, su ogni strada residenziale, sparse in tutto l'ambiente naturale, e praticamente ovunque. Ma la sicurezza di questa tecnologia è in seria questione, e c'è una battaglia accanita per fermare l'implementazione del 5G finanziata dai contribuenti. La nuova rete cellulare utilizza onde millimetriche a radiofrequenza ad alta banda per fornire dati ad alta larghezza di banda a qualsiasi dispositivo in linea di vista.Tra le varie potenziali problematiche dell'esposizione alle onde radio 5G vi sono problemi con la pelle, che è interessante se si considera che questa tecnologia è già in uso in ambito militare per il controllo della folla.Questa tecnologia sta diventando onnipresente nelle principali forze armate mondiali, dimostrando quanto questa energia a radiofrequenza possa essere realmente efficace nel causare danni agli esseri umani e a qualsiasi altra cosa.La lotta per il 5G si sta intensificando a livello comunitario e la consapevolezza di questa importante questione si sta diffondendo rapidamente. Per ulteriori informazioni sul 5G, guarda questo video di Take Back Your Power, con Tom Wheeler, ex presidente della FCC e lobbista aziendale, che pronuncia un discorso piuttosto intimidatorio e presuntuoso lodando questa nuova tecnologia. Pero', la lotta per il 5G si sta riscaldando a livello comunitario, ed e' ora il momento di esprimersi contro di esso."
2,2,"What A Way To Go: Life at the End of Empire (2007)

A middle class white guy comes to grips with Peak Oil, Climate Change, Mass Extinction, Population Overshoot and the demise of the American Lifestyle.

Featuring interviews with Daniel Quinn, Derrick Jensen, Jerry Mander, Chellis Glendinning, Richard Heinberg, Thomas Berry, William Catton, Ran Prieur and Richard Manning. Produced by Sally Erickson. Written, Directed, and Edited by Tim Bennett.

“Hundreds of my readers have told me that my novel Ishmael should be read in every high school classroom in the world. Naturally I’d be delighted to see this happen, but I really think it would be more to the point to have What a Way to Go: Life at the End of Empire seen in every high school classroom in the world! The two hours of this documentary are two hours that bring hope for the future of humanity by awakening and informing in the most profound yet lucid way imaginable.”

Contrary to popular lore, independent filmmakers are rarely affluent. Most, in fact, go into deep debt making a film and only occasionally get back out of debt. We made What A Way To Go through local fundraising, investing our own capital, and thousands of hours of sweat equity. We are not in debt and feel very grateful.

We’ve decided to release the movie for free Internet viewing with the intention of being of service. However, we have never made even minimum wage for the thousands of hours we put into the making of the movie.

• gli altri, con le loro differenze, offrono visioni e idee diverse che hanno il potenziale di scuotere le fragili fondamenta dell'esoscheletro (vedi i capitoli successivi) costruito su autorità esterne e quindi condizionato da fattori esterni. Da questo punto di vista gli altri sono minacce esistenziali, mettendo a repentaglio l'identità stessa dell'individuo.
• gli altri, nella loro diversità, hanno il potenziale per avere opinioni diverse e quindi dire ""no"", che, in senso molto reale, significa sofferenza per gli individui narcisisti il cui ambiente permissivo gli ha insegnato a paragonare la convalida dei suoi capricci come piacere e il disaccordo con loro come sofferenza.
• Convenzionalismo - un alto grado di aderenza alle tradizioni e alle norme sociali che sono percepite come sottoscritte dalla società e dalle sue autorità consolidate, e la convinzione che anche gli altri nella propria società dovrebbero essere tenuti ad aderire a queste norme..

Alcuni di voi forse ricorderanno il mio ultimo articolo, "" post-imperialismo, un modello per un nuovo ordine sociale "", dove ho descritto una società utopica. Parlava delle idee di comunità, dei valori, della ricerca della verità e della realtà oggettiva. Il presente articolo fa quasi il contrario, descrive lo stato attuale della nostra società e dove probabilmente si sta dirigendo. Più specificamente, mi concentrerò, siano esse omosessuali, atee, composte da migranti, pagani, appassionati di arte moderna, vegetariani, sostenitori LGBT, e così via.L'elenco è lungo e si allunga sempre di più, come se fossimo entrati in un'epoca in corsa alla vittimizzazione. La maggior parte di queste minoranze si considerano """" o. Cercherò di spiegare come i SJWs hanno finito per imporre la loro visione del mondo alla maggioranza e da dove proviene questo infuriante proselitismo mostrato dai SJWs.Sono stati usati molti termini per descrivere il mondo distopico in cui ci troviamo: materialista, scientista, ateista, individualista, razionalista, consumista. Sono tutte descrizioni valide, anche se riguardano solo una delle tante sfaccettature della nostra società globale.Recentemente alcuni pensatori hanno tentato di dare una valutazione più ampia della nostra società e l'hanno descritta come nichilista, relativista, post-moderna. Questi tre termini hanno in comune il fatto diMa quando si osserva il proselitismo veemente mostrato dalle minoranze 'attiviste', sembra che esse credano fermamente nella verità e sono molto disposte a combattere per difenderla. Come può avvenire questo in una società nichilista/relativista/postmoderna, dove non c'è verità, un futuro e un obiettivo?Oltre a tracciare le cause e le origini fondamentali del fervore e del proselitismo delle minoranze ""dominanti"", cercherò di descrivere le dinamiche attuali e dimostrare che vanno ben oltre il ""nichilismo"". Ecco perché uso il termineNegli articoli precedenti ho descritto come le basi della nostra società siano state sistematicamente indebolite: bellezza e arte genere e identità , nazioni, famiglia religioni ... In tutti questi campi vediamo lo stesso processo al lavoro.Tutto inizia con le preoccupazioni di una minoranza: omosessuali, atei, migranti, pagani, appassionati d'arte moderna... e, la maggior parte delle volte,: sì, gli eretici sono stati perseguitati, le donne sono state oppresse, l'arte non classica è stata proibita, gli omosessuali sono stati perseguitati, le madri single sono state ostracizzate.Poi, gli abusi del passato che la minoranza ha subito vengono ampiamente pubblicizzati e spesso esagerati dai media, dagli accademici e nei programmi educativi. Il seguente sondaggio illustra perfettamente questo punto. L'istituto IPSOS Mori ha testato 27.000 soggetti in tutto il mondo. La domanda era: qual è la percentuale di persone che ritengono personalmente che l'omosessualità sia moralmente inaccettabile?I risultati hanno mostrato che le persone hanno. Ad esempio, nei Paesi Bassi il livello effettivo di intolleranza è molto basso: il 5%, tuttavia si stimava che fosse del 36%.Cosa significa questo? In primo luogo, l'omofobia sembra appartenere in gran parte al passato. In secondo luogo, la discrepanza del 31% è il risultato diretto di un'omofobia gonfia ed illusoria veicolata dai media e dai movimenti LGBT. In terzo luogo, e soprattutto, il seme della colpa è stato piantato con successo nella mente del pubblico. Come nella fiaba ""Jack e il Fagiolo Magico"", questo seme crescerà tremendamente, ma a differenza del felice esito della fiaba del XVIII secolo, non condurrà alla scoperta di grandi ricchezze, molto probabilmente succederà il contrario.Questa oppressione. È interessante notare che l'indagine di cui sopra mostra che la maggior parte dei paesi LGBT tolleranti mostra la maggiore discrepanza. Questa correlazione suggerisce che è proprio l'oppressione percepita a consentire l'attuazione di misure per ""proteggere"" la minoranza oppressa.Quando lo status di vittima è saldamente radicato nella mente delle persone, la società è pronta per, che si tratti del matrimonio gay per gli omosessuali oppressi, del laicismo per gli atei oppressi, dei musei d'arte moderna per gli appassionati di arte moderna oppressi, dei ristoranti senza carne per i vegetariani oppressi, ecc.Finora è tutto giusto e leale, ma ecco il punto; una volta raggiunta l'uguaglianza, le rivendicazioni della minoranza non si fermano. L'uguaglianza non è ovviamente un fine, ma piuttosto un passo conveniente politicamente corretto. Le rivendicazioni delle minoranze continuano perché le sfere influenti (sistemi accademici, media, sistema educativo) continuano a gonfiare eccessivamente l'oppressione percepita, ma c'è anche un fattore più profondo e più oscuro.Il ""guerriero dell'eguaglianza sociale"" (SJW o Social Justice Warrior) combina due termini che si escludono a vicenda: ""guerra"" e ""giustizia"". La guerra è la giustizia del vincitore , non la giustizia. Il ruolo fondamentale della giustizia è quello di intervenire come terzo tra due parti coinvolte (l'oppressore e gli oppressi).Quelle righe sono state scritte più di 2.000 anni fa e sono tuttora valide, fino a poco tempo fa. Questo è lo scopo stesso del, che è il fondamento della civiltà occidentale.Si noti che, sebbene lo Stato di diritto sia un principio molto interessante, la sua applicazione è diventata sempre più arbitraria, come dimostrano le numerose violazioni non sanzionate del diritto internazionale e i doppi standard spesso mostrati dai tribunali (sia che siate parte delle élite che delle masse).In ogni caso, senza un'adeguata giustizia, senza lo Stato di diritto, torniamo all'epoca dei feudi e delle vendette, quando il mondo era dominato da un'inestinguibile sete di vendetta e dove prevaleva la legge del più forte. Era l'epoca delle guerre punitive senza fine, la legge di Talion.Uno dei primi modelli per questa ""dinamica di inversione dello status di vittima"" è stato creato da alcuni leader della comunità ebraica (non dalla comunità ebraica nel suo complesso). Divenne un'operazione di vittimizzazione di grande successo, tanto che, anche se laico:Alla fine l'olocausto santificato viene usato per giustificare l'oppressione perpetrata da Israele. Notate però lo scorrimento. Se sei contro il sionismo o Israele sei etichettato come antisemita. Allo stesso modo, quando si critica il proselitismo delle organizzazioni filo-LGBT, vieni chiamato omofoba, o quando vengono criticate le migrazioni di massa sponsorizzate da Soros in una cultura straniera, sei razzista.Ma. Per conciliare questa differenza fondamentale, è necessaria una fusione abusiva (antisionismo = antisemitismo, anti LGBT = omofobia, anti-migrazione di massa = razzismo). Notare anche lo scorrimento temporale. Chi di noi c'era ai tempi dei campi di concentramento, delle campagne omofobe, delle stragi del KKK? Se non eravamo ancora nati,Affinché questa responsabilità ingiustificata prenda forma, è necessaria un'ulteriore fusione grossolana:. Negli anni '40 alcuni bianchi perseguitarono delle minoranze e, poiché siete in qualche modo legati ad essi (tramite etnia, nazionalità, sesso), siete quindi colpevoli. Il difetto logico del ragionamento di cui sopra, è ovvio, ma quando le emozioni sono abbastanza elevate (soprattutto il senso di colpa e la vergogna), la logica diventa irrilevante.Questo processo non è nuovo, facciamo un intermezzo di poesia e leggiamo questa bellissima poema, pubblicata per la prima volta nel 1668:Quanto sopra è stato scritto quasi quattro secoli fa. Da allora certe cose non sono cambiate poi di molto. Il lupo invocava la giustizia per un'immaginaria oppressione subita in passato, ma. Allo stesso modo, oggi l'uguaglianza o la giustizia non sono i veri obiettivi, ma pretesti.Ma se non si trattava mai veramente di postmodernismo o nichilismo, perché c'è stato un tale trambusto nell'ambiente intellettuale intorno a quei movimenti ""filosofici""? La risposta è semplice:. La cultura è profondamente radicata nelle menti delle persone, anche solo perché è un ambito conosciuto, e perché le persone sono legate alla famiglia, alla religione, alla dualità sessuale, all'arte e così via.Immaginate qualcuno che un secolo fosse andato in giro a sostenere che gli omosessuali dovevano avere il diritto di adottare bambini, che le religioni dovevano essere abolite, che le famiglie significano oppressione, che sono arte degli escrementi umani imbarattolati (ed il barattolo costa pure tanto)... tale persona sarebbe stata rinchiusa in manicomio.Gli ingegneri sociali hanno dovuto procedere gradualmente. Un primo passo è stato quello di: la religione equivale all'ateismo, l'eterosessualità equivale all'omosessualità, la femmina equivale al maschio, i genitori che hanno un figlio sono equivalenti ad un individuo che compra un bambino, ecc.Dopo che è stata raggiunta l'uguaglianza per le minoranze, sono emersi i privilegi: sovra-rappresentazione delle minoranze in posizioni di potere (media, politica), copertura mediatica palesemente positiva delle minoranze, leggi minoritarie , proselitismo aperto, segregazione ""positiva"" discriminazione inversa , insieme a una denigrazione senza fine e all'indebolimento dei valori ""tradizionali"".A questo ritmo, sarà presto illegale possedere un'opera d'arte vera e propria, le persone verranno arrestate per essere eterosessuali, sarà un'eresia considerare che il pianeta è rotondo, le persone saranno imprigionate per razzismo perché sostengono il loro paese, i prodotti a base di carne saranno scarsi e pesantemente tassati, il tabacco sarà vietato, e naturalmente la pedofilia sarà il clamore di domani, come l'omosessualità è il clamore di oggi.Quindi, come possiamo spiegare l'emergere improvviso e colossale degli SJW e di quelle minoranze che agiscono con un'aria di proselitismo, presunzione, aggressività e persino rabbia? Quali mutamenti nel nostro mondo e nelle nostre menti possono spiegare questo. Fu improvvisamente "" vietato proibire "" (lo slogan della rivolta del maggio 1968 in Francia). Si credeva ingenuamente che questa fosse la via della libertà.Ma la libertà, al contrario. Senza regole, senza confini, sembra che, più spesso che no, la gente regredisca allo stato infantile che si trova appena sotto la superficie di ogni adulto, dove è schiavo dei suoi impulsi più primitivi, mentre, a livello collettivo, la società regredisce alla barbarie, dove i più deboli diventano schiavi dei più forti.La generazione Y sono la prima generazione ad essere cresciuta dai genitori nati dopo la ""rivoluzione sessuale"". Questi genitori abbracciarono la cultura hippy e dissero ""sì"" a tutto ciò che i loro figli chiedevano. Lo hanno fatto a causa dell'ambiente permissivo prevalente, ma anche per motivi narcisistici:, l'immagine narcisistica dei genitori contava più della salute mentale dei loro figli.Quando il bambino diabetico chiedeva la caramella, i genitori dicevano di ""sì"" perché il bambino li amasse, cosa che era più importante dell'impatto negativo sulla salute del bambino. E' ormai scaduto da tempo il vecchio detto: ""Se i vostri figli non vi dicono che vi odiano almeno una volta al giorno, non state facendo il vostro lavoro come genitori"".C'è anche un fattore finanziario che spiega la deriva narcisistica vista tra i figli della generazione hippy (generazione Y). La maggior parte delle persone che hanno abbracciato la cultura 'hippy' erano abbastanza ricche, e non hanno dovuto trascorrere 8 ore al giorno in una fabbrica per pagare le bollette. Questa relativa ricchezza materiale ha permesso loro diNelle famiglie tradizionali, la madre nutre e il padre pone dei confini. Ma ora viviamo in una società senza patria. Negli Stati Uniti,. In oltre l'80% dei casi , il genitore monoparentale è la madre. Hai letto bene,Per illustrare l'influenza dell'educazione sulle propensioni ad abbracciare visioni autoritarie, ecco un estratto di un articolo intitolato ' Chi diventa nazista ', scritto nel 1941 da uno dei giornalisti più acclamati dell'epoca:Anche per quei pochi figli allevati dalla madre e dal padre, oggi quest'ultimo svolge raramente il ruolo della figura tradizionale dell'autorità. In molte famiglie in tutto l'Occidente, la fonte della legittimità di un padre - la capacità di mantenere la famiglia attraverso il lavoro - è stata distrutta dall' aumento dei tassi di disoccupazione In passato, se i genitori non riuscivano a stabilire limiti per i loro figli, altre interazioni sociali con coetanei, membri della comunità e vicini di casa potevano, almeno in parte, compensare per la compiacenza dei genitori. Ma, per la generazione Y, Internet ha in gran parte sostituito le interazioni sociali reali e le loro nozioni di responsabilità, coerenza e onestà.Nell'era di Internet, è possibile fare il narcisista quanto ti pare, e se un altro utente ti fa notare i tuoi errori, basta spostarsi in un'altra chatroom o forum dove gli utenti condividono le tue stesse convinzioni (spesso errate).Non sorprende che oggi la maggior parte dei punti caldi della giustizia sociale siano le università, un luogo in cui i gruppi sociali più poveri sono raramente rappresentati. Questa generazione - potremmo definirla la ""generazione persa"". Queste sono le persone che daranno forma alla nostra società futura; sono i leader di domani.Questa generazione rifiuta la diversità. Laè il loro nemico a causa di due fattori:Ora, come conciliare il rifiuto della diversità con le numerose rivendicazioni dei SJWs sulla diversità e il multiculturalismo? Bene, al di là di queste parole accattivanti, cosa dimostrano i fatti? La richiesta di ""Diversità"" da parte dei SJWs riguarda la diversità di superficialità: apparenze, orientamento sessuale, pronomi... mentre essi sostengono la eliminazione delle differenze biologiche (sesso, razza, handicap) e delle differenze culturali (valori morali, religioni, ecc.).Un altro paradosso è che, mentre i SJW chiedono la diversità, la tolleranza e l'eguaglianza, i SJWs sembrano intolleranti. Sei libero di avere qualsiasi genere tu voglia, e tanti piercing quanti vuoi, ma non puoi pensare in modo diverso, molto meno opporsi all'ideologia SJW.Nel mondo SJWL'ideologia dei SJW(dove tutti gli individui sono diversi ma hanno gli stessi diritti), ma, perché percepiscono la diversità come la radice dell'oppressione. Pertanto, per porre fine all'oppressione e ripristinare l'eguaglianza/giustizia, le differenze devono essere abolite.Se, come un individuo 'normale', si vuole essere pienamente riconosciuti come un cittadino del 'Nuovo Mondo' dei SJW, è necessario prima di tutto implementare alcuni importanti 'miglioramenti': eseguire una chirurgia per il cambiamento del sesso, tagliarti una delle gambe, dipingere i capelli viola, coprire il corpo con tatuaggi, e strofinarti il sedere con un crocifisso Poiché le emozioni sono diventate più forti della ragione e l'interesse personale ha sopraffatto l'interesse comune, le minoranze di oggi vivono in una negazione permanente della realtà (l'esistenza della verità, della realtà oggettiva, della dualità uomo/donna), che hanno sostituito con la loro assunzione soggettiva.In questo senso. Mi viene in mente questo dialogo sorprendente:Il narcisismo dilagante che vediamo oggi intorno a noi ha portato ad una concentrazione ristretta su sé stessi a spese degli altri e delle comunità in cui viviamo.Infatti, prima dell'""era moderna"", gli individui vivevano in sistemi altamente integrati. Essi facevano parte della natura (vedi animismo), dell'umanità (trattare gli altri come fratelli), della creazione (figlio di Dio), dell'ordinamento giuridico (cittadino), di un sistema trascendente (Dio, cielo, terra, inferno) e di un sistema morale (buono, cattivo). Gli individui avevano un profondo rispetto per il passato (culto degli antenati) e una forte preoccupazione per il futuro (lavorare sodo per dare un futuro migliore ai bambini).Tutti questi. Il sé è stato isolato, dissociato dal suo ambiente.La natura è negata. Per il teorico di genere, un essere umano nasce libero da qualsiasi predeterminazione naturale, compreso il suo sesso. L'umanità è demonizzata (l'altra è fonte di oppressione), le regole e le norme sono rifiutate come oppressive, la moralità è negata perché non c'è più bene comune poiché ogni evento è analizzato solo da un punto di vista egoistico e soggettivo.Questa implosione narcisistica ha anche portato ad una dissociazione tra sé stessi e il nostro corpo. Ricordate lo slogan del 1968 "" Il mio corpo appartiene a me "", cioè Posso fare quello che voglio con il mio corpo?In tempi passati, la Chiesa ha proposto una dualità anima/corpo in cui entrambi dovevano vivere in armonia. Oggi che è stato sostituito da una dualità di ego/corpo (un'idea portata avanti da Locke e Cartesio (vedi ad esempio l'ultima mania per il piercing, cicatrici, tatuaggi e anche la crescente importanza del transumanesimo).In passato la dualità uomo/donna era simboleggiata nella. Poi il piacere sessuale e la procreazione sono stati dissociati dalla contraccezione.In passato, la masturbazione era una primitiva alternativa sessuale per il ""sesso reale"". Oggi, il culto dell'ego e l'implosione narcisistica hanno portato ad un numero crescente di individui che affermano di preferire la masturbazione guardando porno piuttosto che il rapporto reale. Ciò ha dato origine all'ennesimo ""orientamento sessuale"": il pornosessuale . L'aumento vertiginoso delle vendite di giocattoli sessuali è un altro indicatore del fatto che l'attività sessuale diventa un ""passatempo"" di per sé.Un singolo ""genitore"" può comprare dei bambini attraverso la riproduzione in vitro, rendendo reale una delle fantasie narcisistiche più avanzate: l'auto-ingegnerizzazione. Presto, a pagamento, un ""genitore"" sarà in grado di modificare la genetica del bambino e personalizzarlo come un'auto. Il processo, chiamato germlining , è già utilizzato per esaminare geneticamente i feti umani per individuarne le ""malattie"".Con il. Oggi, gli anziani vengono dimenticati nelle case di cura mentre le persone vivono a credito, 'spendendo tutto oggi senza pensare ad un domani' per soddisfare i desideri transitori del momento presente.Sempre più giovani scelgono la chirurgia plastica per conformarsi ad alcuni ""ideali"" estetici, compromettendone l'aspetto futuro (64.000 pazienti di chirurgia estetica nel 2014 avevano 13-19 anni). Siamo entrati nei terribili tempi di incontri rapidi, obsolescenza programmata, fast food, consegne col drone, messaggistica istantanea, feed di notizie in tempo reale, imparare una lingua in un giorno, perdere 10 kg in una settimana, ecc.Senza passato e futuro, non c'è più speranza, non c'è più prospettiva storica, non si impara più dagli errori del passato, non c'è più pianificazione a lungo termine. Non ci sono più rimpianti, rimorsi o responsabilità, non ci sono più riconoscimenti di modelli storici. L'individuo cade nel vuoto insignificante dell'onnipresente attimo presente.Tuttavia, non tutti della generazione Y stanno sperimentando questa implosione narcisistica; non tutti sono degli accaniti SJW, e quindi il fattore generazionale non può essere l'unica causa dell'ascesa dei SJWs.Questo estratto fornisce una spiegazione interessante sulla questione di cui sopra:Il processo descritto sopra è molto simile a quello che il professore pensionato di Psicologia presso l'Università di Manitoba Bob Altemeyer ha studiato per decenni. Ha notato ripetutamente gli stessi risultati sorprendenti.Attraverso l'uso di questionari e tabelle, ha scoperto un sottogruppo che mostra costantemente un alto grado di aderenza alle tradizioni e alle norme sociali che sono percepite come approvate dalla società e dalle sue autorità istituite, e la convinzione che anche gli altri nella propria società dovrebbero essere tenuti ad aderire a queste norme.In particolare questo sottogruppo di soggetti ha ottenuto un punteggio costantemente alto per i tre punti seguenti:Altemeyer ha coniato il termine ""seguaci autoritari"" per gli individui che hanno ottenuto un punteggio elevato per le tre variabili di cui sopra.Si noti in particolare la terza variabile: l'aggressività autoritaria. I seguaci non solo seguono le autorità, ma sono anche i primi esecutori dell'ordine stabilito. Sono inclini a sottomettersi alle autorità, ma anche a mostrare aggressività nei confronti di coloro che si oppongono alle loro opinioni.. Si limitano a conformarsi e far rispettare l'ordine stabilito. Se l'ordine stabilito è giusto, saranno una forza per il bene; se l'ordine stabilito è sbagliato, saranno una forza per il male.Altemeyer ha scoperto le personalità autoritarie decenni fa e inizialmente li ha chiamati 'autoritari di destra' (RWA), probabilmente perché al momento l'autorità dominante era di destra e quindi è stata l'ideologia che ha fatto appello agli autoritari al momento. Più avanti, Altemeyer scoprì che c'erano anche Autoritari di sinistra (LWA).. Ieri è stato il conservatorismo di destra, oggi è il liberalismo di sinistra.Poiché ciò che conta per gli autoritari non è tanto la sostanza dell'ideologia (le idee e i valori che difende), quanto il suo predominio e la sua legittimità, essi possono abbracciare con la stessa facilità la maggioranza oppressiva di ieri come abbracciano la minoranza oppressiva di oggi. Potreste trovare la stessa personalità autoritaria che perseguitava gli omosessuali negli anni Ottanta (quando l'omofobia era più diffusa) che perseguiterà gli eterosessuali domani, perché è la nuova dottrina dominante.Gli autoritariCiò spiega probabilmente perché, intorno agli anni '90, Altemeyer abbia iniziato a notare un calo della percentuale di RWA rispetto al numero totale di soggetti. Egli spiega questa tendenza inaspettata dal fatto che stava diventando famoso nel campus e gli studenti stavano cercando di nascondere il loro atteggiamento autoritario durante la compilazione dei questionari. Un'altra spiegazione è che negli anni '90 l'ideologia dominante si stava spostando verso la sinistra liberale, per cui la popolazione degli RWA si stava riducendo mentre quella degli LWA stava crescendo.Altemeyer ha dedicato molto tempo ed energia alla comprensione di ciò che rende una persona autoritaria. Mentre ha scoperto diversi fattori causali come l'educazione, la genetica, il livello di istruzione ed il fatto di avere figli, non è mai riuscito a individuare la ragione principale.Nel tentativo di capire la causa di questa differenza fondamentale, Andrew Bard Schmookler ha proposto l'idea di endoscheletro morale vs esoscheletro morale.Quanto sopra è particolarmente interessante se lo colleghiamo all'origine stessa del proselitismo minoritario odierno, in particolare della difesa delle minoranze LGBT. La teoria di genere deriva direttamente dal. L'idea di base è che, se non c'è più differenza di sesso (maschio/femmina), non ci può essere più disuguaglianza di genere.Due pionieri di questa ideologia sono stati Jean Paul Sartre e Simone de Beauvoir. Jean-Paul Sartre, padre dell'esistenzialismo, ha sviluppato la sua teoria dell' "" essere per gli altri "" sulla base di un'idea fondamentale:Non finisce qui, e Sartre aggiunge un tocco piuttosto negativo a questa idea quando afferma che ""gli ebrei esistono come tali solo per il modo in cui sono percepiti da persone antisemite"".De Beauvoir non ha sviluppato le sue idee femministe dal nulla; ha semplicemente applicato la teoria di Sartre sulle donne. Nel suo libro Secondo Sesso, afferma che ""Non si nasce donna, ma si diventa donna"", e spiega che la femminilità non è altro che una condizionedagli occhi maschili.Come tutte le menzogne convincenti, Sartre inizia con un granello di verità: gli altri hanno un'influenza sul modo in cui percepiamo noi stessi. Ma sarebbe una menzogna affermare che questo sia l'unico fattore.Sartre mente anche quando afferma che. Quante volte un fattore esterno - un buon padre, una buona madre, un amico, un insegnante, ecc. - ci ha influenzato positivamente? Per Sartre e De Beauvoir tali manifestazioni non si verificano mai. Attraverso una grossolana generalizzazione delle proprie proiezioni negative, hanno ritenuto oppressive tutte le influenze esterne.Questi due ""grandi pensatori"" del XX secolo hanno incoraggiato le persone a credere che, in nome della libertà (libertà di essere chiunque si voglia essere: un uomo, una donna, uno scoiattolo), si ha il diritto di negare qualsiasi verità immanente (la dualità uomo-donna, ad esempio), e di reputare gli altri come fonte di oppressione, imponendo loro un'identità che non gli appartiene. Se applichiamo questi due principi alla lettera, finiremo in una bolla totalmente narcisistica governata dalla paura, dall'odio e da menzogne eclatanti.Vedete il paradosso fondamentale al centro delle autorità esistenzialiste: si suppone che si debba respingere qualsiasi autorità esterna perché è fonte di oppressione,A questo punto, abbiamo stabilito una certa correlazione tra i seguaci autoritari e l'esoscheletro morale, i seguaci non autoritari e l'endoscheletro morale. La domanda logica successiva è: da dove è nato questo endoscheletro morale?C'è certamente una miriade di fattori che influenzano la nostra bussola morale (nutrizione, genetica, inquinamento, istruzione, background culturale, esperienze infantili, traumi, ecc). In questa sezione affronterò la seguente domanda: la nostra bussola morale potrebbe essere un'emanazione dell'anima, della coscienza?Siccome alcune persone sono autoritarie mentre altre no, questo significa che alcune persone hanno una qualità d'""anima"" diversa? Secondo diverse tradizioni orientali , le anime sperimentano l'incarnazione e seguono un processo evolutivo, per esempio incarnando negli animali precede l'incarnazione negli esseri umani. È un po' come l'evoluzione di Darwin della teoria delle specie applicata alle anime.Prendendo questa idea di anime ""giovani"" e ""vecchie"",Naturalmente, questa è solo speculazione, nessuno può dimostrare o smentire l'esistenza dell'anima. Tuttavia questa ipotesi getta una luce interessante su alcuni fenomeni che mi hanno perplesso per anni.Concentriamoci su quattro minoranze moderne: i flat-earthers, i vegetariani, i sostenitori della fluidità di genere (pro-LGBT) e gli atei.Come percepirebbe il mondo un individuo appena incarnato? Fresco dal regno animale, tenderebbe a vedere il mondo in 2 dimensioni (terra piatta), mentre qualcuno più abituato al regno umano percepirebbe il mondo naturalmente in 3 dimensioni (terra rotonda)?Un individuo incarnato di recente sarebbe riluttante a mangiare le creature che nelle sue ultime incarnazioni erano i suoi ""fratelli"" (vegetariani), mentre un individuo con più ""esperienza"" come un essere umano non vedrebbe alcun problema nel mangiare la carne degli animali?Un individuo incarnato di recente come un essere umano vedrebbe il genere come un concetto fluido e arbitrario, mentre una ""vecchia anima"" - che ha trascorso numerose incarnazioni umane come lo stesso genere - avrebbe sviluppato un forte orientamento di genere?È possibile che le giovani anime rifiutino l'idea di Dio e della vita dopo la morte perché, non abituate al processo di reincarnazione, credono che non ci sia vita dopo la morte, mentre le anime più vecchie - avendo ripetutamente sperimentato che il loro corpo è solo un veicolo temporaneo - hanno una innata ""consapevolezza"" che sopravvivranno alla morte inevitabile del corpo?Questa speculazione getta una luce molto diversa su quelle discussioni accese alle quali probabilmente avete assistito (o avuto!). Pensiamo ai flat-earthers che sono totalmente convinti che la terra sia piatta, ai vegetariani che religiosamente credono che mangiare carne sia un omicidio (cannibalismo?), agli individui che cambiano il loro orientamento sessuale con la stessa facilità con cui si cambiano le magliette e agli atei che sono così totalmente convinti che non ci sia vita dopo la morte.E se fosse così che percepiscono la realtà? E se questo fosse un vero riflesso della loro condizione di ""anima giovane""?Ma non siamo ""tutti nati uguali""? Sì, in un certo senso, ma forse non sotto alcuni aspetti fondamentali.A questo punto, comprendiamo meglio come i fattori di alimentazione (millenari coccolati) e fattori naturali (endoscheletro morale) hanno portato ad una situazione in cui un'intera generazione è matura per essere manipolata in una frenesia narcisistica mirata a obiettivi molto sbagliati.Gli psicopatici al potere odiano ciò che ci rende umani, odiano l'amore genuino, il senso di appartenenza, la bellezza, la spiritualità, la trascendenza... perché non possono accedere a quelle sfere superiori. Quindi forse non ""odiano"" questi aspetti, ma sono completamente indifferenti a loro, il che probabilmente significherebbe la stessa cosa.Gli psicopatici in posizioni di potere tentano di imporci una visione anti-morale del mondo, dove odio, violenza, omicidio e menzogna sono i nuovi valori ""positivi"". Per farlo si affidano fortemente a mezzi di comunicazione controllati che elogiano questa visione oscura del mondo insieme a scienziati ed esperti che supportano questo paradigma con false ricerche.Ma l'influenza dei media e degli ""esperti"" non è sufficiente a far accettare l'inaccettabile dal punto di vista morale. Così l'élite psicopatica si affida anche alla parte narcisistica e/o autoritaria della popolazione per sostenere e far valere le proprie opinioni.Secondo Altemeyer i tre tratti psicologici più diffusi tra gli autoritari sono. Per inciso, l'intera campagna di manipolazione condotta dall'élite attraverso i SJW si basa proprio su questi principi:Questo processo di ponerizzazione non è cresciuto linearmente, ma ha attraversato diversi altipiani e improvvise raffiche. Nel corso degli anni '90, i concetti postmoderni/nichilistici che circolavano da anni negli ambienti accademici sono stati ampiamente diffusi in tutti i settori della società.Oltre al mondo accademico, gli psicopatici si sono infiltrati in altri settori chiave della nostra società (media, giustizia, politica), e lentamente li hanno infusi con la loro visione contorta del mondo.Questo è ciò a cui assistiamo oggi:Si noti che questa. Questi ultimi finiscono per gettare via il proverbiale bambino con l'acqua sporca e oggi assistiamo a antisionisti che negano la realtà dell'olocausto, anti-LGBT che negano che l'omofobia sia sempre stata un problema reale, antifemministi che sostengono che le donne non sono mai state oppresse, eccetera. Quando i due campi sono altamente isterizzati e hanno opinioni così estreme, soggettive e antagoniste , il pianeta è maturo per conflitti di proporzioni enormi.Con il sostegno degli autoritari isterizzati, gli psicopatici al potere tentano di farci normalizzare la devianza e accettare l'inaccettabile. La pedofilia, naturalmente, fa parte degli obiettivi. Ed è stato così per lungo tempo. Pensateci: le differenze tangibili tra un uomo e una donna sono più grandi delle differenze tangibili tra un 14enne e un 18enne.Se riescono a lavare il cervello alle masse al punto da fargli credere che la dualità maschio/femmina sia solo un costrutto sociale, immaginate quanto sarà facile offuscare il confine tra un 18enne e un 14enne e, successivamente, adottare una legge che riduca l'età del consenso, ovvero legalizzare la pedofilia.(ognuno ha il diritto di esprimere la propria sessualità, anche verso i bambini), dell'(che è più forte di ogni altra cosa, comprese le barriere artificiali di età) e della(libertà sessuale).La normalizzazione della pedofilia è già in corso con le stesse tattiche sopra descritte (vittimizzazione di una minoranza). E non è un oscuro sito filo-pedofilo che sostiene questo punto di vista, ma il covo molto rispettabile e, per inciso, istituzionale di pedofili, noto anche come la BBC Tali opinioni, sostenute e promosse dai media dell'establishment, sono state coltivate e promosse per decenni da ""pensatori"" schizoidi e psicopatici.La coppia di Sartre e De Beauvoir, insieme a Derida, Foucault e Deleuze, hanno creato la cosiddetta teoria francese , che ha stabilito le basi del postmodernismo. Sì, la Francia ha portato il formaggio puzzolente nel mondo, e una teoria che è ancora più fetida.Sono tentato di suggerire la seguente possibile sequenza di eventi:Naturalmente, si tratta solo di speculazione. Certo, se i fondatori della ""filosofia"" esistenzialista/postmodernista avessero apertamente sostenuto la pedofilia, sarebbe un caso più convincente, ma questi individui così intelligenti e onorati non farebbero mai una cosa del genere, giusto?SBAGLIATO. Ognuno dei cinque ""pensatori"" occidentali di spicco del XX secolo hanno assunto posizioni ufficiali a difesa della pedofilia . Nel 1971 hanno firmato un manifesto per protestare contro la condanna di 3 uomini che hanno abusato di bambini di appena 13 anni.Ma forse la loro promozione della pedofilia era solo un'aberrazione, o presa fuori contesto? Per niente. Sei anni dopo il loro primo manifesto , nel 1977, hanno firmato un manifesto per abbassare l'età del consenso a 13 anni.Sartre e De Beauvoir non si sono limitati alle parole, ma sono passati anche ai fatti. Sartre disse notoriamente : ""L'inferno è l'altra gente"". Dubito che ""l'inferno sia l'altra gente"", ma sono abbastanza sicuro che Sartre e De Beauvoir siano stati l'inferno per altre persone, soprattutto alcuni ragazzini.A questo punto capiamo meglio come sotto le spoglie della correttezza politica ( eguaglianza, giustizia, libertà ) gli psicopatici al potere isterizzino le masse in generale, i seguaci autoritari in particolare, per promuovere i loro piani nefasti, compresa la normalizzazione della pedofilia.Per isterizzare meglio le masse, gli psicopatici usano vari strumenti: l'inganno, la menzogna, la paura e l'auto-giustizia, come descritto sopra. Il loro pio desiderio e ed il loro egocentrismo non hanno limiti, stanno giocando ad un gioco molto pericoloso che sembra aver aperto inavvertitamente un vaso di Pandora.Gli archetipi sono potenti principi universali che possono manifestarsi nella cultura e nel comportamento umano.Mentre analizzava il movimento dei SJWs, Jordan Peterson , professore di psicologia all'Università di Toronto, ha suggerito che un meccanismo dietro l'intera dinamica eraL'eroe è colui che affronta la sofferenza sistemica. Lui è colui che affronta e uccide il drago che rende tutti miserabili.Non c'è niente di sbagliato negli eroi. Al contrario, ci ispirano, trascendono, forniscono modelli di ruolo, ci insegnano coraggio e sacrificio e ci liberano dall'oppressione dei draghi.. Ed è esattamente quello che sta succedendo in questo momento. Oggi assistiamo a orde di guerrieri della giustizia sociale, per la maggior parte donne, in una crociata contro l'ingiustizia e la sofferenza. Non c'è nulla di necessariamente sbagliato in questo, ma l'élite ha abilmente: l'uomo bianco, la chiesa, gli eterosessuali, i tradizionalisti e i patrioti.L'archetipo femminile è molto potente. E' profondamente collegato nel sistema vivente ed è uno dei motivi per cui siamo ancora in vita. Si tratta di un principio fondamentalmente altruistico in cui, di fronte ad una grave minaccia,, cioè la perpetuazione della specie è più importante per il sistema vivente che la conservazione di un individuo.Come gli animali, l'essere umano ha questo istinto profondamente radicato. Quando una donna affronta una grave minaccia indirizzata verso qualcuno che ama più di se stessa, può entrare in una ""modalità"" molto particolare. Una manifestazione di questo ""modo"" è quella che la scienza moderna chiama "" forza isterica "". Probabilmente avete sentito le storie in cui una madre che vede il suo bambino intrappolato sotto un'auto riesce in qualche modo a sollevare l'auto e salvare il suo bambino. Vi sono tante storie simili. In una situazione del genere, la madre si concentra sul salvataggio del bambino e non sulla consapevolezza della sua impresa sovrumana, per cui purtroppo tali notizie sono sostenute solo da prove aneddotiche.Alcuni scienziati hanno cercato di spiegare la 'forza isterica' come un'esplosione di adrenalina, ma non credo che anche con una massiccia iniezione di adrenalina una donna possa sollevare un'auto. E' solo meccanicamente impossibile - i suoi muscoli (come quelli di un uomo) non possono esercitare fisicamente una forza così tremenda.Quindi, se è meccanicamente impossibile, allora un altro tipo di forza deve essere la fonte. Forse è quello che gli artisti marziali chiamano 'chi', un'energia permeante che un individuo può canalizzare dato il giusto stato d'animo, dove l'intento (salvare il mio bambino) e le emozioni (lo stimolo per salvare il bambino) diventano più forti di qualsiasi cosa, compresi i sistemi di convenzioni tradizionali , cioè la rappresentazione della realtà ('Non sono in grado di sollevare un'auto').Si noti come questo stato trascenda la razionalità, non si tratta più di fatti o realtà; si tratta di una massiccia ondata di intenti e di emozioni particolari.. Può essere usata per il bene: salvare un bambino da una minaccia reale, oppure può essere pervertita e usata per distruggere minacce immaginarie. Gli psicopatici al potere hanno isterizzato molte donne e molti uomini (l'archetipo femminile si applica anche agli uomini, ma probabilmente in modi più subdoli), hanno fabbricato ""draghi"" artificiali che minacciano i loro ""bambini"", e in questo momento quelle forze incontrollabili vengono scatenate davanti ai nostri occhi increduli.Una madre entrerà in questa ""modalità"" solo in caso di minaccia diretta di morte percepita per il suo bambino. Una minaccia minore non è sufficiente. Ecco perché il discorso delle minoranze che agiscono è così esagerato e focalizzato sulla sicurezza e sulle minacce: la necessità di 'spazi sicuri', le femministe che vedono stupratori ovunque, gli attivisti LGBT che vedono persone omofobe ovunque. Di conseguenza, coloro che non appartengono a un gruppo minoritario (e ci sono ancora parecchie persone) sono rappresentati come unache deve essere annientata prima che le minoranze vengano annientate.. il lato buono dell'archetipo maschile è la capacità di provvedere, la forza e la razionalità. E' grazie a questo archetipo che sono stati costruiti edifici, coltivati campi, protetti territori e comunità. Ma, anche esso può essere facilmente corrotto come l'archetipo femminile., dove gli uomini isterizzati scambiarono il ""provvedere"" con il ""saccheggio"", la ""forza"" con la ""barbarie"" e la ""razionalità"" con ""insensibilità"". I risultati sono stati devastanti. L'archetipo femminile è probabilmente ancora più potente ma, per quanto ne so, non è mai stato sovvertito su scala globale.Le nostre care élite dovrebbero davvero riflettere sul caso Dutroux , la rivelazione parziale di un ampio gruppo di pedofili in Belgio, che ha portato l'intero paeseche è stata infine domata da una copertura mediatica trasparente, quando infine è stato incolpato un predatore solitario.Il mio punto è che se qualcosa può scatenare quel feroce istinto protettivo materno, questa è la minaccia della normalizzazione della pedofilia e di tutto ciò che essa comporta. Così, mentre l'élite psicopatica isterizza i SJW e 'attiva' l'archetipo femminile contro la maggioranza silenziosa, dovrebbe essere molto prudente che nessuno veda le scarpe dei pedofili nascoste dietro le quinte, altrimenti le loro malvagie macchinazioni potrebbero ritorcersi contro in modo epico.In questo articolo abbiamo visto come le minoranze oppresse diventino minoranze oppressive, perché questa visione di divisione del mondo viene sostenuta da alcuni della generazione Y, in particolare da coloro che possono possedere tratti autoritari (probabilmente correlati all'ipotesi dell'esoscheletro morale/anima giovanile). Inoltre, abbiamo visto come questa generazione venga manipolata per imporre l'agenda distruttiva di un'élite psicopatica che gioca con una delle più pericolose forze, l'archetipo femminile.Anche se questa prospettiva sembra abbastanza drammatica, quando si pensa alle radici di tutte queste sciocchezze dei SJW, tutto si riduce a un problema abbastanza semplice: si tratta die di come affrontarle.Un modo per affrontare le differenze è percepirle come: tesi (un lato dell'argomento), antitesi (l'altro lato dell'argomento) e sintesi (che trascende l'apparente opposizione e ci avvicina alla verità). Questo è il principio della dialettica resa famosa da Socrate e Platone. I disaccordi si risolvono attraverso una discussione razionale e, in ultima analisi, attraversoLo stesso vale a livello collettivo. Tutte le grandi conquiste dell'umanità - cattedrali, medicina, esplorazione spaziale - sono il risultato di una proficua cooperazione tra individui con talenti complementari.L'altro modo di affrontare la diversità è attraverso l'opposizione e la divisione, che inevitabilmente porta a un mondo dominato dalla diffidenza, dall'odio, dai conflitti e dalle guerre. Un mondo dominato non dall'uguaglianza dei diritti, ma dall'identità: un esercito di cloni incubati nelle loro bolle narcisistiche.Quindi, c'è una soluzione? Come al solito, la conoscenza protegge. Molte persone ignorano ancora questa marea distruttiva che ha già iniziato a erodere le fondamenta della nostra società, quindi faremmo meglio a svegliarci e comprendere pienamente il vero orrore della situazione prima che sia troppo tardi.Tuttavia, se ci renderemo sufficientemente conto della situazione attuale, resterebbe una domanda: saremmo abbastanza saggi e misericordiosi da poter difenderci senza ricorrere alla medesima aggressione delle minoranze dominanti, fermando così il ciclo infinito della vendetta?"

According to Harvard School of Public Health researchers, the healthiest diets cost about $1.50 more per day than the least healthy diets.

However, healthy foods are often much less expensive than junk foods when compared with health costs of eating an unhealthy diet. The price difference is very small, the Harvard researchers found, in comparison to the economic costs of diet-related chronic diseases, which would be dramatically reduced by healthy diets.

Dr Michael Greger, founder of NutritionFacts.org and author of New York Times Best Seller How Not to Die, insists that healthy foods cost less than junk foods. While junk food may be four times cheaper than healthy foods, he says, you get 20 times less nutrition.

11,2,"Consumer Reports’ Recommends Sunscreens That Seep Poison Into Your Bloodstream

While there are instances where sunscreen may be prudent, these products are widely overused and contribute to widespread vitamin D deficiency. In my view, sunscreen is rarely needed, provided you’re following sensible sun exposure guidelines to prevent burning. Simply get out of the sun or wear clothing the moment your skin starts to turn light pink.

That said, conventional guidance by the American Academy of Dermatology1 stresses the use of sunscreen, not only when lying on the beach but every single day, regardless of weather or skin pigmentation. Aside from promoting vitamin D deficiency, which has a long list of health consequences, sunscreen use may also be a source of toxic exposure.

A pilot study2,3,4,5 by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) shows four commonly used active ingredients in sunscreen are absorbed into your blood at levels that could potentially pose health risks. The four active ingredients looked in this study were avobenzone, oxybenzone, octocrylene and ecamsule.

Twenty-four participants were asked to apply 2 milligrams (mg) of sunscreen per square centimeter over 75% of their body, using either one of two sprays, a lotion or a cream. This amount equates to the maximum recommended dose recommended by most makers of sunscreen.

A total of 30 blood samples were collected from each participant over seven days of application. The geometric mean maximum plasma concentrations were as follows for each of the chemicals:6
• Avobenzone — 4 nanograms per milliliter (ng/mL) for spray No.1; 3.4 ng/mL for spray No. 2; 4.3 ng/mL for lotion and 1.8 ng/mL for the cream
• Oxybenzone — 209.6 ng/mL for spray No. 1; 194.9 ng/mL for spray No. 2, and 169.3 ng/mL for lotion
• Octocrylene, — 2.9 ng/mL for spray No. 1; 7.8 ng/mL for spray No. 2; 5.7 ng/mL for lotion, and 5.7 ng/mL for cream

According to the authors:7

Continue Using Sunscreen, FDA Says, Ignoring Potential Health Risks of Oxybenzone

While it comes as no surprise that toxic chemicals are being absorbed into your blood when applied to your skin, what’s shocking is the FDA’s guidance in light of the results — continue using sunscreen!8

This, despite the fact that all four chemicals were found to enter the bloodstream at levels above the presumed “safe” level after a single day of application, and remained in the system for at least 24 hours after last use. Just what might the ramifications be if you’re using them every single day, year-round?

Research9 by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) published in 2008 found 96.8% of the 2,517 urine samples collected as part of the 2003-2004 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey had detectable levels of oxybenzone, which is a testament to just how much sunscreen people are using. And this data is 15 years old. It is likely far worse now.

Dr. David Strauss, director of the division of applied regulatory science at the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation Research and co-author of the FDA pilot study, told Time,10

Dermatologist and spokesman for the American Academy of Dermatology, Dr. David Leffell, echoed the FDA’s recommendation, telling CNN Health,11

According to the Environmental Working Group,12 oxybenzone

Research has also linked oxybenzone to “significantly lower” testosterone levels in adolescent boys,13 and reduced sperm count14 and altered hormone levels in men (specifically testosterone, estradiol and inhibin B).15 In women, the chemical has been linked to endometriosis,16 shorter pregnancies and lower male birth weights.17

Oxybenzone is also lethal to certain sea creatures, including horseshoe crab eggs, and researchers warn the widespread use of oxybenzone-containing sunscreens pose a serious threat to coral reefs and sea life.18

This effect is what prompted Hawaiian lawmakers to ban the sale of sunscreens containing oxybenzone and octinoxate, both of which have been linked to severe coral damage.19,20

As mentioned, 0.5 ng/mL is the threshold for systemic concentration via absorption set by the FDA, below which companies do not need to perform certain toxicology studies. Here’s how the FDA set that threshold:21

It’s worth noting that the 0.5 ng/mL threshold originates from regulation of chemicals that can migrate from food packaging into food, which means they would be consumed. Chemicals applied to your skin frequently go straight into your bloodstream, bypassing your gastrointestinal system, and hence may pose a different and potentially greater threat to health than ingested chemicals.

In short, there’s no telling whether the 0.5 ng/mL threshold is really appropriate for these four (and other) sunscreen chemicals. Only further study can shed light on that.

But rather than taking a precautionary approach and instructing individuals to use sunscreens known to be safe (non-nano-sized zinc oxide and titanium dioxide), the FDA simply says,

From my perspective, the results are a warning flag indicating you indeed should refrain from using these products as they have well documented health hazards!

Consumer Reports has issued equally irrational recommendations. Less than a week before publishing the results of the FDA’s pilot study,23 in which they noted that the “results strengthen FDA’s call for more information on sunscreen safety,” Consumer Reports issued its annual Best Sunscreens report.24 Remarkably, all of Consumer Reports’ recommended sunscreens contain oxybenzone. Topping their lotion and spray lists:
• Best lotion — La Roche-Posay Anthelios 60 Melt-in Sunscreen Milk (which the EWG Guide to Sunscreens, incidentally, rates among the worst, noting its active ingredient, oxybenzone, poses a moderate health concern)
• Best spray — Trader Joe’s SPF 50+ Sunscreen, which contains both oxybenzone and avobenzone

Don Huber, director of product safety at Consumer Reports, commented on the potential concerns people might have about oxybenzone saying,

The oxybenzone-free sunscreens recommended by Consumer Reports are Walgreens Hydrating SPF 50 lotion26 and Hawaiian Tropic Sheer Touch Lotion SPF 50,27 both of which contain avobenzone instead.

However, no studies have been done to confirm whether avobenzone is actually a safer choice. According to a recent Danish study,28 13 of 29 sunscreen chemicals allowed in the U.S. and/or European Union have the ability to reduce male fertility, and avobenzone is one of them.

The FDA recently proposed new regulations30 to “make sure sunscreens are safe and effective” in light of daily use. The public comment period ends May 28, 2019.31 If enacted, this could have a transformative effect on the sunscreen industry as a whole.

Importantly, as I’ve noted on a number of occasions, of all the active sunscreen ingredients used in products on the U.S. market, only two — non-nano-sized zinc oxide and titanium dioxide — have actually been deemed safe for human use by the FDA.

In its proposed rule, the FDA admits it does not have enough scientific data to draw any conclusions about the safety of 12 of the 16 active sunscreen ingredients on its list, and asks industry to help in providing more data to perform a “rigorous assessment” of all active ingredients on the market. Its pilot study was part of this current push to learn more about these ingredients.

Two of the 16 ingredients, PABA and trolamine salicylate, have been deemed unsafe, or not generally recognized as safe (GRAS), and are not currently in use, according to the FDA.

The proposal also includes broad updates to labeling requirements, as well as SPF-related changes. For the changes, FDA wants sunscreens with an SPF of 15 or higher to provide broad spectrum protection against both UVA and UVB rays, not just UVB as is currently the case.

In addition to oxybenzone, at least eight other active sunscreen ingredients are suspected of having endocrine disrupting effects.32,33 As mentioned above, recent Danish research34 has highlighted the risk to male fertility by 13 of 29 sunscreen chemicals allowed in the U.S. and/or European Union.

The researchers found these chemicals have the ability to reduce male fertility by affecting calcium signaling in sperm, in part by exerting a progesterone-like effect. Of those 13 chemicals, the following eight are approved for use in the U.S.:
• Octisalate (also known as octyl salicylate)

Many sunscreens also contain vitamin A and/or its derivatives, retinol and retinyl palmitate, which have been linked to an increased risk of skin cancer by increasing the speed at which malignant cells develop and spread.

Oxybenzone and Other Sunscreen Ingredients Are Also Neurotoxic

Research36 published in Toxicology Reports in 2017 also warn that some sunscreen ingredients — including oxybenzone — are neurotoxic (toxic to your brain). The authors noted that:
• Since sunscreens need to be applied in significant amounts all over the body, calculations — assuming a maximum skin penetration of up to 5% — suggest the total amount of a given compound being absorbed from a single application could be as high as 200 milligrams (mg) or 2.56 mg per kilo of bodyweight
• Simultaneous application of insect repellents such as DEET enhances the penetration of the compounds, thereby multiplying their potential toxicity
• Sunscreen chemicals are found in blood, urine and breast milk following application, in some cases within as little as two hours

Sunscreen ingredients found to have neurotoxic effects in this study included:37
• Octyl methoxycinnamate — Found to decrease motor activity in female rats and alter the release of a number of different neurotransmitters
• Benzophenone-3 (oxybenzone) — Decreases cell viability of neurons, and upregulates estrogenic-related genes in male animals
• Octocrylene — Impaired expression of genes related to brain development and brain metabolism

According to the researchers:38

Considering the endocrine disrupting and neurotoxic effects of oxybenzone, its high absorbability, and the availability of safe sunscreens (those containing non-nano-sized zinc oxide and titanium dioxide), it seems rather irrational and downright irresponsible of FDA, the American Academy of Dermatology and Consumer Reports to urge people to continue slathering themselves and their children with oxybenzone-containing sunscreen on a daily basis.

When selecting a sunscreen, remember there really are only two known safe sunscreen ingredients — zinc oxide and titanium dioxide39 — and they must not be nano-sized.

Your safest choice is a lotion or cream with zinc oxide, as it is stable in sunlight and provides the best protection from UVA rays.40 Your next best option is titanium dioxide. Just make sure the product does not contain nano-sized particles and protects against both UVA and UVB rays.

Also keep in mind that SPF protects only from UVB rays (although if the FDA’s proposed rules are implemented, any SPF at or above 15 must protect against both UVA and UVB), which are the rays within the ultraviolet spectrum that allow your skin to produce vitamin D.

The most dangerous rays, in terms of causing skin damage and cancer, are the UVA rays. Avoid sunscreens with an SPF above 50. While not intrinsically harmful, the higher SPF tends to provide a false sense of security, encouraging you to stay in the sun longer than you should.

Moreover, higher SPF typically does not provide much greater protection. In fact, research suggests people using high-SPF sunscreens get the same or similar exposure to UV rays as those using lower-SPF products.

What’s more, a recent analysis41 by Consumer Reports found many sunscreens are far less effective than claimed on the label; 32 of the 82 products evaluated for 2019 offered less than half the protection promised by their stated SPF. Consumer Reports said they’d seen “a similar pattern in previous years’ sunscreen tests.”

Sensible Sun Exposure Is Good for Your Health and Longevity

I recommend spending time in the sun regularly — ideally daily. Sunshine offers substantial health benefits, provided you take a few simple precautions to protect yourself from overexposure. Here are my top five sensible sunning tips:
• Give your body a chance to produce vitamin D before you apply sunscreen. Expose large amounts of your skin (at least 40 percent of your body) to sunlight for short periods daily. Vitamin D is involved in the biochemical function of nearly every cell and tissue in your body, including your immune system. When you’re deficient in vitamin D, your health can deteriorate in a variety of important ways, because your cells require the active form of vitamin D to gain access to the genetic blueprints stored inside the cell. Research42 published in the International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health in December 2018 called for an immediate revision of public health recommendations, noting that “nonburning UV exposure is a health benefit and — in moderation — should be recommended as such.” The authors warn that the public has been misled and misinformed about the health ramifications of sun avoidance, as there are significant hazards associated with vitamin D deficiency, including a heightened risk of heart disease and several cancers, especially internal cancers but also skin cancer.43 This paper also points out that an estimated 12% of all U.S. deaths may be linked to inadequate sun exposure, and that sun avoidance is as potent a risk factor for death as smoking.
• Stay out just long enough for your skin to turn the very lightest shade of pink. Shield your face from the sun using a safe sunscreen or hat, as your facial skin is thin and more prone to sun damage, such as premature wrinkling. When you’ll be in the sun for longer periods, cover up with clothing, a hat or shade (either natural or shade you create using an umbrella). A safe sunscreen can be applied after you’ve optimized your skin’s daily vitamin D production, although clothing is your safest option to prevent burning and skin damage.
• Keep in mind that in order for sunscreen to be effective, you must apply large amounts over all exposed areas of your skin. This means the product should not trigger skin allergies and must provide good protection against UVA and UVB radiation. It also should not be absorbed into your skin, as the most effective sunscreen acts as a topical barrier.
• Consider the use of an “internal sunscreen” like astaxanthin to gain additional sun protection.44,45,46,47 In one study,48 subjects who took 4 milligrams of astaxanthin per day for two weeks showed a significant increase in the amount of time necessary for UV radiation to redden their skin. On average, approximately 20% more energy was needed for skin reddening to occur. Astaxanthin can also be applied topically, which is why it’s now being incorporated into a number of topical sunscreen products. Consuming a healthy diet full of natural antioxidants is another highly useful strategy to help avoid sun damage. Fresh, raw, unprocessed foods deliver the nutrients that your body needs to maintain a healthy balance of omega-6 and animal-based DHA omega-3 oils in your skin, which are your first lines of defense against sunburn. Vegetables also provide your body with an abundance of powerful antioxidants that will help you fight the free radicals caused by sun damage that can lead to burns and cancer.

(INTELLIHUB) — A well-known surgeon who previously exposed major inadequacies in medical trauma care promised to the Haitian people by the Clinton Foundation after the non-profit raised over $30 million dollars in donations following the devastating 2010 earthquake was found dead in his Manhattan apartment on Sunday with a stab wound to the chest.

Dr. Dean Lorich, 54, was found lying dead on the bathroom floor of his upscale apartment with a knife sticking out of his chest where the surgeon’s 11-year-old daughter reportedly discovered the body.

The predominant surgeon had gained notoriety after performing operations on U2’s frontman Bono and former running back Michael Cox but the doctor had also worked overseas in Haiti where he claimed to have discovered a “nonexistent” disaster effort backed by the Clinton Foundation.

Dr. Lorich sent a detailed email to a confidant in January of 2012 which ended up getting forwarded to Cheryl Mills who was serving as Counselor and Chief of Staff to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton at the time. That very same email was later forwarded to the Madam Secretary herself, Hillary Clinton.

The doctor’s email correspondence, provided by Wikileaks, was critical of how the situation in Haiti was being handled.

“Disaster management on the ground was nonexistent,” the doctor wrote. ” Cheerios on the tarmac are not getting it done on these patients which clearly would be savable if good care could urgently be provided.”

However, the email was only a precursor to the bombshell Lorich dropped publically just days later on January 25, 2010, in a piece for CNN titled Doctors: Haiti medical situation shameful which detailed the poor humanitarian conditions overseas.

“Once we arrived, we saw a severely damaged hospital with no running water and only limited electrical power, supplied by a generator,” the doctor wrote. “Surgeries were being performed in the equivalent of a large storage closet, where amputations were performed with hacksaws…. this facility could not nearly accommodate our equipment nor our expertise to treat the volume of injuries we saw.”

After witnessing such the gruesome scene, the medical team decided to go with ‘plan b’ which was to set up at the Community Hospital of Haiti located just several miles away but what the team found when they eventually arrived at the second hospital was even more horrific.

We found scores of patients with pus dripping out of open extremity fractures and crush injuries. Some wounds were already ridden with maggots. About a third of these victims were children. The entire hospital smelled of infected, rotting limbs and death. Later on, we would judge our surgical progress by the diminishment of the stench. In our naïveté, we didn’t expect that the two anesthesia machines would not work; that there would be only one cautery available in the entire hospital to stop bleeding; that an operating room sterilizer fit only instruments the size of a cigar box; that there would be no sterile saline, no functioning fluoroscopy machine, no blood for transfusions, no ability to do lab work; and the only local staff was a ragtag group of voluntary health providers who, like us, had made it there on their own.

As a caveat, the doctor added: “Upon our departure, we witnessed pallets of Cheerios and dry goods sitting on the tarmac helping nobody. Yet our flight of critical medical equipment and personnel had been canceled, and the equipment that did get through was hijacked.”

Was the doctor murdered? If so, who murdered him? Please comment and share.

14,2,"In the 1960s, the sugar industry funded research that downplayed the risks of sugar and highlighted the hazards of fat, according to a newly published article in JAMA Internal Medicine.

The article draws on internal documents to show that an industry group called the Sugar Research Foundation wanted to “refute” concerns about sugar’s possible role in heart disease. The SRF then sponsored research by Harvard scientists that did just that. The result was published in the New England Journal of Medicine in 1967, with no disclosure of the sugar industry funding.

The sugar-funded project in question was a literature review, examining a variety of studies and experiments. It suggested there were major problems with all the studies that implicated sugar, and concluded that cutting fat out of American diets was the best way to address coronary heart disease.

The authors of the new article say that for the past five decades, the sugar industry has been attempting to influence the scientific debate over the relative risks of sugar and fat.

“It was a very smart thing the sugar industry did, because review papers, especially if you get them published in a very prominent journal, tend to shape the overall scientific discussion,” co-author Stanton Glantz told The New York Times.

In the article, published Monday, authors Glantz, Cristin Kearns and Laura Schmidt aren’t trying make the case for a link between sugar and coronary heart disease. Their interest is in the process. They say the documents reveal the sugar industry attempting to influence scientific inquiry and debate.

The researchers note that they worked under some limitations — “We could not interview key actors involved in this historical episode because they have died,” they write. Other organizations were also advocating concerns about fat, they note.

There’s no evidence that the SRF directly edited the manuscript published by the Harvard scientists in 1967, but there is “circumstantial” evidence that the interests of the sugar lobby shaped the conclusions of the review, the researchers say.

For one thing, there’s motivation and intent. In 1954, the researchers note, the president of the SRF gave a speech describing a great business opportunity.

If Americans could be persuaded to eat a lower-fat diet — for the sake of their health — they would need to replace that fat with something else. America’s per capita sugar consumption could go up by a third.

But in the ’60s, the SRF became aware of “flowing reports that sugar is a less desirable dietary source of calories than other carbohydrates,” as John Hickson, SRF vice president and director of research, put it in one document.

He recommended that the industry fund its own studies — “Then we can publish the data and refute our detractors.”

The next year, after several scientific articles were published suggesting a link between sucrose and coronary heart disease, the SRF approved the literature-review project. It wound up paying approximately $50,000 in today’s dollars for the research.

One of the researchers was the chairman of Harvard’s Public Health Nutrition Department — and an ad hoc member of SRF’s board.

“A different standard” for different studies

Glantz, Kearns and Schmidt say many of the articles examined in the review were hand-selected by SRF, and it was implied that the sugar industry would expect them to be critiqued.

In a letter, SRF’s Hickson said that the organization’s “particular interest” was in evaluating studies focused on “carbohydrates in the form of sucrose.”

“We are well aware,” one of the scientists replied, “and will cover this as well as we can.”

The project wound up taking longer than expected, because more and more studies were being released that suggested sugar might be linked to coronary heart disease. But it was finally published in 1967.

Hickson was certainly happy with the result: “Let me assure you this is quite what we had in mind and we look forward to its appearance in print,” he told one of the scientists.

The review minimized the significance of research that suggested sugar could play a role in coronary heart disease. In some cases the scientists alleged investigator incompetence or flawed methodology.

“It is always appropriate to question the validity of individual studies,” Kearns told Bloomberg via email. But, she says, “the authors applied a different standard” to different studies — looking very critically at research that implicated sugar, and ignoring problems with studies that found dangers in fat.

Epidemiological studies of sugar consumption — which look at patterns of health and disease in the real world — were dismissed for having too many possible factors getting in the way. Experimental studies were dismissed for being too dissimilar to real life.

One study that found a health benefit when people ate less sugar and more vegetables was dismissed because that dietary change was not feasible.

Another study, in which rats were given a diet low in fat and high in sugar, was rejected because “such diets are rarely consumed by man.”

The Harvard researchers then turned to studies that examined risks of fat — which included the same kind of epidemiological studies they had dismissed when it came to sugar.

Citing “few study characteristics and no quantitative results,” as Kearns, Glantz and Schmidt put it, they concluded that cutting out fat was “no doubt” the best dietary intervention to prevent coronary heart disease.

Sugar lobby: “Transparency standards were not the norm”

In a statement, the Sugar Association — which evolved out of the SRF — said it is challenging to comment on events from so long ago.

“We acknowledge that the Sugar Research Foundation should have exercised greater transparency in all of its research activities, however, when the studies in question were published funding disclosures and transparency standards were not the norm they are today,” the association said.

“Generally speaking, it is not only unfortunate but a disservice that industry-funded research is branded as tainted,” the statement continues. “What is often missing from the dialogue is that industry-funded research has been informative in addressing key issues.”

The documents in question are five decades old, but the larger issue is of the moment, as Marion Nestle notes in a commentary in the same issue of JAMA Internal Medicine:

As for the article authors who dug into the documents around this funding, they offer two suggestions for the future.

“Policymaking committees should consider giving less weight to food industry-funded studies,” they write.

They also call for new research into any ties between added sugars and coronary heart disease."

18,2,"Research shows high altitude increases depression and suicide, especially for women

 POSTED 6:34 PM, APRIL 1, 2019, BY ADAM HERBETS, SALT LAKE CITY – Researchers at the University of Utah believe people who live at higher altitudes can become more depressed than people who live closer to sea level. The effect, they say, is especially noticeable in women. Dr. Shami Kanekar … has studied the negative effects of altitude for years. Her research has shown that men and women donât feel the effects of typical antidepressants at higher elevations. Experiments also seem to indicate that women go through a chemical change in their brain when exposed to anything at or above âmoderateâ elevation, even for a relatively short period of time, Kanekar said. âYou see higher depression, higher anxiety in females, while males donât seem to have that change,â Kanekar said. Depression can lead to suicide, and suicide rates in Utah are significantly higher than the national average.

The Mountain West has fairly high suicide rates. Whether that’s due to high gun ownership, altitude or whatever I don’t know.

Anyway, I don’t know how good this researcher’s evidence is, but I’m always interested in medical research into the effects of altitude. I’ve been fascinated by altitude ever since I was introduced to topographic maps as an 11 year old Boy Scout.

There are a lot of beautiful places to retire to between Denver and Lake Tahoe, but it’s also tough to predict how your body will hold up to thin air later in life. This striked me as a relatively important topic for research, but I haven’t seen much research into this yet.

This strikes me as a relatively important topic for research, but I haven’t seen much research into this yet.

Sci-fi author Robert Heinlein lived in Colorado Springs (elevation at least 6000 feet) from the late 1940s to the late 1960s. His books from this era (e.g., Have Space Suit, Will Travel) are often obsessed with air pressure. Heinlein had major cerebral problems from 1966-1969 and couldn’t write (that’s why his 1966 novel The Moon Is A Harsh Mistress represents his peak as a novelist). When he finally recovered, he found himself rich and famous due to hippies taking up Stranger in a Strange Land. He moved to Santa Cruz, CA to live at sea level."
19,2,"Don’t think it is such a far-fetched idea. There’s even a book about it:

Remnant Newspaper In The Mosque of Notre Dame, set in 2048, Muslims from Arabia and middle Europe have taken over the governments of Western Europe and locked down the countries under Sharia Law—minarets, burkas, and all.

Picture Paris’s l’Arc de Triomphe as the staging ground for the stoning of wine makers. Imagine the Louvre bare and stripped of all of it works of art. And consider the grand cathedral of Notre-Dame de Paris converted into a Mosque, complete with his ’n’ hers footbaths. (By the way, the Basilica of St. Peter in Rome has been flattened and turned into a garbage dump.)

How did this nightmare become the reality in the motherland of civilization? A lack of faith and lack of fight left the old lands of Christendom defenseless against massive, calculated immigration into a timid West that has grown too selfish to stand up for itself.

The Mosque of Notre Dame fixes blame for the Muslim takeover right where it belongs: on the failure of the Catholic Church and the Orthodox Church to evangelize—and in particular, the failure of post-Vatican II Church leaders to assert the Church’s unique claim on the truth.

The book was written by Elena Chudinova, a Russian, who is a Traditionalist Catholic from Moscow. It has enjoyed great success in the “front-line” nations where Islam and the West are colliding. Originally published in Russian in 2006, it has been translated into French, Serbian, Polish, Bulgarian, Turkish, and Norwegian. The first American edition appears finally here in 2015, published by Michael Matt’s The Remnant Press."

Basically, Dirksen made a documentary on people living in tiny houses. For around five years she was traveling the world and filming these segments.

Kirsten Dirksen is co-founder of faircompanies.com and a Huffington Post blogger. She has worked for MTV, Oxygen, The Travel Channel and Sundance Channel.

From the author: I still live in a relatively spacious 1000 square foot apartment with my family of 4 (soon-to-be 5) and I’m not looking to downsize, but I can’t get enough of these tiny homes. I’m sure there’s something Thoreauvian in my attraction to the examined lives of those who inhabit them.

I continue to be impressed by how so many Tiny House People have been able to let go of their stuff and not despite, but because of this, find a certain calm. This very Buddhist/Gandhian/Stoic concept of non-attachment as a path to happiness is hardly new.

Over 2 millennia ago Socrates counseled, “The secret of happiness, you see, is not found in seeking more, but in developing the capacity to enjoy less.”"

23,2,"Israelâs public face, sustained and propagated by a wealthy and powerful diaspora that has significant control over the media, insists that the country is the Middle Eastâs only true democracy, that is operates under a rule of law for all its citizens and that its army is the âmost moral in the world.â All of those assertions are false. Israelâs government favors its Jewish citizens through laws and regulations that are defined by religion. It in fact now identifies itself legally as a Jewish state with Christians and Muslim citizens having second class status. Israelâs army, meanwhile, has committed numerous war crimes against largely unarmed civilian populations in the past seventy years, both in Lebanon and directed against the Palestinians on the West Bank and Gaza.

In response to the past yearâs Great March of Return protests staged by Gazans along the fence line that separates them from Israel, Israeli army snipers have shot dead 293 Palestinians and wounded seven thousand more. Twenty-thousand other Gazans have been harmed by other weapons used by the Israelis, to include canisters from the volleys of tear gas and rubber bullets. The numbers include hundreds of children and medical personnel trying to help the wounded, which reportedly have been particularly targeted.

The United Nations has reported that many of the wounded have been shot in their legs, which the Israeli army regards as “restraint” on its part. Many of those injured will likely need to have limbs amputated because Gaza lacks the medical facilities required to properly treat their wounds. Israel has bombed hospitals and blocked the importation of medical supplies into Gaza while also not allowing Gazans to leave the enclave for medical treatment elsewhere in the Middle East.

One hundred and twenty amputations have already been performed this year. Jamie McGoldrick, the U.N. Humanitarian Coordinator for the Occupied Territories explained âYouâve got 1,700 people who are in need of serious, complicated surgeries for them to be able to walk againâ¦[requiring] very, very serious and complex bone reconstruction surgery over a two-year period before they start to rehabilitate themselves.â

The U.N. would like to provide $20 million in assistance to enable medical treatment rather than amputations but the United States has refused to support emergency funding for the Palestinians through the Relief Works Agency (UNRWA), a step presumably taken to benefit Israel by punishing the Palestinian people.

Interestingly, a document has recent re-surfaced describing in chilling terms the Israel Armyâs viewpoint on shooting protesting Arabs. One year ago former British diplomat Craig Murray posted on his blog, âCondemned By Their Own Wordsâ, which provided a translated from Hebrew-to-English transcript of an Israeli radio broadcast that had taken place on April 21st. An Israeli Brigadier-General, named Zvika Fogel, was responding to reports of the killing by soldiers of an unarmed fourteen year-old boy. He explained in some detail why his soldiers are absolutely doing the right thing to shoot to kill Palestinians who approach the barrier separating Gaza from Israel.

General Fogelâs comments are reflective of the Israeli government view of how to control the âPalestinian problem.â Only the rights, including the right to life, of Israeli Jews are legitimate and Arabs should be grateful for what the Jewish state allows them to have.

Fogel responded to interviewer Ron Nesielâs first question âShould the IDF [Israeli army] rethink its use of snipers?â by saying that âAny person who gets close to the fence, anyone who could be a future threat to the border of the State of Israel and its residents, should bear a price for that violation. If this child or anyone else gets close to the fence in order to hide an explosive device or check if there are any dead zones there or to cut the fence so someone could infiltrate the territory of the State of Israel to kill us â¦â

Nesiel: âThen, then his punishment is death?â

Fogel: âHis punishment is death. As far as Iâm concerned then yes, if you can only shoot him to stop him, in the leg or arm â great. But if itâs more than that then, yes, you want to check with me whose blood is thicker, ours or theirs. It is clear to you that if one such person will manage to cross the fence or hide an explosive device there â¦â

Nesiel: âBut we were taught that live fire is only used when the soldiers face immediate danger. â¦ It does not do all that well for us, those pictures that are distributed around the world.â

Fogel: âI know how these orders are given. I know how a sniper does the shooting. I know how many authorizations he needs before he receives an authorization to open fire. It is not the whim of one or the other sniper who identifies the small body of a child now and decides heâll shoot. Someone marks the target for him very well and tells him exactly why one has to shoot and what the threat is from that individual. And to my great sorrow, sometimes when you shoot at a small body and you intended to hit his arm or shoulder it goes even higher. The picture is not a pretty picture. But if thatâs the price that we have to pay to preserve the safety and quality of life of the residents of the State of Israel, then thatâs the price.

â[And] look, Ron, weâre even terrible at it [at suppressing those pictures]. Thereâs nothing to be done, David always looks better against Goliath. And in this case, we are the Goliath. Not the David. That is entirely clear to me. â¦ It will drag us into a war. I do not want to be on the side that gets dragged. I want to be on the side that initiates things. I do not want to wait for the moment where it finds a weak spot and attacks me there. If tomorrow morning it gets into a military base or a kibbutz and kills people there and takes prisoners of war or hostages, call it as you like, weâre in a whole new script. I want the leaders of Hamas to wake up tomorrow morning and for the last time in their life see the smiling faces of the IDF. Thatâs what I want to have happen. But we are dragged along. So weâre putting snipers up because we want to preserve the values we were educated by. We canât always take a single picture and put it before the whole world. We have soldiers there, our children, who were sent out and receive very accurate instructions about whom to shoot to protect us. Letâs back them up.â

One might reasonably suggest that Fogelâs comments reflect a consensus among Israelis on how to deal with the Arabs. And the United States is fully complicit in the slaughter. American Ambassador to Israel David Friedman has repeatedly praised the restraint of the Israeli armed forces and has blamed the Gazans for their plight. The United States continues to subsidize illegal Israeli settlements that fuel the conflict and is putting the final touches on an Israeli approved peace plan that will now and forever make the Palestinians a non-people, without a nation of their own and without any hopes for the future. Meanwhile, they are target practice for Israeli snipers. The world should be mortified by Israeli arrogance and behavior and the United States should bow its head in shame each time a pandering American politician comes out with the line âIsrael has a right to defend itself.â

24,2,"A senior journalist says various British government schemes on tackling terrorism, specially during the three-year reign of Theresa May as prime minister, have encouraged hate crimes against Muslims in the country.

Edna Mohamed, a columnist writing for the Independent, said on Sunday that increased use of surveillance technologies in the UK over the past years and a government scheme called Prevent, which seeks to prevent radicalization of the youth in Britain, have contributed to the normalization of Islamophobia in the country.

“Those who cannot perform “Britishness”, whatever and however that is supposed to look like, become suspects in the wider state apparatus of control,” said Mohamed in her column published on Independent’s website.

The analyst said that many Muslims and members of other communities have been unfairly targeted under Prevent, a legislation passed in 2011 that expanded under May, both when she was interior minister and when she became prime minister in 2016.

Mohamed said the increased use of technology for monitoring people’s lives also escalated under May, saying her era as prime minister, which effectively ended on June 7 when she resigned, represented a “golden age” of surveillance in the UK.

Mahamed warned that since there were no laws governing the use of surveillance data, security agencies could freely use the information against people without ever worrying about legal consequences.

As an example, she referred to the police's use of facial recognition Wales last year to identify peaceful protesters at an anti-arms rally, a move that led to a huge backlash around intrusive surveillance.

She said Conservative lawmakers seeking to replace May have all supported mass surveillance of people’s communications and activities, adding that problems for minorities in the UK would intensify in the future.

“With May now officially out of office, it would be naive to assume that surveillance under any of her predecessors would be anything less than repressive,” said Mohamed."

26,2,"10th day into demonetisation and things are going from bad to worse. There is mayhem everywhere. We have already had reports of suicides, murders, robberies, cyclones, earthquakes, and Rohit Sharma’s ouster from Indian squad because of demonetisation, and now we have the first case of HIV that this dreadful ban has caused.

The incident happened when a man contracted the disease from an already infected ATM machine in Mumbai. Despite numerous warnings issued by India Today and other media houses about ATM keypads transmitting the virus, he went to an ATM and touched the dangerous keypad. He was later diagnosed with HIV positive.

“So did he actually have sex with the machine?” we asked an insider from India Today.

“No, but withdrawing cash is as good as having sex with the machine. You have more or less the same feeling when you get the cash in your hand,” he affirmed.

“Ok that’s interesting. So the engineering students are not virgins anymore and they can proudly brag about their sex lives.”

“So, who is at risk of catching the virus? Someone with a poor immune system?”

“No, anyone who is withdrawing cash from an ATM.”

“You mean, balance inquiries and other transactions are safe, right?”

“Who stands in the queue for 3 hours to check balance?”

“Oh ok, you are talking about the current scenario.”

“Yes, people should avoid an ATM machine at any cost because it may cause STD as our researcher suggested, and once you are infected with an STD, you become more susceptible to HIV infection.”

“And who is the researcher at India Today you are referring to? Is it Rajdeep Sardesai?”

“No, he is in Goa. The person who published the report is Jane Carlton.”

“Ok but the report was published in 2014. Why are you linking it to currency ban?”

“But what made you search the report two years after it was published and exactly at a time when people are desperately trying to use ATMs? We are just curious, what was going through your mind when you decided to look it up and what were the keywords you entered into Google that returned this report?”

“Listen, I think I am done with the interview. If you have more questions then ask Rajdeep Sardesai. I am going to call him. Here are your boxing gloves.”

“But you said he is in Goa,” we hurriedly wrapped-up the interview."
27,2,"Jack Kerwick, who holds a doctorate in philosophy from Temple University and teaches at various colleges in the Philadelphia area, is a talented polemicist as well as learned academic. For those who want to sample the unleashed Jack Kerwick, I recommend his recent anthology The American Offensive, available in Kindle or paperback.

Jack is a commentator on multiple websites, and (unlike myself) is allowed to post on the GOP Establishment forum Townhall.com. As I read over his pieces there, I sometimes gape in disbelief. Jack is one of the few commentators on Townhall who pushes the anti-PC envelope. (Pat Buchanan and Ann Coulter do too, but both of these celebrities are far better connected than Jack—and no doubt harder to get rid of).

Not surprisingly, not all of Jack’s pieces are accepted by Townhall or by the neoconservative FrontpageMag, which is also one of his outlets. Those of his commentaries that seem (to use his term) “too insensitive” for Conservatism, Inc. go on to his BeliefNet page, and from there at least some of them have found their way into The American Offensive.

Jack covers lots of topics, including theology (he is a traditional, practicing Catholic); the growing epidemic of PC on American campuses; and the “reality” of race. Jack rarely discusses the media, the two institutionalized parties and his fellow academics without going for the jugular. He is tough-as-nails on the anti-white rage of “civil rights spokespersons” (What else would one expect from a white Catholic ethnic from Trenton, N.J.?). But reserves his harshest invective for whites who excuse blacks for their astronomic crime rates.

One truly fascinating commentary is his analysis of “blackism” as the recognizable worldview of our president. In contrast to the representatives of Conservatism, Inc., Jack does not view Obama as first and foremost a “socialist” without a foreign policy. Rather he sees him as a blackist who “affirms an explicitly—and thoroughly—racial conception of history.” Bam’s socialism does not drive his ideology.

As a “proponent of blackism,” Obama embraces socialism, because he believes, rightly or wrongly, that it will benefit his race. Blackists further believe, Kerwick says, that

Blackism also requires from “all of its adherents in good standing” that they “express some measure of indignation or rage regarding the historical injustice suffered by blacks and the persistent omnipresence of—what else?—white racism.” Blackists “unabashedly heed the call for ‘social’ or ‘racial justice’” for this means, in effect that ”a robust and activist government…will possess the power necessary to compensate blacks for the past harms that had been visited upon them by white racism.”

Finally in what Jack describes as “the Cliff’s Note” of blackist ideology, obviously absorbed by President Obama and his black supporters, “is the idea of ‘racial authenticity.’ Racial authenticity can be achieved, it promises, by way of the very simple act of affirming blackism!”

Jack quotes Malcolm X on the cultural implications of blackism, particularly the exhibition of revulsion for Christianity as the religion of white colonists and the association of America’s founding with anti-black racism. In the words of Malcolm X, blacks “didn’t land on Plymouth Rock” but “Plymouth Rock landed” on blacks.

Jack acknowledges that Obama, who in the last election won 38% of the white vote, has had to cloak his blackism. But he cites Obama’s speeches and comments to show that the same ideology and resentments that were found in Malcolm X periodically surface in the current occupant of the Oval Office.

Jack argues that it’s perfectly compatible with “blackism” that Obama, in his National Prayer Breakfast reminder of Christian iniquities in what was supposed to be a criticism of ISIS violence, turned his remarks in a blackist direction: “In one and the same breath he speaks of both a white segregationist’s refusal to associate with blacks and an Islamic fanatic’s refusal to grant mercy to a person he cages and eventually burns to death.”

It is not just Obama’s “historical illiteracy” and “moral idiocy” that account for these rhetorical eccentricities. There is an anti-white, anti-Western ideology that drives it. Thus when “he talks of ‘we’ in implying moral parity between Islamic violence and the violence perpetrated by Christians in the past,” “what he is really saying is that you—all of you white Christians—must not shed any of that white guilt that’s paid off so well for the Barack Obamas of the world.”

Jack is even tougher on those white scribblers who seem to be truckling to “blackists,” particularly faux conservatives whom he takes apart with obvious delectation. For example, in the wake of the Michael Brown shooting, Kevin Williamson of National Review took to his high horse to complain about the “militarized police” in Ferguson, ,Missouri and across the US. This for Jack exemplifies his charge that when the Left complains about racism, Conservatism, Inc. respectfully dissents, but also puts itself at a safe distance from the real Right.

As further evidence of this, Jack cites National Review’s Reihan Salaam, who also writes regularly for the left-wing publication Slate, on the outrage of “intra-racial dating.” Salaam expresses shock that so many people (presumably it’s the white ones he’s talking about) manifest strong“same-race preferences” on dating sites like OKCupid. “One assumes”, Salaam opines, “that many people who do have such preferences would either choose not to disclose them publicly or choose to skip the question entirely.” [Is It Racist to Date Only People of Your Own Race? Yes., Slate, April 22 2014] Jack shows that Salaam, and at least implicitly his employer, believes that there is a positive duty to miscegenate.

Although Salaam would probably be pleased to use government to bring this about, such a project (alas) does not seem feasible. He therefore urges for starters that all social and educational institutions encourage interracial dining. Not one to deny deserved credit, Salaam insists: “The rural white Southerner who dines with nonwhites as a matter of course is doing more to tackle stigma than the urbane white hipster who hardly ever does the same.”

Jack ends his comments on Salaam’s homily by observing that what should be treated as a bad college freshman essay has been “published in a widely-read venue (however much of a rag).” And this “is a truly scandalous commentary on the intellectual and moral state of our culture.”

But Jack has barely scratched the surface of the kind of leftist claptrap that “conservative” publications now fill their pages with. Thus he quotes the longtime, nationally syndicated “conservative” columnist Paul Greenberg waxing orgasmic “over President Obama’s decision to grant amnesty to millions of illegal aliens.” Like Obama (and AEI- fixture Linda Chavez), Greenberg insists that not legalizing illegals is incompatible “with the America we know and still want to believe in.”

Apparently the America that Greenberg and other neoconservatives wish us “to believe in” bears a striking similarity to President Obama’s.

28,2,"President Donald Trump has announced an immigration reform deal with the Mexican government which likely will allow border officials to end the catch-and-release of Central American migrants.

Ending catch-and-release is a huge win for Americans and Trump because it means border officials now have a legal alternative to the catch-and-release rules which allow migrants to legally enter the United States if they bring children and claim asylum.

Those catch-and-release rules set by Congress and the courts also allow the migrants to get work permits before their asylum court hearings, which are now backlogged for two or more years.

Instead of catch-and-release, the migrants can be returned to Mexico until their asylum claims can be heard by a judge.

The “joint declaration” was outlined in a State Department message:

… those [migrants] crossing the U.S. Southern Border to seek asylum will be rapidly returned to Mexico where they may await the adjudication of their [US.] asylum claims. In response, Mexico will authorize the entrance of all of those individuals for humanitarian reasons, in compliance with its international obligations, while they await the adjudication of their asylum claims. Mexico will also offer jobs, healthcare, and education according to its principles. The United States commits to work to accelerate the adjudication of asylum claims and to conclude removal proceeding as expeditiously as possible. Both parties also agree that, in the event the measure adopted do not have the expected results, they will take further actions.

29,2,"What Happened: Germany is starting a universal basic income trial where volunteers will get a $1400 dollar payment every single month as part of a study that will compare the experiences of 120 volunteers who receive it to 1,380 people who won’t. A total of 140,000 people have come together to help fund the study after the idea of a universal basic income continues to gain popularity. Germany is not the only country who has begun such initiatives, Finland also did something similar a few years ago, and proponents of the initiative believe it would improve peoples’ lives and reduce inequality, among other things. Opposition arguments to this type of initiative suggest that it would simply be unaffordable, too expensive and also discourage work.

Jürgen Schupp, who is leading the study, told the German newspaper Der Spiegel that it would improve the debate about universal basic income by producing new scientific evidence.

“The debate about the basic income has so far been like a philosophical salon in good moments and a war of faith in bad times,” he told the newspaper.

Universal basic income is not really supported by any of the major political parties across the globe, especially in Germany.

Why This Is Important: A quote often attributed to Henry Ford reads as follows, “It is well enough that people of the nation do not understand our banking and monetary system, for if they did, I believe there would be a revolution before tomorrow morning.” Isn’t it odd that the financial elite can simply print money at will? How come when we do it it’s called counterfitting, but when they do it it’s called increasing the money supply? These people can literally create money out of thin air, and the more I understand the concept of fractional reserve banking, the more I realize that money is simply a tool to in-slave and control the human race while benefiting a select few. This becomes easier to see when you follow the money.

Do we not have the potential to create something better on our planet? Is money really needed, or could we all come together, cooperate and find a better way? If we are going to use this creation of ours, could it not be used in a better and more efficient way?

“As I followed the money I’ve learned that everything I once believed about money is simply not true.” – Foster Gamble

If you want to learn more about the system, you can refer to this article that goes into more detail: The Real Purpose of the Federal Reserve Banking System.

I believe these questions are important, as many of us have been made to believe that our financial system is for the greater good, and that it’s efficient and the only possible way to operate here on our planet. When it comes to the world of finance, our minds are stuck inside of a box.

When it comes to universal basic income, is it really too expensive? For those who believe it is not feasible, did you know that Mark Skidmore, a Michigan State University economist teamed up with multiple researchers, including Catherine Austin Fitts, former assistant secretary of Housing and Urban Development, and found trillions of unaccounted for dollars missing from housing & D.O.D? Did you know that trillions of dollars are going into “black budget” programs that the president, for example, has no idea about? Did you know that there is no branch or agency of government that can overrule actions that the Federal Reserve takes? It’s simple, if you control the money supply, if you are the printer and the maker of money, you control the population and can create the experience you want humans to live inside.

The researchers found documents indicating a total of $20 trillion of undocumented adjustments had been made, from 1998 to 2015. The original government documents and a report describing the issue can be found here where updates are continually provided.

Imagine if this $21 trillion was allocated to a universal income package? Big financial institutions seem to have no issue with constantly printing money when they need it, but when it comes to concepts of universal income, there are always excuses. Ask yourself, is it really too expensive when this type of misallocation of money is happening?

The problem doesn’t really seem that we don’t have enough money, the issue is that the monetary system is used for control and money is allocated, both legally and illegally, to projects that don’t have the best interests of humanity at hand. The system would work better of the world of finance was not dominated by global elitist agendas seeking control and power. Perhaps it would work better if these people were actually making decisions based on what’s best for humanity.

It’s a complicated topic, a deep one that I would have to go in depth into the fraud, corruption and intentions behind our modern day banking system.

I believe humanity is more than capable of creating a human experience that doesn’t require money. We are extremely advanced, and we already have the means to create an experience where everybody’s basic needs can be met without the requirement for work. This can come as a result of various technological advancements, cooperation not competition, and more.

This is why shifting human consciousness is so paramount.

I believe that solutions exist, yet any type of solution that threatens to uproot our economy and how it currently operates never sees the light of day, and some of these developments are kept from public eye due to ‘national security’ concerns. Today, national security has become an umbrella term to classify technology and information that threatens corporate interests. This is why Julian Assange is in jail.

For example, most countries have an Invention Secrecy Act. Are certain technologies that threaten our current economic system that’s based on the idea that resources are scarce, a threat to scarcity? Is technology that could provide abundance to all hidden from the public simply because they threaten those with large amounts of power? What type of technology is under restriction under the Invention Secrecy Act? We don’t really know, but a previous list from 1971 was obtained by researcher Michael Ravnitzky. Most of the technology listed seems to be related to various military applications. You can view that list HERE.

As Steven Aftergood from the Federation of American Scientists reports:

You can read more about the Invention Secrecy Act here.

There have been even more efficient developments.

What if I told you all of our homes could be powered by nature, without the need to be reliant on the corporation, without the need for gas, coal, oil, fossil fuels etc…These are a few of many examples that would be included in a world that would operate without the need to pay for your life, or services that should be everybody’s birth right.

There are many examples of this, Paramahamsa Tewari, a physicist and inventor, who won early commendation by Nobel Laureates in physics for his revolutionary Space Vortex Theory, published a paper in Physics Essays (2018) explaining his theory, from which he built an electrical generator capable of achieving over-unity efficiency. You can watch a video of him and his machine here. Why isn’t humanity exploring these concepts that could lift our dependence on big energy corporations and eliminate scarcity of resources, openly, freely and transparently?

Again, energy generation is one of many examples, there are many solutions to all of our issues from food, to environmental degradation and more.

It seems that when it comes to solutions that can help ‘free’ the human race, even just a little bit with the idea of universal basic income, it is sharply opposed by all major political parties, just like it is in Germany.

Any type of bartering system, or monetary system that is controlled by the citizenry, like Bitcoin for example, also always faces harsh opposition, or an attempt to gain control over it ensues. There are people out there who desire power and control above anything else, and the money supply represents the center of that control.

The truth is, a thriving society will be one that’s devoid of any reliance on governments/federal regulatory agencies. Our various systems are put in place and structured in a way to make it easy for us to be controlled, and for the “1 percent” to thrive. Right now, we are their worker bees and we choose to uphold the system and are taught, through education, to justify it and see it as necessary without ever using our imagination to ponder how it could be different.

We have so much potential, and we can do much better than we are currently doing.

I often think about how absurd it is to live on a planet where you can die if you are unable to pay for your life. Having worked in this field for a number of years now, and as stated above, solutions exist to change our world and kick our dependence on corrupt governments and organizations. We could be in the stars by now. Life doesn’t have to be this way, if we continue operating from our current level of consciousness our planet will continue to be destroyed. There are better ways to do things here, and providing all citizens with a basic income, whether they are currently earning or not, is a fantastic place to start as it is clearly possible given all of the money that’s spend on measures that don’t really make sense."
30,2,"Today marks the 65th anniversary that the west carried out a coup in Iran that destabilized the county by overthrowing the country’s democratically elected leader, Mohammad Mossadeq, and installed a CIA-groomed dictator.

What was once considered a conspiracy theory is now a fact as the government has since admitted to carrying out Operation Ajax that was planned by the CIA in conjunction with MI6 in the UK to exploit the Iranian people and steal their oil on behalf of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company (AIOC) – the British state-owned oil company established in 1908 with this objective in mind and the forerunner of today’s global oil conglomerate BP.

As TFTP reported last year, the State Department released a trove of documents that give insight into the CIA’s role in the 1953 coup d’état that led to the overthrow of Iranian Prime Minister Mohammad Mossadeq.

The newly declassified documents, titled “Foreign Relations of the United States, 1952-1954, Iran, 1951–1954,” provide a notable difference from the State Department’s 1989 version of the coup, which left out any involvement from American and British intelligence.

A memorandum from Director of Central Intelligence Allen Dulles to President Eisenhower, dated March 1, 1953, serves as a reminder that internally, “the elimination of Mossadeq by assassination or otherwise,” was used as a method in repairing ties with Iran, restoring oil negotiations, and stopping a “Communist takeover.”

“Ever since the assassination of General Razmara in March 1951, and the subsequent impasse and diplomatic break with Britain over the oil negotiations, the Iranian situation has been slowly disintegrating. The result has been a steady decrease in the power and influence of the Western democracies and the building up of a situation where a Communist takeover is becoming more and more of a possibility. However, even the present crisis is likely to be unsatisfactorily compromised without a Communist Tudeh victory. Of course, the elimination of Mossadeq by assassination or otherwise might precipitate decisive events except in the unlikely alternative that the Shah should regain courage and decisiveness.”

Another memorandum from the CIA, dated March 3, 1953, detailed the “Capabilities of CIA clandestine services in Iran,” which could be used to “prevent the assumption of power by Tudeh,” Iran’s Communist party.

The list included mass propaganda means; personal denunciations and rumor spreading; street riots, demonstrations, and mobs; and providing assistance in Iran “After Tudeh Take-Over.”

While the conversations initially supported Mossadeq as Iran’s prime minister, the tone soon changed, and a memorandum from the CIA, dated March 18, 1953, noted that top State Department officials had begun discussing “The general subject of Mossadeq’s continuance in office.”

“Gist of discussion was to effect that situation has materially altered since December. While there is no obvious choice in sight to replace Mossadeq it is felt that any assets which could be rallied to support a replacement should, if at all possible, he preserved for at least a few months more until the course of events may be clarified.”

In addition to its array of “services” listed above, that were used to control the situation in Iran, the CIA also advised the soon-to-be leaders. In a memorandum, dated August 14, 1953, the CIA detailed a meeting with Fazlollah Zahedi, the Iranian general who would become Mossadeq’s replacement.

In a memorandum, dated August 17, 1953, the CIA revealed its attempts to control public opinion after the coup, by telling Kermit Roosevelt, the director of the operation, that the State advised its “press relations people” to stay away from terms such as “coup d’état” and “plot,” while working to convince the public that if there was a coup, it was on behalf of Mossadeq—not Zahedi. Two days later, they carried it out. Roosevelt should be advised that State has passed the word to VOA and instructed its own press relations people to avoid any such terminology as ‘coup d’état,’ ‘plot,’ etc., and that while playing the story ‘straight’ they should play up the fact that there is another version of the story supported by both Zahedi and now the Shah which indicates that if there was any coup d’état it was that of Mossadegh and not of Zahedi. The archive includes nearly 1,000 pages of documents, and while it is significant in framing the stage for today’s relations between the United States and Iran, it also important based on the fact that it is information the U.S. has attempted to bury. The idea that the CIA would meddle in a sovereign nation, work to overthrow its government, and then influence public perception, is nothing new in 2018. And yet, despite years of revelations, regime-change wars and failed proxy governments, there is still a perception among the American people that the government interfering with countries that have done nothing to the U.S., all in the name of “freedom.” Matt Agorist is an honorably discharged veteran of the USMC and former intelligence operator directly tasked by the NSA.

 Tehran’s military displayed a brand-new indigenous air defense missile system, capable of tracking and shooting down six targets at the same time. The weapon was rolled out amid growing tensions around the Persian Gulf.

 Iran unveiled its new domestically-designed air defense missile system Khordad 15 on Sunday. Equipped with long-range Sayyad 3 missiles, it can shoot down enemy jets and combat drones at a range of 120 kilometers, Defense Minister Brigadier General Amir Hatami said.

 The complex can also track “stealth targets,” intercepting them 45 km away. Overall, the weapon can destroy six targets simultaneously, according to military officials.

35,2,"After a bombshell report detailing near-daily interactions with unidentified flying objects by Navy pilots in 2014 and 2015, Christopher Mellon has argued that this information is nothing new, and the government needs to do something about it.Mellon, former Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Intelligence, is involved with a new History Channel series, 'Unidentified,' which will expand on topics discussed in a recent New York Times article. In numerous interviews, Navy pilots revealed that they saw UFOs moving at hypersonic speeds, performing acts ""beyond the physical limits of a human crew,"" and emitting ""no visible engine or infrared exhaust plumes.""In a Wednesday morning interview with ""Fox & Friends,"" Mellon, who has written extensively on the topic before, outlined the reasons the Navy is concerned about these sightings.""We know that UFOs exist. This is no longer an issue,"" he said.There are indications, Mellon said, that the objects reported by Navy pilots in 2014 and 2015The speeds being reported (about 5,000 miles per hour, according to Mellon) were only sustainable for about an hour by an aircraft in the air, and these objects would be flying around all day long, the pilots said.""Pilots observing these craft are absolutely mystified and that comes through clearly in their public statements,"" Mellon continued.Fascination turned to fear one day, however, when a Super Hornet pilot said he almost collided with one of the objects - which he described as a sphere encasing a cube. An official report was filed, and""These are reactions between intelligently controlled vehicles operating in and around U.S. military facilities, hence the concern,"" Mellon explained.""One: there have been near mid-air collisions so there is a safety issue. Two, there is a vital national security issue which is that our sovereignty is being violated by vehicles of unknown origin,"" he continued.He decided that the only way to make progress was to release this information to the public in the form of his new show, and television interviews.""We are giving military personnel on the front line a voice,"" he said.

36,2,"After more than half a decade, the Affordable Care Act has never become popular in spite of repeated claims from liberal pundits and Democrats that a dramatic shift in opinion was always behind some new horizon. In fact, the law has arguably been a significant drag on the Democratic party for four straight election cycles.

Now as a result, we face the almost unprecedented reality of a major law being repealed. To understand how the law never became popular, we need to only understand the two artificial constraints Obama placed on his signature law back in 2009 which doomed it.

The whole story of the Affordable Care Act is long and complex. Early on, it was unpopular largely because of conservative campaigns against it and a clever Republican strategy to deny the law bipartisan support, making Democrats solely own it. But no amount of negative messaging would have worked in the long run, had the law delivered the results it promised.

The law’s continued lack of support, after being in effect for years, must be attributed to its failure to deliver. And the law failed to deliver because of these two constraints.

The first was Obama’s decision to cut secret deals with healthcare industry CEOs—in other words, his commitment to backing a plan the industry could support. These deals to gain industry backing meant the law couldn’t include the best and most proven ways to reduce health care prices, such as single payer, all payer, a public option, direct price negotiations, etc.

As a result, the law’s “cost control measures” relied on unproven or discredited free market ideas. These measures would supposedly reduce costs for regular people by “increasing their skin in the game” via high deductibles, narrow networks and an individual mandate compelling many people to buy insurance they legitimately couldn’t afford.

Obama’s second fateful decision was to promise the law would be deficit neutral and cost only $1 trillion over a 10-year budget window. This was idiotic on multiple levels. First, the law was only kept under $1 trillion with silly accounting gimmicks that involved Democratic Senators steadily shifting spending to a later date, so the claim had little real credibility. That said, the total amount shouldn’t really matter if it is also deficit neutral overall—the goal should either be to stay below a set amount or be deficit neutral, but having both goals created real confusion with voters.

Despite all of the administration’s accounting maneuvers and its relentless focus on these goals, most Americans ended up believing the law will increase the deficit anyway. Most importantly, this was a terrible decision because there is no way to provide what Obama promised for $1 trillion.

You can’t achieve both goals and get real universal coverage

It would have been possible to provide decent coverage for all of the uninsured for $1 trillion via a single government-run insurance plan, but that would have required real progressive cost controls the industry CEOs opposed. It even would have been possible to give all of the uninsured decent coverage without upsetting the healthcare industry, if Democrats were willing to just throw enough money at it.

Alternatively, you could keep the industry happy and spend only $1 trillion providing decent coverage to only some subgroups of the uninsured. However, you can’t provide decent universal coverage under these two constraints.

Instead of scaling back his promise when this became obvious, Obama thought Democrats could just lie about what the law really does and hope no one would notice. Instead of paying to provide universal, affordable coverage, Democrats merely claimed they created “universal coverage” because they mandated everyone buy coverage, even if they couldn’t really afford it. Not surprisingly, people noticed, as this great article in The Atlantic documents.

For many, the coverage the law provided was not affordable despite the promises. In fact, there are nearly as many people who are paying the individual mandate penalty (8 million) as there are who bought coverage on the Affordable Care Act exchanges (12.7 million). That is a policy disaster. And even among people who did buy coverage on the exchanges, there are a decent number of young or relatively healthy people who have a legitimate reason to feel the law made them worse off, due to increases in premiums/deductibles for plans they can’t afford to use.

This is not to say the law didn’t help anyone. The expansion of Medicaid did truly help many people. But people don’t judge the law by weighing every single plus and minus; they judge it by whether it lived up to its promise, and the Affordable Care Act did not.

There are millions that can make a strong case the Affordable Care Act made them worse off either because they have new “coverage” they can’t afford, saw higher premiums, or are paying a new penalty. You also have millions of people you could argue are better off but legitimately feel betrayed because they did not get what was promised.

Understanding the unpopularity of Obamacare is critical for progressives shaping a response to the Republicans’ eventual “repeal and replace” plan or any other law the newly empowered GOP pushes for. What people care about is whether a law lives up to its promises.

Trump actually made a lot of significant and positive sounding healthcare promises during the campaign to ensure coverage and reduce costs. Democrats should ensure no one forgets these promises. Even though most liberals never believed any of these Trump campaign promises, there are millions of regular voters who did—voters that can be turned against him."

As well as anyone, Sybille Geissler knows the threats from Austria's far-right extremists, who in recent weeks have likened migrants to rats and blithely defended campaign material that evokes Nazi propaganda.For over 12 years, she has led the anti-extremism unit of the domestic intelligence service, and recently testified in a parliamentary inquiry into whether the far right was trying to undermine her agency.Her biggest challenge these days, her testimony suggests, is that the far right is part of her own government.Shortly after the far-right Freedom Party joined the government 17 months ago, taking over the powerful Interior Ministry,The consequences continue to reverberate through the country's politics and beyond, andAcross Europe, nationalist and hard-right parties are ascendant. They dominate the governments of Hungary and Poland, while in Austria, Italy and most recently Estonia, they are junior partners in governing coalitions.In Denmark, the far right exerts influence over the conservative minority government and even in Germany, where the far right remains locked out of power for now, it has risen to become the main opposition party in Parliament and is represented in every state legislature.Where nationalists are in government, they have gravitated toward key portfolios, like the interior ministry, that offer influence over law-and-order issues and immigration.In the case of Austria, that has meant outsize power over the state security apparatus, much of whose mission has long been to monitor threats from neo-Nazis to the country's Constitution.Hints of the same struggle have been evident even in Germany, where the domestic intelligence chief was removed last year over questions of whether he was too sympathetic to the far right to effectively monitor its links to neo-Nazi groups.""What you're seeing in Austria is what we've seen in different corners of Europe - an assault on independent institutions, the separation of powers and the rule of law,"" said Yascha Mounk, an expert on populism and the author of The People vs. Democracy.""The Freedom Party plainly believes that the security apparatus should serve its worldview, and that is dangerous,"" he added. ""It is testing Austria's checks and balances.""In far-right circles, the vaunted day neo-Nazis take power in a putsch is heralded as ""Day X."" For some, like Ms. Geissler, that day is less fantastical than it may seem.""I have to honestly say, since I have been working in the far-right extremism area for a very long time and have a lot of information, my first thought was: This is it, it's Day X,"" she recalled in a parliamentary hearing last year, describing the raid.Indeed,Austrian intelligence officials say the fallout is already being felt.Inside the agency, senior operatives described a situation in which they now find themselves protecting informants and information not only from hostile states -Even European allies and the United States, they say, have begun excluding Austria from certain intelligence sharing,""We think very carefully about what we share with our Austrian partners because we can't be sure where the information will end up,"" one senior European intelligence official said in an interview.Such concerns gained urgency in recent weeks after it emerged that the avowed extremist charged with killing 51 Muslims at two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand, had donated money to the Austrian spokesman of Generation Identity , a far-right youth movement.Austria's young chancellor, Sebastian Kurz , 32, has promised a thorough investigation of any links, financial or inspirational. Yet some wonder whether his government can - or even wants to - carry out that task.Mr. Kurz led his conservative Austrian People's Party to victory in elections in 2017 by giving a youthful and more elegant repackaging to much of the agenda of the far-right Freedom Party, which he then invited into a coalition government. He still depends on their support.The Freedom Party's ties to far-right extremists, including Generation Identity, which is under investigation by several European intelligence services, are well documented. The intelligence service last year compiled a list of 374 members of the movement based on donations, including several active members of the Freedom Party.One recent investigation identified at least 48 Freedom Party politicians or employees with links to Generation Identity. At least four ministries controlled by the Freedom Party, including the Foreign, Defense and Interior Ministries, have employed extremists, according to the investigation by SOS Mitmensch, a nonprofit organization.And their ideas are influencing policy: Last fall, Mr. Kurz unexpectedly withdrew Austria's support for the United Nations pact on migration after Generation Identity activists had campaigned against it.""The march through the institutions appears a lot more deliberate than expected,"" said Christian Strohal, a former Austrian ambassador.Peter Pilz, an opposition lawmaker and a member of the parliamentary inquiry, believes it is a calculated advance. ""They are systematically putting their people in strategic positions,"" he said.Mr. Kurz's fans say that by bringing the far right into government the chancellor is domesticating it. Critics, even in his own camp, contend that he is enabling and sanitizing it.""Sebastian Kurz has made the far right socially acceptable,"" said Reinhold Mitterlehner, a former vice chancellor and fellow conservative.In an interview in his majestic wood-paneled Vienna offices, Mr. Kurz said he stood by his decision to bring the Freedom Party into the government.He rejected the idea that the raid had been politically motivated, though he himself now wants direct reports from the director of intelligence, bypassing his own interior minister.""I believe in our justice system,"" he insisted.He also said the Freedom Party's links to Russia were overstated and that he was satisfied the party was cutting all its ties with Generation Identity. ""I have clearly set out my red line,"" Mr. Kurz said.Just in recent weeks, one Freedom Party official published a poem likening migrants to rats. Another demanded the removal of a television news anchor on Austria's public broadcaster who had challenged him about a campaign poster many saw as reminiscent of Nazi propaganda.In recent days, Mr. Kurz's deputy chancellor, Heinz-Christian Strache, the leader of the Freedom Party and a onetime neo-Nazi, called the notion of ""the great replacement"" of Europeans by migrants a ""reality,"" echoing the flagship conspiracy theory promoted by Generation Identity - and the manifesto of the New Zealand shooter.The raid on the country's own intelligence service in February 2018 took place after it had emerged that a far-right fraternity, co-run by one of the party's rising stars, was using a songbook with brutally anti-Semitic lyrics.The inventory of confiscated material, seen by The New York Times, was long. Officers from a street crime unit led by a Freedom Party ally took everything from personal cellphones to a DVD titled ""Gina Wild - In the Frenzy of Orgasm,"" a pornography film.They also took copies of hard drives, containingIt was not long before Ms. Geissler, the chief of the extremism unit, detected the first signs that Austria was being kept at arm's length by allied agencies.In May of last year, a colleague was disinvited from a European meeting about Generation Identity two hours before he was due to head to the airport.Last September, Ms. Geissler herself attended a meeting and realized that several sessions had taken place without her. ""I asked why we hadn't got the information,"" she recalled for a parliamentary hearing. ""I was told concretely:And last July, Austria was excluded from a Europe-wide tracing request for a Russian diplomat suspected of being a spy.The Freedom Party has a cooperation agreement with President Vladimir V. Putin's United Russia party and last summer, the Freedom Party-backed foreign minister invited Mr. Putin to her wedding Asked in a closed hearing which foreign services had expressed concern that there was a danger of leaks to Russia, Peter Gridling, the head of the intelligence agency, listed them one by one:To avoid formal exclusion, Mr. Gridling has pulled his agency out of all working groups.

38,2,"This remarkable analysis of Srebrenica was written some years ago, but it is as topical now as it was then. In a brief and reasoned overview, all the major issues and dilemmas of the official Srebrenica narrative are set forth. We recommend it warmly to our readers and we invite them to form their own opinion on this complex issue. This was originally published in Counter Punch, October 12, 2005.)

Last summer, almost the entire political spectrum in the Western world joined in a chorus of self-flagellation on the 10th anniversary of the Srebrenica massacre. The dominant theme was “nostra culpa”: “we” let it happen, “we” didn’t want to know about it, and “we” mustn’t let it happen again.

Dear reader, who are “we” in this case? How in the world could “we” (you and I) have known or done anything about this at the time? And in fact, how much do “we” really know about it now? We know what we read in the newspapers or see on television. But how precise and accurate is that information? How do we know now that we are much better informed than we were before the event?

Such questions are virtually taboo. Srebrenica has become a sacred symbol of collective guilt, and to raise the slightest question is to be instantly condemned as an apologist for frightful crimes , or as a “holocaust denier”.

A left that retains any capacity for critical thinking should regard the lavish public breast-beating over “Srebrenica” (the quotation marks indicate the symbol rather than the actual event) with a certain skepticism. If mainstream media commentators and politicians are so extraordinarily moved by “Srebrenica”, this is because it has become an incantation to justify whatever future foreign war the U.S. government and media decide to sell under the label of “humanitarian intervention”.

The Uses of a Massacre

Aside from the probable future use of “Srebrenica”, there is the way it has already been used. Indeed, it was perhaps being used even before it happened.

From the U.N. Secretary General’s 1999 Report on Srebrenica, it emerges that the idea of a “Srebrenica massacre” was already in the air at a September 1993 meeting in Sarajevo between Bosnian Muslim president Alija Izetbegovic and members of his Muslim party from Srebrenica. On the agenda was a Serb proposal to exchange Srebrenica and Zepa for some territories around Sarajevo as part of a peace settlement.

“The delegation opposed the idea, and the subject was not discussed further. Some surviving members of the Srebrenica delegation have stated that President Izetbegovic also told them he had learned that a NATO intervention in Bosnia and Herzegovina was possible, but could only occur if the Serbs were to break into Srebrenica, killing at least 5,000 of its people.” [1]

 Izetbegovic later denied this, but he is outnumbered by witnesses. It is clear that Izetbegovic’s constant strategy was to portray his Muslim side in the bloody civil war as pure helpless victims, in order to bring U.S. military power in on his side. On his death bed, he readily admitted as much to his ardent admirer Bernard Kouchner, in the presence of U.S. diplomat Richard Holbrooke. Kouchner reminded Izetbegovic of a conversation he had had with French President Mitterrand in which he “spoke of the existence of ‘extermination camps’ in Bosnia.”

You repeated that in front of the journalists. That provoked considerable emotion throughout the world. […] They were horrible places, but people were not systematically exterminated. Did you know that?

Yes. I thought that my revelations could precipitate bombings. I saw the reaction of the French and the others-I was mistaken. […] Yes, I tried, but the assertion was false. There were no extermination camps whatever the horror of those places. [2]

Like the Bosnian Serbs, the Muslims also herded their adversaries into “horrible” camps at the start of the civil war, on the way to expulsion. Unlike the Bosnian Serbs, the Bosnian Muslims enjoyed the services of high-powered U.S. public relations experts in the Washington-based Ruder Finn agency who knew how to “spin” the Bosnian conflict in order to equate the Serbs with the Nazis-the quickest and easiest way to win public opinion over to the Muslim side. The news media and political figures were showered with press releases and other materials exaggerating Serb atrocities, whereas Muslim atrocities (such as the decapitations of Serb prisoners, fully documented) remained confidential. To the public, this was a one-sided conflict between a Serbian “fascist aggressor” and innocent victims, all unarmed civilians.

The general public did not know that Srebrenica, described as a “safe area”, was not in fact simply a haven for refugees, but also a Muslim military base. The general public did not know what Lord Owen knew and recounted in his important 1995 book, Balkan Odyssey (p.143), namely that in April 1993, Serbian president Slobodan Milosevic was extremely anxious to prevent Bosnian Serb forces from overrunning Srebrenica. “On 16 April I spoke on the telephone to President Milosevic about my anxiety that, despite repeated assurances from Dr. Karadzic that he had no intention of taking Srebrenica, the Bosnian Serb army was now proceeding to do just that. The pocket was greatly reduced in size. I had rarely heard Milosevic so exasperated, but also so worried: he feared that if the Bosnian Serb troops entered Srebrenica there would be a bloodbath because of the tremendous bad blood that existed between the two armies. The Bosnian Serbs held the young Muslim commander in Srebrenica, Naser Oric, responsible for a massacre near Bratunac in December 1992 in which many Serb civilians had been killed. Milosevic believed it would be a great mistake for the Bosnian Serbs to take Srebrenica and promised to tell Karadzic so.”

Thus, many months before the July 1995 “Srebrenica massacre”, both Izetbegovic and Milosevic were aware of the possibility and of its potential impact-favorable to the Muslim cause, and disastrous for the Serbs. A few other indisputable facts should not be overlooked:

Shortly before the Bosnian Serb attack on Srebrenica, the Muslim troops stationed in that enclave carried out murderous attacks on nearby Serb villages. These attacks were certain to incite Serb commanders to retaliate against the Srebrenica garrison.

Meanwhile, the Muslim high command in Sarajevo ordered the Srebrenica commanders, Oric and his lieutenants, to withdraw from Srebrenica, leaving thousands of his soldiers without commanders, without orders, and in total confusion when the foreseeable Serb attack occurred. Surviving Srebrenica Muslim officials have bitterly accused the Izetbegovic government of deliberately sacrificing them to the interests of his State.

According to the most thorough study of Srebrenica events, by Cees Wiebes for the Netherlands Institute for War Documentation report, the Bosnian Serb forces set out in July 1995 to reduce the area held by Bosnian Muslim forces on the outskirts of Srebrenica, and only decided to capture the town itself when they unexpectedly found it undefended.

“The VRS [Republika Srpska Army] advance went so well that the evening of July 9 saw an important ‘turning point’ […] The Bosnian Serbs decided that they would no longer confine themselves to the southern part of the enclave, but would extend the operation and take the town of Srebrenica itself. Karadzic was informed that the results achieved now put the Drina Corps in a position to take the town; he had expressed his satisfaction with this and had agreed to a continuation of the operation to disarm the ‘Muslim terrorist gangs’ and to achieve a full demilitarization of the enclave. In this order, issued by Major General Zdravko Tolimir, it was also stated that Karadzic had determined that the safety of UNPROFOR soldiers and of the population should be ensured. Orders to this effect were to be provided to all participating units. […] The orders made no mention of a forced relocation of the population. […] A final instruction, also of significance, was that the population and prisoners of war should be treated in accordance with the Geneva Convention. On July 11 all of Srebrenica fell into the hands of the Bosnian Serbs.”

In testimony to a French parliamentary commission inquiry into Srebrenica, General Philippe Morillon, the UNPROFOR officer who first called international attention to the Srebrenica enclave, stated his belief that Bosnian Serb forces had fallen into a “trap” when they decided to capture Srebrenica.

Subsequently, on February 12, 2004, testifying at the International Criminal Tribunal in The Hague, General Morillon stressed that the Muslim commander in Srebrenica, Naser Oric, “engaged in attacks during Orthodox holidays and destroyed villages, massacring all the inhabitants. This created a degree of hatred that was quite extraordinary in the region, and this prompted the region of Bratunac in particular—that is the entire Serb population—to rebel against the very idea that through humanitarian aid one might help the population that was present there.”

Asked by the ICTY prosecutor how Oric treated his Serb prisoners, General Morillon, who knew him well, replied that “Naser Oric was a warlord who reigned by terror in his area and over the population itself. I think that he realized that these were the rules of this horrific war, that he could not allow himself to take prisoners. According to my recollection, he didn’t even look for an excuse. It was simply a statement: One can’t be bothered with prisoners.”

Morillon recounted how “the Serbs took me to a village to show me the evacuation of the bodies of the inhabitants that had been thrown into a hole, a village close to Bratunac. And this made me understand the degree to which this infernal situation of blood and vengeance […] led to a situation when I personally feared that the worst would happen if the Serbs of Bosnia managed to enter the enclaves and Srebrenica.”

“I feared that the Serbs, the local Serbs, the Serbs of Bratunac, these militiamen, they wanted to take their revenge for everything that they attributed to Naser Oric. It wasn’t just Naser Oric that they wanted to revenge, take their revenge on, they wanted to revenge their dead on Orthodox Christmas.”

In short, Srebrenica, whose Serb population had been chased out by Muslim troops at the start of the civil war in 1992, was both a gathering point for civilian Muslim refugees and a Muslim army base. The enclave lived from international humanitarian aid. The Muslim military did not allow civilians to leave, since their presence was what ensured the arrival of humanitarian aid provisions which the military controlled.

When the Bosnian Serb forces captured the town on July 11, 2005, civilians were clamoring to leave the enclave, understandably enough, since there was virtually no normal economic life there. Much has been made of the fact that Serb forces separated the population, providing buses for women, children and the infirm to take them to Tuzla, while detaining the men. In light of all that preceded, the reason for this separation is obvious: the Bosnian Serbs were looking for the perpetrators of raids on Serb villages, in order to take revenge.

However, only a relatively small number of Muslim men were detained at that point, and some of them are known to have survived and eventually been released in exchange for Serb prisoners. When the Serb forces entered the town from the south, thousands of Muslim soldiers, in disarray because of the absence of commanding officers, fled northwards, through wild wooded hills toward Tuzla. It is clear enough that they fled because they feared exactly what everyone aware of the situation dreaded: that Serb soldiers would take vengeance on the men they considered guilty of murdering Serb civilians and prisoners.

Thousands of those men did in fact reach Tuzla, and were quietly redeployed. This was confirmed by international observers. However, Muslim authorities never provided information about these men, preferring to let them be counted among the missing, that is, among the massacred. Another large, unspecified number of these men were ambushed and killed as they fled in scenes of terrible panic. This was, then, a “massacre”, such as occurs in war when fleeing troops are ambushed by superior forces.

So we come to the question of numbers. The question is difficult, both because of the uncertainty that surrounds it, and because merely pointing to this uncertainty is instantly denounced as “revisionism” and lack of respect for the victims. This reproach is not logical. Victims are victims, whether few or many, and respect is not in proportion to their numbers.

 The question of numbers is complex and has been dealt with in detail by others, recently by an independent international Srebrenica research group which will soon publish its findings in book form. [3]

Suffice it here to note the following:

1. The sacralization of the estimated number of victims. In many if not most disasters, initial estimates of casualties tend to be inflated, for various reasons, such as multiple reports of the same missing person, and are subsequently corrected downwards. This was the case for the World Trade Center disaster, where initial estimates of up to 10,000 victims were finally brought down to less than 3000, and there are many other examples. In the case of Srebrenica, the figure of 8,000 originated with September 1995 announcements by the International Committee of the Red Cross that it was seeking information about some 3,000 men reportedly detained as well as about some 5,000 who had fled to central Bosnia. Neither the Bosnian Serbs nor the Muslims were ever forthcoming with whatever information they had, and the “8,000” figure has tended ever since to be repeated as an established total of “Muslim men and boys executed by Serb forces”. It can be noted that this was always an estimate, the sum of two separate groups, the smaller one of prisoners (whose execution would be a clear war crime) and the larger one of retreating troops (whose “massacre” as they fled would be the usual tragic consequence of bitter civil war). Anyone familiar with the workings of journalism knows that there is a sort of professional inertia which leads reporters to repeat whatever figure they find in previous reports, without verification, and with a marked preference for big numbers. This inertia is all the greater when no truly authoritative figures ever emerge.

Despite unprecedented efforts over the past ten years to recover bodies from the area around Srebrenica, less than 3,000 have been exhumed, and these include soldiers and others-Serb as well as Muslim-who died in the vicious combats that took place during three years of war. Only a fraction have been identified.

2. The political desire for the largest possible number. Aside from the journalistic inertia mentioned above, the retention of the unproven high figure of massacre victims in the case of Srebrenica is clearly the result of political will on the part of two governments: the Bosnian Muslim government of Alija Izetbegovic and, more importantly, the government of the United States. From the moment that Madeleine Albright brandished satellite photos of what she claimed was evidence of Serb massacres committed at Srebrenica (evidence that was both secret, as the photos were shown in closed session to the Security Council, and circumstantial, as they showed changes in terrain which might indicate massacres, not the alleged massacres themselves), the U.S. used “Srebrenica” for two clear purposes:

To draw attention away from the U.S.-backed Croatian offensive which drove the Serb population out of the Krajina which, as much as Srebrenica, was supposed to be protected by the United Nations; to implicate Bosnian Serb leaders in “genocide” in order to disqualify them from negotiating the future of Bosnia-Herzegovina. (The U.S. preferred to replace them at Dayton by Milosevic, whose eagerness to end the war could be exploited to get concessions the Bosnian Serbs might refuse.)

Exploitation of “Srebrenica” then helped set the stage for the Kosovo war of 1999: by blaming the United Nations (whose failure to defend Srebrenica was in reality the inevitable result of the unwillingness of the United States to give full support to U.N. ground forces), NATO emerged as the only agent capable of effective “humanitarian intervention”.

by falsely identifying Milosevic with the Bosnian Serb leadership and by exploiting the notion that Srebrenica killings were part of a vast Serb plan of “genocide” carried out against non-Serbs for purely racist reasons, Madeleine Albright was able to advocate the NATO war against Yugoslavia as necessary to prevent “another Srebrenica” in Kosovo, where the situation was altogether different.

To use “Srebrenica” as an effective instrument in the restructuring of former Yugoslavia, notably by replacing recalcitrant Serb leaders by more pliable politicians, the crime needed to be as big as possible: not a mere war crime (such as the United States itself commits on a serial basis, from Vietnam to Panama to Iraq), but “genocide”: “the worst atrocity in Europe since the Holocaust”. That arouses the Hitler image, which is always good for the image of the United States as saviour from across the seas, and implies a plan decided at the highest levels, rather than the brutal behavior of enraged soldiers (or paramilitaries, the probable culprits in this case) out of control.

But what plan for genocide includes offering safe passage to women and children? And if this was all part of a Serb plot to eliminate Muslims, what about all the Muslims living peacefully in Serbia itself, including thousands of refugees who fled there from Bosnia? Or the Muslims in the neighboring enclave of Zepa, who were unharmed when the Serbs captured that town a few days after capturing Srebrenica? To get around these common sense obstacles, the ICTY prosecution came up with a sociologist who provided an “expert” opinion: the Srebrenica Muslims lived in a patriarchal society, therefore killing the men was enough to ensure that there would be no more Muslims in Srebrenica. This amounts to shrinking the concept of “genocide” to fit the circumstances.

It was on basis of this definition that in August 2001 the Tribunal found Bosnian Serb General Radislav Krstic guilty of “complicity in genocide”. Although he neither ordered, participated in or was even aware of any executions, the judges ruled that he took part in what the ICTY calls a “joint criminal enterprise” simply by capturing Srebrenica, since he must have been aware that genocide was “a natural and foreseeable consequence”. This is the ruling that established “genocide” as the official description of events at Srebrenica.

Why such relentless determination to establish Srebrenica as “genocide”? A December 27, 2003, Associated Press dispatch provided an explanation by U.S. jurist Michael Scharf, one of the designers of the ICTY who has also coached the judges for the trial of Saddam Hussein: On a practical level, if the court determines Srebrenica does not fit the legal definition of genocide, it would be very difficult to make the charge stick against Milosevic, said Michael Scharf, a professor at Case Western Reserve University School of Law.

 “And it is crucial that he be convicted of genocide,” Scharf said. If Milosevic can’t be convicted, “then who can you convict of genocide in the modern age?” he asked.

The legal definition of genocide could also come into play in an Iraqi war-crimes tribunal, which has vowed to follow international legal precedent.

It is striking that from the very start, the effort of the United States and of the Tribunal in The Hague-which it mainly finances, staffs and controls-has been to establish what it calls “command responsibility” for Serb crimes rather than individual guilt of actual perpetrators. The aim is not to identify and punish men who violated the Geneva conventions by executing prisoners, but rather to pin the supreme crime on the top Serb leadership.

The office of the ICTY prosecutor has chosen to rely heavily on a single confessed participant in the Srebrenica massacre. This person is one Drazen Erdemovic, a petty criminal of Croatian nationality who was hospitalized in Serbia in March 1996 after a near-fatal brawl in a bar in Novi Sad. Quite possibly in order to escape further threats from his personal enemies, Erdemovic confessed to Western news media to having taken part in mass murder in Bosnia. He was arrested by Serb authorities who then, at his request, turned him over to the Hague Tribunal.

From then on, the prosecution has used Erdemovic repeatedly as its star witness, using the U.S. procedure of “plea bargaining” by which a confessed criminal gets off lightly by incriminating somebody else the prosecution wants to convict. He has told his story to the judges at his own brief trial, where he was exempted from cross examination thanks to his guilty plea, as well as at a hearing incriminating Karadzic and Mladic (in the absence of any legal defense) and at various trials whenever “Srebrenica” comes up.

His story goes like this: after briefly serving in the Bosnian Muslim army, Erdemovic joined an international mercenary militia unit that seems to have been employed by the Bosnian Serb command for sabotage operations on enemy territory. On July 16, 1995, his unit of eight men executed between 1,000 and 1,200 Muslim men near the village of Pilice, some 40 kilometers north of Srebrenica. From around 10:30 in the morning to 3 o’clock in the afternoon, these eight mercenaries emptied bus load after bus load of prisoners and lined them up to be shot by groups of ten.

Now in fact, it seems that a serious crime was indeed committed in Pilice. Subsequent forensic investigators exhumed 153 bodies. One hundred and fifty-three executions of prisoners of war is a serious crime, and there is material evidence that this crime was committed. But 1,200? According to the manner of execution described by Erdemovic, it would have taken 20 hours to murder so many victims. Yet the judges have never questioned this elementary arithmetical discrepancy, and Erdemovic’s word has consistently been accepted as gospel truth by the International Criminal Tribunal in The Hague. [4]

Why this insistence on an implausibly higher number than can be supported by material evidence? Obviously, the Tribunal wants to keep the figures as high as possible in order to sustain the charge of “genocide”. The charge of “genocide” is what sharply distinguishes the indictment of Serbs from indictments of Croats or Muslims for similar crimes committed during the Yugoslav disintegration wars.

In August 2000 after not quite four and a half years in jail, the self-confessed mass murderer Erdemovic was freed, given a new identity, residence in an unspecified Western country and a “job”, so to speak, as occasional paid and “protected” witness for the ICTY.

In contrast, General Krstic was sentenced to 35 years in prison and will be eligible for parole in 20 years.

Clearly, the purpose of the “genocide” charge is not to punish the perpetrators but to incriminate the Bosnian Serb, and the Yugoslav Serb, chain of command right up to the top.

The transformation of Srebrenica into myth was illustrated last July by an article in the Italian leftist daily Liberazione [5] (close to the “Communist Refoundation” party) reporting on a semi-documentary film entitled “Srebrenica, luci dall’oblio” (“Srebrenica, lights from oblivion”). The title suggests that the film-makers have rescued from oblivion a tragically neglected event, when in fact, rarely in the history of warfare has a massacre been the focus of so much attention.

Here we have the usual self-flagellation: “…what happened in Srebrenica: the massacre of 9,000 civilians, in the most total silence/absence on the part of the world institutions [responsible for] peace…” The author accepts without question the term “genocide” and raises the figure of victims to new heights. “Around 9,000 men between the ages of 14 and 70 were transported by truck to nearby centers where they were massacred and buried in mass graves…” This was “the greatest mass genocide committed since the days of Nazism until today”… What is the point of this exaggeration, this dramatization? Why is Srebrenica so much more terrible than the war that ravaged Vietnam, with countless massacres and devastation of the countryside by deadly chemicals, or the cold-blooded massacre of surrendering Iraqis at the end of the first Gulf War in 1991? But that is a genuinely forgotten massacre-not only forgotten, but never even recognized in the first place, and the “international community” has not sent teams of forensic scientists to find and identify the victims of U.S. weapons.

In all probability the film-makers, aspiring artists and “genocide experts” who consider “Srebrenica” suitable material for touching the emotions of the public believe that they are serving the interests of peace and humanity. But I would suggest quite the contrary. The misrepresentation of “Bosnia” as scene of a deliberate “genocide” against Muslims, rather than a civil war with atrocities on all sides, contributes to a spirit of “conflict of civilizations”. It has helped recruit volunteers for Islamic terrorist groups.

The political exploitation of Srebrenica has turned the Bosnian war into a morality pantomime between pure good and pure evil, a version of events which the Serbs can never really accept and the Muslims have no desire to give up. This stands in the way of unbiased investigation and serious historical analysis. Reconciliation is in fact ruled out by the moralistic insistence that a stark distinction must be made between “aggressor” and “victim”. This stark difference exists between NATO and Yugoslavia, or between the U.S. and Iraq, where an overwhelmingly superior military power deliberately launched an aggressive war against a sovereign country that neither attacked nor threatened it.

But the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina was not of that nature. The war there was the result of an extraordinarily complex legal situation (an unsettled small Federal Republic constitutionally composed of three “nationalities”: Serb, Muslim and Croat, itself part of a disintegrating larger Federal Republic) exacerbated by myriad local power plays and the incoherent intervention of Great Powers. Moreover, this occurred in a region where memories of extremely bloody civil war during World War II were still very much alive. To a large extent, the fighting that broke loose in 1992 was a resumption of the vicious cycle of massacres and vengeance that devastated Bosnia-Herzegovina in 1941-44, when the Nazi occupation broke up Yugoslavia and attached Bosnia-Herzegovina to Greater Croatia, which proceeded to eliminate Serbs.

Today it is an unquestioned dogma that recalling atrocities is a “duty of memory” to the victims, something that must be endlessly repeated, lest we forget. But is this really so obvious? The insistence on past atrocities may simply prepare the next wave, which is what has already happened in the Balkans, and more than once. Because in reality, the dead victims cannot profit from such memories. But the memory of victimhood is a moral and political capital of great value for the heirs of victimhood and especially for their self-appointed champions. And in the case of Bosnia, it promises to bring considerable financial gain. If Milosevic, as former president of Serbia, can be convicted of genocide, then the Bosnian Muslims hope to win billions of dollars in reparations that will keep Serbia on its knees for the foreseeable future.

The obsessive reference to “Srebrenica” has a negative effect far beyond the Balkans. The “Srebrenica massacre” is part of a dominant culture discourse that goes like this: We people in the advanced democracies have reached a new moral plateau, from which we are both able and have a duty both to judge others and to impose our “values” when necessary. The others, on a lower moral plateau, must be watched carefully, because unlike us, they may commit “genocide”. It is remarkable how “genocide” has become fashionable, with more and more “genocide experts” in universities, as if studying genocide made sense as a separate academic discipline. What would all these people do without genocide? I wonder what is behind the contemporary fascination with genocide and serial killers, and I doubt that it is a sign of a healthy social psychology.

In the world today, few people, including Bosnian Muslims, are threatened by “genocide” in the sense of a deliberate Hitler-style project to exterminate a population-which is how most people understand the term. But millions of people are threatened, not by genocidal maniacs, but by genocidal conditions of life: poverty, disease, inadequate water, global climate change. The Srebrenica mourning cult offers nothing positive in regard to these genocidal conditions. Worse, it is instrumentalized openly to justify what is perhaps the worst of all the genocidal conditions: war.

The subliminal message in the official Srebrenica discourse is that because “we” let that happen, “we” mustn’t let “it” happen again, ergo, the United States should preventively bomb potential perpetrators of “genocide”. Whatever happened in Srebrenica could have best been prevented, not by U.S. or NATO bombing, but by preventing civil war from breaking out in Bosnia Herzegovina to begin with. This prevention was possible if the “international community”, meaning the NATO powers, Europe and the United States, had firmly insisted that the Yugoslav crisis of 1990 should be settled by negotiations. But first of all, Germany opposed this, by bullying the European Union into immediate recognition of the secession of Slovenia and Croatia from Yugoslavia, without negotiation. All informed persons knew that this threatened the existence of Bosnia Herzegovina. The European Union proposed a cantonization plan for Bosnia Herzegovina, not very different from the present arrangement, which was accepted by leaders of the Bosnian Muslim, Serb and Croat communities. But shortly thereafter, Muslim president Alija Izetbegovic reneged, after the U.S. ambassador encouraged him to hold out for more. Throughout the subsequent fighting, the U.S. put obstacles in the way of every European peace plan. [6] These years of obstruction enabled the United States to take control of the eventual peace settlement in Dayton, in November 1995.

This rejection of compromise, which plunged Bosnia-Herzegovina into fratricidal war, was supported at the time by a chorus of humanitarians- not least politicians safely ensconced in the European Parliament who voted for “urgent resolutions” about situations of which they were totally ignorant-claiming that Bosnia must be a centralized State for the sake of “multiculturalism”. These were the same humanitarians who applauded the breakup of multicultural Yugoslavia-which in fact created the crisis in Bosnia.

Clearly, whoever executes unarmed prisoners commits a very serious crime whether in Bosnia or anywhere else. But when all is said and done, it is an illusion to think that condemning perpetrators of a massacre in Bosnia will ensure that the next civil war somewhere in the world will be carried out in a more chivalrous manner. War is a life and death matter, and inevitably leads people to commit acts they would never commit in peacetime.

The notion that war can be made “clean”, played according to rules, should not be the main focus of international law or of peace movements. War first of all needs to be prevented, not policed.

The false interpretation of “Srebrenica” as part of an ongoing Serb project of “genocide” was used to incite the NATO war against Yugoslavia, which devastated a country and left behind a cauldron of hatred and ethnic cleansing in Kosovo. The United States is currently engaged in a far more murderous and destructive war in Iraq. In this context, the Western lamentations that inflate the Srebrenic massacre into “the greatest mass genocide since Nazi times” are a diversion from the real existing genocide, which is not the work of some racist maniac, but the ongoing imposition of a radically unjust socio-economic world order euphemistically called “globalization”.

39,2,"Oklahoma Teachers Plan Strike For April If Lawmakers Do Not Increase Pay

Oklahoma schools will shut down indefinitely on April 2 if state legislators do not pass legislation that increases funding for education, including $10,000 for teachers over the next three years, the Oklahoma Education Association (OEA) announced on March 7th.

The move follows decades of frustration among Oklahoma educators, which largely stems from low pay. If a strike occurs, it will be the first in the state since 1990.

“The major issues we have that hurt us are class sizes and being able to recruit and retain qualified teachers,” said Deven McMahan, a third-grade teacher at Walt Whitman Elementary School and a union representative of the Tulsa Classroom Teachers Association (TCTA).

Some of the classrooms in her district have more than 28 students in them following a loophole state legislators found to a cap on class sizes, according to McMahan.

The state’s ability to recruit and retain teachers is hampered by the fact that teachers in Oklahoma are paid less than in any other state in the country. In fact, many Oklahoma teachers make thousands of dollars less each year than assistant managers at gas stations, according to CNBC reporting, despite the years of education and training usually necessary to become an educator.

“We earn $15,000 a year less than [teachers in] Texas. We earn $12,000 a year less than [teachers in] Arkansas,” said Larry Cagle, an English teacher at Edison Preparatory High School who believes there’s “absolutely no excuse for that kind of compensation” disparity.

Cagle added, “The pay increase we received over a decade ago was snatched away by jacking up our health insurance, so essentially we’ve gone nearly 15 years without a raise.”

As a result of their low wages, Cagle said teachers are leaving the state in droves to find work elsewhere.

Oklahoma teachers, like teachers in Arizona, are inspired by a successful teacher strike in West Virginia earlier this year.

“[West Virginia] wasn’t as bad off as we are, and they still felt the need for it to be done,” suggested McMahan, noting that she thought the success in West Virginia “gave everyone more hope, rather than the constant feeling of defeat.”

To solve the crisis, the OEA is pushing state legislators to adopt a plan that would increase educator’s pay, the pay of education support professionals, invest $200 million in education funding, and increase funding for state services for healthcare and public safety. The plan, known as the “Together We’re Stronger” plan on their website, comes with a price tag of roughly $1.4 billion.

Uncertainty about where these funds should come from remains an obstacle to solving the issue. On March 14, the state Senate failed to pass a bill that would give teachers a nearly 13 percent raise by increasing taxes on cigarettes, motor fuel, and oil and natural gas production.

The offices of Oklahoma Senators John Sparks (D-16) and Greg Treat (R-47), respectively, were asked for comments but did not respond by the time of publication.

For weeks, the OEA and various teachers groups have used smaller-scale tactics to grab the community’s attention.

Oklahoma superintendents encouraged teachers to only work their contracted hours prior to the strike – a work-to-rule tactic in labor – meant to show how much work teachers do relative to their minor pay. Many teachers are not happy with the idea, however.

“It’s difficult because we do 75 percent of our work outside of contract hours,” McMahan said, referring to the hundreds of hours a year spent grading, lesson planning, and calling parents beyond school hours.

Despite the tactic making it harder for teachers to do their job, McMahan believes her superintendent encouraged the move as a way to show legislators that teachers had taken steps to get their attention before shutting down schools.

On the other hand, Cagle called the strategy “ridiculous” and “embarrassing” and argued it would never elicit the raise teachers desperately needed.

As a founding member of Oklahoma Teachers Union (OTU), Cagle has worked for a year to push for a statewide strike and make parents aware of the problems teachers face. He helped organize teachers to call in sick in groups to delay classes. He held strategy meetings with other educators and encouraged students to have walkouts in supports of raising teachers’ pay. These walkouts have often drawn local media attention.

These difference of tactics weren’t the only disagreement between teachers and their statewide union.

Originally, the OEA met with 200 Oklahoma superintendents and declared that schools would be suspended after April 23 if the additional funding was not provided, but the date was moved up due to pushback from self-organized teachers groups that were determined to walk out sooner.

Hours after deleting their original post from social media, the OEA acknowledged the frustration of teachers who thought their approach wasn’t quick enough.

“We hear you. We are putting together more information for you about the strategic reasoning of proposed school closure dates. We all have the same goal: pay raises for education employees and fully funded education,” the OEA stated on Facebook.

Representatives from the OEA did not respond to requests for comment by the time of publication.

Despite disagreements, it seems there is a desire for the strike in Oklahoma, according to a survey the OEA had community members fill out.

Of the more than 10,000 educators, students, parents, and others that answered the survey, nearly 80 percent supported school closures as a tactic to force legislatures to invest more in public education. No group had less than 75 percent support.

The suspension of schools across the state in April when state testing would occur represents a last-ditch effort by educators in the state to force the legislature’s collective hand."

42,2,"It really is true: the bastion of Liberalism is seeking a makeover. Not only have there been a slew of books about socialism and social-democracy of late, but a slew of social-democrats have actually broken the congressional glass ceiling. (I’ve been unable to establish exactly how many DSA members were elected in 2018, along with Alexandra Ocasio-Cortes, who became instantly famous, because on-line searches only bring up articles warning of the dangers of socialism rather than a list of democratic socialists in Congress!)

And yet, as the US begins to tear down a century-long opprobrium, hardly a day goes by that some well-known writer comes up with a new book cautiously introducing Americans to the idea that democratic socialism is necessary to overcome America’s profound crisis. Led by well-known economist Joseph Stiglitz’s People, Power, and Profits: Progressive Capitalism for an Age of Discontent, there is a scramble to save what can be saved of a capitalism gone wild.

In The Algebra of Happiness, Scott Galloway attempts to convince us that if we are unhappy, it can’t be liberalism’s fault; it’s that Happiness equals meaningful relationships. This theme is also illustrated by Adam Gopnik’s personalized defense of Liberalism in The New Yorker, which represents the epitome of sophistication, however, it is torn to shreds in The New Republic, under apt the title: The Emptiness of Adam Gopnik’s Liberalism. David Sessions accuses Gopnik of lacking a fundamental understanding of political-economic power: “The left-wing critique of liberalism is chiefly an attack on liberal faith in reform. Gopnik claims that ‘even when legislative institutions are very unequal and even undemocratic, as long as formal freedoms can be respected… it’s possible to force reforms even when they come reluctantly’, whereas the problem with liberalism is not its ideals but its permanent inability to achieve them.”

Sessions claims that ”only revolutionary change can bring justice and equality to a criminally unjust world,” adding a sardonic: “Liberalism “doesn’t just export its atrocities; it exports its exploitations and then brings back the profits to support the supposedly liberal arts.”

Meanwhile, like a breath of fresh air, in the June Harpers, Marilynne Robinson, a prize winning essayist and novelist who is fascinated by the relationship between science and religion, asks “Is Poverty Necessary?”, responding with a primer on the work of the nineteenth century American economist, Henry George who has recently been experiencing a revival. “Georgism” contends that people should own the value they produce, while the economic value derived from land and natural resources should belong to all members of society, its value taxed away by the state. (Among George’s contemporary admirers were Tolstoy and Einstein, signaling the chasm between the nineteenth and twenty-first centuries zeitgeist.)

As the Trump presidency continues to illustrate the failings of representative democracy, while assuring voters that the United States of America will never become socialist, pundits despair of neo-liberal capitalism’s future. Some are even turning to American history, with one pundit even claiming that it shows that “division is written into our DNA”. That message is expounded in a book entitled ‘The British are Coming!’, which reassures readers of the unique ‘can-do’ American character in a popular style. Pundits discussing the book stress its relevance to the current crisis, some advocating more social studies classes that glorify bravery, to prepare high school students to fight Iran. Showing real panic, Chris Matthews warned that ‘Iran is a real country, not something created by the British on a map’, while the Europeans, whom we tout as allies, but who have been our minions for decades, appear to be finally getting up the courage to tell Washington to ‘get lost’, three European allies pulling its ship out of the Persian Gulf convoy.

Caught between Trump’s threat to abortion rights and that of war, American voters are increasingly turning to a seventy-six year old Senator who unsuccessfully sought the Democratic presidential nomination in 1988 and in 2008. Joe Biden was Obama’s Vice President and appeals mainly to older Democrats, however, since hinting that he would run, he has systematically topped the charts, among a field of lesser known and/or much younger candidates. The most recent established figure to announce an intention to run is the less-than-popular Mayor of New York, Bill de Blasio, an avowed social democrat whose wife is Black and whom many New Yorkers find haughty. As for the press, it will continue to imply that any label with the word socialism is bad until it gets recognition from on high that only democratic socialism, which protects the weak while allowing the strong to innovate, can save capitalism from itself.

43,2,"Today, however, many of the children and grandchildren of those who marched half a century ago find themselves in a debate over the role of words like “Chicano” in the fight for rights in the age of Trump.

The uproar began in March, when leaders of MEChA — Movimiento Estudiantil Chicano de Aztlán, founded as a national Mexican American student group after the blowouts — voted 29 to 3 to drop any trace of the word “Chicano.”

They also supported removing “Aztlán,” the name of the mythical ancestral home of the Aztecs in what is now the U.S. Southwest.

Supporters of the change said the two words were too Mexican-centric and excluded the LGBTQ population, non-Mexican Latinos, indigenous people and other groups. In a statement days later, the group used gender-neutral terms like “Mestizx” (for mestizo), reflecting just how much the student organization had evolved.

In the late 1960s, the Latino civil rights movement was fueled mostly by the American-born children of Mexican immigrants.

MEChA was at the forefront of the struggle, pushing for the establishment of Chicano and ethnic studies programs across the country.

Though people of Mexican origin still make up the majority of Latinos in the U.S., immigration from that country has slowed, according to a Pew Research Center analysis. Meanwhile, the number of immigrants from El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras has risen.

The name change won’t take effect until MEChA representatives meet again next year to vote on an alternative.

But within days of the decision, San Diego State’s MEChA chapter separated from the national body. In a statement, UCLA’s chapter announced it also was seceding from the national organization and would keep “Chicanx” and “Aztlán” in its name.

“What happened is tantamount to me going to a Black Lives Matter organization and complaining that they’re xenophobic and racist because they don’t talk about brown lives and that they should change their name to All Lives Matter,” said Adrian Alvarez, 56, who joined MEChA while at UCLA in the 1980s. He’s now an activist with Unión del Barrio, a national human rights organization headquartered in San Diego.

MEChA isn’t the only Latino organization to wrestle with changing its name along with the times.

Students at Columbia University are petitioning to rename its “Raza Grad,” a ceremony honoring students of Latin American descent, to something more inclusive. In 2017, the National Council of La Raza became UnidosUS in an effort to attract millennials — after years of defending itself against critics who decried the term “la raza,” which literally translates to “the race” but more accurately means “the people.”

Over the years, many have accused MEChA, La Raza and their siblings of being anti-white and dedicated to racial separatism.

But the whole reason MEChA was created was “to make sure we don’t lose those connections” to the Mexican community, said Irene Monica Sanchez, 36, a professor at Bard College in Los Angeles who also teaches high school Chicano and Latino studies.

In 1969, students drafted the organization’s manifesto and declared that MEChA would be the student branch of the Chicano movement, so that young Mexican Americans could be themselves, learn their history and embrace their culture.

To many students of Central American descent, however, the change is long overdue.

The focus of the group’s leaders on Mexican issues and culture, the 23-year-old said, “just bled into every aspect of the club, whether it’s how things were run … what kind of food they have at the event, what kind of music they played.”"
45,2,"It looks like 2019 could be the worst year for U.S. agriculture in modern American history by a very wide margin. As you will see below, millions upon millions of acres of U.S. farmland will go unused this year due to cataclysmic flooding. And many of the farmers that did manage to plant crops are reporting extremely disappointing results. The 12 month period that concluded at the end of April was the wettest 12 month period in U.S. history, and more storms just kept on coming throughout the month of May. And now forecasters are warning of another series of storms this week, and following that it looks like a tropical storm will pummel the region. As Bloomberg has pointed out, we have truly never seen a year like this ever before…

Many farmers just kept waiting for the flooding and the rain to end so that they could plant their crops, but that didn’t happen.

At this point it is too late for many farmers to plant crops at all, and it is now being projected that 6 million acres of farmland that is usually used for corn will go completely unsown this year…

And we could actually see even more soybean acres go unplanted, because the latest crop progress report shows that soybean planting is even further behind…

The Crop Progress indicated just 67% of corn was planted in 18 key corn-producing states. The 2014-18 average for corn planted by June 2nd is 96%, so planting is off 30.2% in comparison. Corn planting has been at an all-time low percentage for the last three reports and remains behind schedule in 17 of the 18 states monitored. Soybean planting is behind in 16 of the 18 key soybean-producing states, according to the report. So far, just 39% of soybean planting has taken place, compared to the five-year average of 79% by June 2nd, meaning soybean planting is off 50.6%.

In the end, we could easily see more than 10 million acres of U.S. farmland go completely unused this year.

And please don’t assume that the acres that have been planted are going to be okay. In Nebraska, farmer Ed Brummels said that conditions are so bad that it is “like we are trying to plant on top of a lake!”…

When you plant fields that are absolutely saturated with water, the results can be extremely disappointing, and that is what we are hearing all over the nation.

Here is just one example…

Farmers in the middle of the country desperately need things to dry out for an extended period of time.

But that is not going to happen any time soon.

In fact, meteorologists are telling us that more storms are going to hammer the middle of the country over the next few days…

The situation does not look to improve for farmers in the U.S. Corn Belt. AccuWeather is predicting the pattern of rounds of showers and thunderstorms to continue, with storms over part of the flood-stricken areas into midweek. Also, the southern half of the Corn Belt is in the path of downpours expected later this week. “If you’re along the Ohio River and you don’t have your corn planted by Wednesday, you may not plant anything additional because you may get three inches of rain between Thursday and Saturday,” said AccuWeather senior meteorologist Jason Nicholls.

Sadly, some areas could see “up to 5 inches of rain”, and needless to say that could be absolutely devastating for many farmers.

And then after that, a weather system that could soon be named “Tropical Storm Barry” is likely to move into the region…

2019 is turning out to be a “perfect storm” for U.S. farmers, and many of them will never recover from this.

Meanwhile, flooding continues to intensify along the major rivers in the middle of the country. According to Missouri Governor Mike Parson, almost 400 roads have now been closed in his state…

This flooding has been going on for months, and there is no end in sight.

In recent days, multiple levees in the state of Missouri have been breached, and a number of small towns are now totally under water…

This is a nightmare that never seems to end, but many Americans living on both coasts don’t seem to be taking this disaster very seriously.

But they should be taking it seriously because if farmers don’t grow our food, we don’t eat.

The food that we are eating right now is from past production. The crops that are being grown now represent food that we will be eating in the future, and right now it looks like a whole lot less food will be produced than we expected.

That means that food prices will start going up, and they will probably keep going up for the foreseeable future.

We are moving into extremely uncertain times, but most Americans don’t seem to understand this yet.

For a very long time we have been able to take stability for granted, but now everything is starting to change. Those that are wise will be able to adapt to the changing conditions, but unfortunately it appears that most Americans believe that there is simply nothing to be concerned about.

48,2,"The Limits Of The Fed’s “Financial Engineering” Have Been Reached

Decisions to change official rates can no longer be made exclusively on economic growth and price considerations as the dynamics of business cycles have changed.

The new business cycle consists of growth and financial leverage (debt), replacing the old cycle of growth and price leverage.

As such, decisions to provide more monetary accommodations to sustain growth or lift inflation to the preferred target has to be weighed against growing financial vulnerabilities associated with the sharp rise in private sector debt. Promises by policymakers to provide additional monetary accommodation to sustain the growth cycle is more likely to do more long-term harm than good as it will only increase the scale of financial vulnerabilities.

In recent decades, monetary policy through its adjustments and control of short-term interest rates has had more influence on financial transactions than economic ones as individuals and nonfinancial corporations have engaged in active management of the liability side of their balance sheet, taking on record amounts of debt at relatively low rates, elevating real and financial asset prices in the process, while providing only modest benefits to overall economy.

For example, since 2011 nonfinancial corporations have added to $5.2 trillion in debt to their balance sheets. Corporations used this debt for a variety of purposes, such as acquiring other companies, purchasing real estate, buying back their own stock, while also investing in plant and equipment to run their regular business operations. Yet, the incremental growth in nonresidential investment has been a little more than $1 trillion. In other words, for every $5 borrowed by nonfinancial corporations only $1 has found itself redeployed in the real economy.

In the 2000s cycle, households also went on a borrowing binge, adding over $7 trillion in new debt over the span of seven years. Most of the new debt was invested in real estate. Over the course of the 2000’s growth cycle households added $2 of debt for every $1 increase in consumer spending and investment in housing. Much higher ratios of debt to new investment occurred during the dot.com boom of the late 1990s and the the commercial real estate boom of the late 1980s.

All of these episodes highlight the new linkages and tradeoffs between monetary policy and financial activities. Yet, the failure to adapt, and even recognize, the changing linkages caused policymakers to miss, or downplay, the buildup of financial vulnerabilities in the system and the adverse shocks to the economy and the financial system were repeated time and again.

Each period of excessive credit and financial leverage was followed by a long bout of debt-deleveraging forcing the Fed to engage in a “financial engineering” campaign to cushion the economy and bring stability to the financial system. Following the commercial real estate crash of the early 1990s the Federal Reserve lowered official rates 650 basis points; 550 basis points following the dot-com bubble; and 500 basis points (and probably an extra 200 basis points of easing occurred with the Fed’s asset purchase program) after the housing bubble.

Today, even though the current environment has similar characteristics—large increases in debt and elevated asset prices–that preceded each of the past three recessions policymakers do not seem to be concerned about the growing buildup of financial vulnerabilities. Yet, the financial markets with Treasury yields out to 10 years trading well below the target on the federal funds rate suggests that the limits of the Fed’s “financial engineering” have been reached and additional monetary accommodation will have a negative trade-off between costs and benefits.

In fact, it would not be a surprise if market yields stay near current levels even if the Fed decides to lower official rates since encouraging more debt growth would only tip the scale more so to a bad outcome down the road.

I assume there is a special place in the gulag for this pipsqueak imposter. The audacity of accusing AOC of having to count on her fingers to do simple math - while forgetting that AOC has to remember that she has fingers first!

Perhaps she is truly emulating the wise AOC and is attempting to use the same finger-wiggles and hand-waves that AOC uses between brilliant observations in order to give not-so-brilliant deplorables time to prepare themselves for wisdom. 



Or then again, perhaps she is a pipsqueak imposter. Whatever the Party decides is and has always been my feeling.

57,2,"HONG KONG (Reuters) - Hong Kong was plunged into a fresh political crisis on Sunday night after more than half a million people took to the streets to thwart a proposed extradition law that would allow suspects to be sent to mainland China to face trial.

Organisers said the turnout outstripped a demonstration in 2003 when 500,000 hit the streets to challenge government plans for tighter national security laws.

Those laws were later shelved and a key government official forced to resign. Sunday’s outpouring was already raising the pressure on the administration of Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam and her official backers in Beijing.

“She has to withdraw the bill and resign,” veteran Democratic Party lawmaker James To told crowds outside the city’s parliament and government headquarters on Sunday night.

“The whole of Hong Kong is against her.”

After To spoke, thousands were still arriving, having started the march five hours earlier, filling four lanes of a major thoroughfare. Some sat in a nearby park singing “Hallelujah” while police increased their numbers around the area.

Lam had yet to comment on the rally. The demonstration capped weeks of growing outrage in the business, diplomatic and legal communities, which fear corrosion of Hong Kong’s legal autonomy and the difficulty of ensuring basic judicial protections in mainland China.

The protest descended into violence in the early hours of Monday as several hundred protesters clashed with a similar number of police outside the city’s parliament. [L4N23G0D8]

Protesters charged police lines to try to force their way into the Legislative Council building, and police charged back, using pepper spray, after warning the protesters. The standoff ended in the early hours of Monday.

U.S. and European officials have issued formal warnings - concern matched by international business and human rights lobbies that fear the changes would dent Hong Kong’s rule of law. The former British colony was handed back to Chinese rule in 1997 amid guarantees of autonomy and various freedoms including a separate legal system, which many diplomats and business leaders believe is the city’s strongest remaining asset.

The unusually broad opposition to the rendition bill displayed on Sunday came amid a series of government moves to deepen links between southern mainland China and Hong Kong.

Police had yet to issue their own estimate of the protest size. But as tens of thousands reached the Legislative Council in the Admiralty business district, the starting point in Victoria Park was crowded with thousands more still waiting to join the march.

Some carried yellow umbrellas - a symbol of the pro-democracy Occupy protests that choked key city streets for 79 days in 2014.

Streets were packed along the route. Reuters witnesses at various key points estimated the crowd at several hundred thousand.

Chants of “No China extradition, no evil law” echoed through the city streets, while other marchers called for Lam and other senior officials to step down.

One protester held a sign reading: “Carry off Carrie”, while another declared: “Extradite yourself, Carrie”. Another sign said: “Let’s make Hong Kong great again”, with a photo depicting U.S. President Donald Trump firing Lam.

The genial crowd included young families pushing babies in prams as well as the elderly braving 32-degree C (90 F) heat, some spraying each other with water misters.

Debates will start in the council on Wednesday on the amendments to the Fugitive Offenders Ordinance. The bill could be passed into law by the end of June.

Lam has tweaked the amendments but refused to pull the bill, saying it is vital to plug a long-standing “loophole”.

She has also said speedy action is needed to ensure a Hong Kong man suspected of murdering his girlfriend can be sent to Taiwan for trial.

Opposition to the bill has united a broad range of the community, from usually pro-establishment business people and lawyers to students, pro-democracy figures and religious groups.

Insurance agents, executives and small entrepreneurs joined bus drivers and mechanics in the streets on Sunday. Dozens of people told Reuters it was their first protest march, with some remarking on the strong sense of unity among the diverse crowds.

“I come here to fight,” said a wheelchair-bound, 78-year-old man surnamed Lai, who was among the first to arrive.

Teacher Garry Chiu joined the protest with his wife and 1-year-old daughter, saying: “It is no longer about me.”

“I need to save my daughter. If the law is implemented, anyone can disappear from Hong Kong. No one will get justice in China. We know there are no human rights,” Chiu added.

“The extradition bill will directly threaten the core values of Hong Kong and rule of law,” said 21-year-old Kelvin Tam, a student in London. “It will remove the firewall of Hong Kong judicial independence.”

The amendments would simplify case-by-case arrangements to allow extradition of wanted suspects to jurisdictions, including mainland China, Macau and Taiwan, beyond the 20 with which Hong Kong already has extradition treaties.

Opponents of the bill question the fairness and transparency of the Chinese court system and worry about Chinese security forces contriving charges.

Chris Patten, the last British governor of Hong Kong, said on Thursday the bill would “strike a terrible blow ... against the rule of law, against Hong Kong’s stability and security, against Hong Kong’s position as a great international trading hub”.

Foreign governments have also expressed concern, warning of the impact on Hong Kong’s reputation as an international financial hub, and noting that foreigners wanted in China risk getting ensnared in Hong Kong.

Concerns were highlighted on Saturday with news that a local high court judge had been reprimanded by the chief justice after his signature appeared on a public petition against the bill.

Reuters reported earlier that several senior Hong Kong judges were worried about the changes, noting a lack of trust in mainland courts as well as the limited nature of extradition hearings.

Human rights groups have repeatedly cited the alleged use of torture, arbitrary detentions, forced confessions and problems accessing lawyers in China.

Hong Kong officials have defended the plans, even as they raised the threshold of extraditable offences to crimes carrying penalties of seven years or more.

They say the laws carry adequate safeguards, including the protection of independent local judges who will hear cases before any approval by the Hong Kong chief executive. No one would be extradited if they face political or religious persecution or torture, or the death penalty, they say.

“We continue to listen to a wide cross-section of views and opinions and remain to open to suggestions on ways to improve the new regime,” a government official said on Sunday."

61,2,"Trump held an impromptu press conference in the White House Rose Garden shortly after cutting his meeting short with Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer. Speaking to reporters, Trump, with a Mueller investigation infographic in hand, claimed he was completely exonerated, asserted that he doesn't do ""cover-ups"" and slammed Democrats, saying they were the ones who actually committed a crime for carrying out so many probes.

The Donald did not stop there, however. Trump's Twitter fingers took over, and the US president composed a four-tweet statement proclaiming Democrats were ""tearing the United States apart"" and that it would be impossible for them to ""investigate and legislate simultaneously.""

While Trump maintains that he doesn't do cover-ups, many netizens pointed out one well-known ""cover-up"" in the form of hush money paid to porn star Stormy Daniels, which became public information following his former lawyer Michael Cohen's testimony.

Earlier today, Sputnik reported that Pelosi and Schumer's meeting with Trump began with a brief mention of infrastructure, only to quickly dissolve into a conversation about Pelosi's Wednesday morning assertion that a number of Democrats believe the president has something to hide."

None of you have been as progressive as I am. Granted, most of this is because I know many progressives of varying races and I do not own a car. I have decided to become more progressive this week by ignoring all NYC buses that have not been converted to the more environmentally friendly hybrid bus. Unfortunately, this means I have to wait for over an hour on some occasions and have been late to work three times this week. Fortunately, this could help me lose my job (I work for an Evil Conglomerate at the moment, and they are so evil it takes several write ups and several management meetings to fire anyone just in case they sue!), and losing my job will be just another battle won in The Good Fight[sup]®[/sup]!



Edit: I should not have been gloating. I have finally seen that some have led more progressive lives. For this very reason, I have now stopped using the toilet and reported my landlord to the IRS.

I considered drinking a litre of vodka, stuffing the contents of my medicine cabinet into my miserable furry body and slitting my paws.



Then I realized that despite my sorry condition, I am still worth more to the state alive. After all, I am a natural leader and 'special', just like the One. Therefore, I relenquish my command, by titles, and my concubines, and will report for re-education. I, a mere fallen leaf from the tree of socialism, commit myself to the the mighty current of inevitibility.



I have my shovel and my i-Pod, and stand ready to serve...



I look at this as a real voyage of self-discovery. It really helped me get in touch with my inner self and realize that I am a creature of infinite compassion and tolerance, especially toward those who must be crushed under the heel of the Party. It is out of sheer love of all humanity (and Huge Manatees) and respect for diverse viewpoints that I think we should hunt down all the people who don't feel guilty and make them pay. I think that really shows how much I care about the little guy. It doesn't really matter what I made on the test. The important thing is that I took the test. That made me feel really good about myself, because it shows that I am socially aware and care about progress. I just wish that other people could be as wonderful and compassionate as I am. I feel guilty that some people don't feel guilty, which makes me a better person than they are, which in turn makes me feel even more guilty. It's like the perfect circle of guilt.



Commissar;



i shovel - having commited the crime of having the ""one who must never be named"" (RWR) openly displayed on my own shovel has begun re-education.



168 hrs. straight with toothpicks holding eyes wide and MSNBC on screen has seemed to do trick - i see folly of my capitalist pig (spit) past and have recommitted myself to the party.

I feel thrill going up leg - is this normal?



i - shovel - continued on to phase 2 - listening to every one of the chosen ones speeches from his days as party organizer thru his glorius ass-ention to Czar dom hood. His wisdom touches the heavens. i shovel - declare my undying obedience & loyalty to the OBAMA!

For his teleprompter is the one i have been waiting for.



i have to admit - being in solitary with the ""View"" piped into my dark cell all night has your humble servant shovel a changed man - next time - on test - i score -8950, i think.

i promise to start up the ""Norilsk Gulag - Save the Polar Bears Club"".



i thank you commissar for helping your lowly shovel and will double my output of shovel production in the name of the motherland.

Re-education works. Soon the masses, well OK, more masses.



With great sadness I must not only report my score (575) but also report to Karl Marx Treatment Center ""flower bed"" in the back of the complex. Just great, 49 years spying on ..err.. assisting the Party and it's all gone down the drain. There must be some way I can blame the score on some nefarious capitalist plot.



Comrade Kaos,



As I'm in a giving mood today, I'll float you a pardon for this transgression. You were merely upholding Party Doctrine that it is incumbent upon every Comrade to denounce anyone and everyone they even begin to suspect might be plotting against The Party. Bitter infighting distracts proles from the massive infusions of CHope, and therefore must be promoted. Proles need a sense of entitlement for our strategy to be successful, but they must not feel TOO entitled lest they begin to believe we could be doing more for them.



Dig on.

540, Bitches! Although not as nearly as guilty as the Party thinks I ought to be.



It needed more gun-related questions, methinks. Then you would have definitely outed me as a thoughtcriminal!



Glorious Red Square, I am pleased to announce that I scored a -8,765,456,478,219.56! Since I had to cheat to obtain such a score, I will add a bonus -500 points. I do believe that should make me eligible and the leading candidate for the open position of Guilt Tsar, In addition, it is clear from the confessions above, that I have plenty of fresh prospects.



Lenin be praised! It makes me feel so more equal than others!



BTW, I love the way you confiscated one of my favorite Far Side cartoons to be used for the People's edification.



I thought we had agreed to call them Commissars, or at least 'ssars...



You would, however, be a fantastic candidate, IMHO.



I denounce myself for scoring a 500. Sadly I take public transportation and have to rub shoulders with all the local progressives and similar wonderful people.



Also I was unsure how to vote on home ownership. I live on my sailboat (decadent capitalist pig yacht to the made progressive with a cardboard sign on the street corner) but rent the slip it's in. I do have 5 acres in Alaska though, where I plan to cut a few trees down when I get up there...



Also how would you score someone who owns more than 10 People's Motivational Tools, and several thousand rounds of ammo for them?



At any rate I soundly denounce myself. My shovel got redistributed to someone who did not have one. I must either now dig without one, or redistribute one from someone who has one.



Mmmm perhaps there is only one shovel, and everyone gets a crack at it as it is redistributed from the ""have a shovel"" to the ""does not have a shovel.""



Pupovich - you win hands down. When will you be ready to assume the position of Guilt Czar with Guilt-Inducing Pup as your mascot?



Perhaps this pup could be standing next to a sign that says something about how he was wronged by capitalism and calling for Change. But all I can think of right now is a sign that says ""I voted for Obama and all I got was this rubber chicken.""



But what do we do when the duct tape factory does not meet it's quota? I have two pairs of boots and a beat up pair of tennis shoes. Which of these will I be allowed to keep? My feet are size 14w, so I use more shoe and boot resources than the average comrade, does that mean I will have to work more in order to get the duct tape I need to cover my feet? If all are equal, when will The One equalize shoe size?



Oh dear....I logged in at:

Which train platform do I report to for re-education?



Loose the Hounds. So to speak.



Comrades,



I am in a quandry. I recently discovered that I do in fact harbor some guilt over all the goodies that I am entitled to, just because I was born the planet.

I was getting ready to take my beauty nap (un-needed of course but what the hey) when this horrible thought occurred to me.

That free house, car, health insurance, college education, food and beer that Obama's going to fork over to me as I am a complete leech on society I began to think that, 'SOMEBODY ELSE WILL ACTUALLY HAVE TO WORK AND SUFFER A LITTLE TO PROVIDE IT TO ME.'

 I started to feel a little guilty for those folks!!!!!!!! I know this just ain't right. These are my entitlement goodies Obama promised! Why would this horrid thought enter my young little brain? Maybe a failure in my state sponsored public education system perhaps?



I need expert advice to deal with this situation. I stand by to do some serious groveling to seek a solution, as I am entitled also to a restful little beauty nap, without any horrid thoughts intruding in on my snoozy bliss.



Great and Glorious Chairman M. S. Punchenko,



How can this humble, misguided, Comrade ever thank you enough. Your superior wisdom and intellect is an inspiration to us all. After your humble suggestion, that I 'volunteer' to platform six, well as I was sitting on platform six, and waiting to begin my new job as a latrine digger first class, (a lucky assignment much sought after by others but given to me by that super friendly guy with the bullwhip before I entered the cattle car) I could not contain my joy.



I wept Glorious Chairman, the thought of three free healthy meals a day and actual work that benefits the masses all provided for me by you all due to you and fellow Senior Party members superior knowledge as to what is best for all of us.... (I must pass on this to you also wise Chairman, the mid-level party members also care about me and the masses, such as the kind chap on the platform six medical station, who was also kind enough to inquire about my health and went so far as to warn me that I was going to feel a little 'pressure' as he examined my lower backside nether regions, I never knew that involved both his hands on my shoulders, by the way but who am I to question free health care now).



I stand humbled (and pretty damn bow-legged now.........oops, I mean oh so grateful for the free exam, by the way if you could pass on to me his name, as I really didn't get it through all the grunting, I'd like to send him some flowers). I will no longer carry any doubts that you and giverment know whats is best for me and will never have any bad thoughts again. I wish you warm thoughts ( even though where I'm at right now it is just a tad bit nippy) and may you continue to inspire me as to what a true progressive is all about.



I have but one thing to add to the wonderful and wise words of the Chairman. Comrade Snoogie Woogums, while the Chairman is quite correct in his advice to you in regard to money and your right to government money that we provide you out of the compassion of our heart, you are also correct when you sense guilt on your part. You simply have a case of misdirected guilt. Comrade, you should feel guilty, not for the stipends that you receive, rather for the poisonous, earth destroying carbon dioxide that you and other like minded pollution spewing proles inflict upon the world every day! I do hope that I have cleared this up for you. I care more for this world than others, and since being promoted to Guilt Czar, it is my duty and privilege.

Oy! I almost forgot!



it is earth hour today!

At 20:00 your time, be sure to be a good comrade and turn off all your lights, and it would be a good time to catch up on those pesky household chores. Utilize your dish washer and vacuum cleaner. Do some laundry, hey how many years has it been since you ironed your clothes? Bake a roast or better yet COOKIES. Dont forget to turn on your TV and or entertainment center. Fire up the air conditioner or space heater as the situation dictates and dont forget to use your ceiling fans.

And sure, why not-- Microwave or Air Pop some popcorn and blend up a milkshake or smoothie -- you deserve it for combating Global Warming[sup] [/sup] and saving the earth.



Oh My Stalin! Your Dear Leader scored a +735!! That's a perfect score, but in the wrong direction. I think Condeleeza Rice slipped some Roofies in my mao-tai drink the last time she was here and whispered sweet nothings in my ear - ""Capitarism is good"", ""Sociarism is bad"", ""Barrack Hussein Obama is an unquarified affirmative -action dumbass"", ""Tim Geithener is a snakeoil salesman who rook rike a deer in the headrights"". She say other pirrow-talk bonbons too, that brack bitch.

And I was also thinking of adding the fifth line - ""Purveyor of Yellow Currents"" but it's entirely up to you.



Yes Comrade Guardian, I plan on manning the barricades, just as I did back in the Motherland to overthrow the Tsar. I am going to need some help with what to put on my sign, and will need to go to the Bunker for this. I have also purchased a Laika shirt to wear that day!



The Toadyism, the groveling, the shear awesome supplication and deference shown by the Pup make it clear he has no equal beyond himself in bandying for and to the hierarchy.

Truly he deserves his own hydrant (Red of course) and grooming on a weekly basis.

I stand in awe of his powers. (I may be standing in something else of his too)

Unleash him I say. Let loose the hounds of psy war.



What?







First Pupovich gets promoted to Marshal, and now he gets a bunch of titles like some returning conqueror? Just what has he conquered?



But more importantly, what about me? ME!!! 



So you're gonna make me dig into the archives and MimeSwipe that old rant I copy and paste every time Pupovich is made more equal than Pinkie:

Didn't Pupovich just get promoted to Vice Chairman? And now he wants to be General Secretary? And he's being promoted to Marshal?



What about me? I bust my buns for The Party around here, and what do I get? ""Here, Pinkie, I found you a real nice guy in a red hat. He enjoys digging long ditches on the beach at sunset."" They're all losers after only one thing--my vodka ration card!



I might add that I'm not the one currently measuring the Empress for her cut-out. That's the work of a certain furry, four legged commissar/vice chairman/general secretary-wannabe-but-might-begrudgingly-settle-for-marshal. Plus he keeps letting the Criminally Insane Vodkov off the hook, when he should have had his show trial months ago. 



Pupovich gets nervous at everything I do. Every time I come up with a new movement and/or cause, he trembles and glances around and says stuff like, ""I don't know about this, Commissarka, I don't want to lose the desk in the corner office suite we share."" Always trying to dissuade me from my glorious movements--wait a minute, that sounded weird--my--well, he just never thinks my ideas are well thought out. He's like Jiminy Cricket. Maybe you could give him a top hat and umbrella, and promote him to Jiminy Pupovich. 



In fact, you might say he's like one of those digitally lobotomized yada yada 19 percenters (sorry, my carpal mime syndrome is flaring up again, can't type it all out).



Moreover, he's been denounced several times--once he even denounced himself.



On the plus side, he did save me when Zampolit shot me off the ledge and I landed on that flagpole. And he did inspire the notion of the Trojan Donkey. But I'm the one who took credit for it, dammit!



I also awarded him Pinkie's Prestigious Beet of the Week Award, simply because he was feeling unappreciated. Talk about your overdeveloped sense of entitlement! But good feel-good Progressive that I am, I gave it to him.



In the meantime, look at all the initiatives I've initiated in recent months--making up an extensive list of Bush's crimes, my ""perch-in"" on the ledge, the People's Vigilante Committee, and Project Giant Trojan Donkey that's full of condoms for all the boys and girls at the convention in Denver. Why, I've done more to raise awareness and show how much I care than anyone else here!



What have the rest of you done? Anything? Anything at all?



P.S. Only I don't wanna be a marshal. I can just hear some smart-aleck like Betinov putting on his whiny Jan Brady voice and chanting, ""Marshal, Marshal, MARSHAL!"" every time I enter the bunker. 



And by the way, after all these months, he's STILL hogging the ""Reserved for Beet of the Week"" parking space in front of Party headquarters. I don't even know what he has parked there anymore. It's covered with unpaid parking tickets; menus from Chinese restaurants; flyers that say, ""Foreclosure? Bad Credit? Stupidity? We Can Help!"" and tracts for ""Tea Parties.""



I might be cheap and easy, but not anymore. From now on I'll just be easy . . . but you're gonna pay.

Chairman M. S. Punchenko; Marshal Pupovich;



Your kind words and advice along with the 'helpful' assistance from the staff here at 'resort' camp has been able to channel my misguided guilt into the right direction. Before if I was at a resort that did not have any hot water or clean sheets or pillows for that matter, I would have lodge a complaint. It would not have occurred to me that by complaining, I would further harm the environment by using precious energy to heat the water and contribute to global warming, or by using water to actually wash clothes and bathe that some poor farmer in Africa would not be able to water his crops and may starve. My guilt as to the damage I caused by my former greedy self is now channeled in the right direction.



I must report that the camp the fine Chairman suggested that I take my little 'vacation ' to, is totally ECO-FRIENDLY. I know this will warm the cockles of the Chairman's and Marshall's hearts.



The work that I'm doing as a Latrine Digger First Class is going swimmingly, which brings up an interesting tid-bit on how the five year plan is being implemented at the camp. As the wise party leadership knows all latrines are to be dug to a depth of three meters, however due to a slight oversight the camps latrines were only dug to a depth of two meters (I'm sure the Party will find the person that made the mistake in carrying out this directive and have a little chat with him about this oversight) so the camp owner decided to correct it.



The camp owner is totally eco friendly and did not want to impact the environment anymore than he has to by digging any new latrines to meet this requirement, and in his wise decision, decided to dig the EXISTING latrines that are IN USE one more meter to be in total compliance with all party directives.



As a Latrine Digger First Class you can just IMAGINE my joy on hearing this glorious news. I was so enthralled that I was really going to help the environment even more than I am already doing by only taking a COLD shower once a week FIVE days from now, that I went right to work on this project.



Again Chairman, Marshall my total gratitude for all you have done for me up to this point and I hope my humble little reports I'm sending you DOWNWIND from Camp Pelosi you are finding interesting.



I got 610.

I must confess something, I am very ashamed that I turned on all of my outside lights tonight at 8:30 when I was supposed to support the dark earth hour by turning all lights off.



I am so in need of small group therapy for transformation."
66,2,"Even though we are told the economy is doing great, all the evidence shows that main street Americans are struggling more and more every day. A recent report claimed that the costs of goods have risen to the point that 25% must use debt to pay for necessities, such as food.

According to a new Experian report that came out last week, Americans have an average of $6,506 in credit card debt. But some expenses are weighing much more heavily on the credit cards of the average American…

Necessities, like food and rent, are being put on credit cards. A full 23% of Americans say that paying for basic necessities such as rent, utilities, and food contributes the most to their credit card debt, according to a new survey of approximately 2,200 U.S. adults that CNBC Make It performed in conjunction with Morning Consult. Another 12% say medical bills are the biggest portion of their debt. Medical bills additionally likely contribute to the purchases of food on a credit card.

This news isn’t shocking unless you believe the mainstream media’s glorification of the false “recovery” we’ve experienced since the Great Recession of a decade ago. American households have taken on historic levels of debt, which will crush them in the next economic downturn.

Everyday expenses continue to rise, and as the shadow inflation increases, it also threatens to wipe out the middle class – what’s left of it anyway. In fact, middle-class life is now 30% more expensive than it was 20 years ago, according to a separate report by CNBC. The cost of things such as college, housing, and child care has risen precipitously: Tuition at public universities doubled between 1996 and 2016 and housing prices in popular cities have quadrupled, Alissa Quart, author and executive director of the Economic Hardship Reporting Project, tells CNBC Make It.

It has become common to rely on debt, live above one’s means, and spend more than is made. The Federal Reserve’s money printing policy isn’t helping either, as its goal is to enrich themselves and the political elite that continues to allow the top few to impoverish the rest of America. Central banks have become the evil fire which government officials fan the flames of.

But, there has been a bit of a lack of personal responsibility running through most of the country as well. Americans spend an average of $483 a month on non-essentials such as dining out, entertainment, luxury items, and vacations, Schwab’s 2019 Modern Wealth report found. Debt reduction is a key to preparing for the next recession: which will happen, the only question is “when?”

There are several ways to reduce your debt, but it will likely require cutting spending on unnecessary things and saying no to expensive dinners in restaurants. Debt reduction is a gargantuan task, but it can be done.

In fact, credit card companies have been given more leeway in order to collect debts recently. Future Money Trends‘ James Davis suggests you avoid this by simply avoiding debt.

This is an unfortunate change to the rules, however, experiencing a call from a debt collector can be avoided by avoiding debt in the first place. When you borrow someone else’s money and do not repay it as you originally stated in the contract, you will be bothered and harassed. People are going to want their money back, and debt collectors honestly don’t care much whether you have it."
68,2,"WASHINGTON—President Donald Trump says it’s “case closed.” But Democrats are just getting started with Robert Mueller.

House Democrats have scheduled a series of hearings this coming week on the special counsel’s report as they intensify their focus on the Russia probe and pick up the pace on an investigative “path” — in the words of Speaker Nancy Pelosi — that some of them hope leads to impeachment of the president. In doing so, they are trying to draw the public’s attention on the allegations that Trump sought to obstruct a federal investigation and they want to highlight his campaign’s contacts with Russia in the 2016 election.And they will lay the groundwork for an appearance from Mueller himself, despite his stated desire to avoid the spotlight.

The hearings will focus on the two main topics of Mueller’s report, obstruction of justice and Russian election interference.

The House Judiciary Committee plans to cover the first topic at a Monday hearing on “presidential obstruction and other crimes.” The House Intelligence Committee on Wednesday intends to review the counterintelligence implications of the Russian meddling. Mueller said there was not enough evidence to establish a conspiracy between the Trump campaign and Russia, but he said he could not exonerate Trump on obstruction.

On Tuesday, the House has scheduled a vote to authorize contempt cases against Attorney General William Barr and former White House counsel Donald McGahn for failing to comply with subpoenas from the Democratic-controlled House.

Barr defied a subpoena to provide an unredacted version of Mueller’s report, along with underlying evidence. McGahn, who is frequently referenced in the report, has defied subpoenas to provide documents and testify before the House Judiciary Committee.

Language in the resolution would make it easier for committee chairmen to take the Trump administration to court. Those chairmen could take legal action to enforce subpoenas in the future without a vote of the full House, so long as the chairmen have approval from a five-person, bipartisan group where Democrats have the majority.

With Trump pledging that “we’re fighting all the subpoenas,” Democratic leaders want to avoid repeated floor votes on contempt resolutions that detract from their legislative agenda.

The procession of hearings and votes in the week ahead is partly designed to mollify anxious Democrats who have pushed Pelosi, D-Calif., to begin impeachment proceedings immediately . Pelosi has so far rejected that option , preferring a slower, more methodical approach to investigating the president, including the court fights and hearings.

During a meeting with the House Judiciary Committee chairman, New York Rep. Jerrold Nadler, and other committee heads last week, Pelosi made the case that she would rather see Trump voted out of office and “in prison” than merely impeached, according to a report in Politico. A person familiar with the exchange confirmed the account to The Associated Press.

The latest approach appears to have temporarily satisfied the restless House Democrats.

Maryland Rep. Jamie Raskin, who pleaded with Pelosi last month to start an inquiry, said the votes and hearings are going to be enough, for now, as they wait to see what happens in court.

“I am very satisfied that things are moving in the right direction,” Raskin said. “And I think the American people are getting increasingly educated and engaged about the lawlessness of the president.”

Rep. David Cicilline, a Judiciary Committee member who favors an impeachment inquiry, took pains to avoid separating himself from top Democrats such as Pelosi.

“We should never proceed with impeachment for political reasons. We should never refuse to proceed with impeachment for political reasons,” Cicilline, D-R.I., said on “Fox News Sunday.”

Educating the American public on what is in the Mueller report is a priority for Democrats, who believe Trump and his allies have created the public impression that the report said there was no obstruction of justice. Trump has made that assertion repeatedly, echoing Barr’s judgment that there was not enough evidence in the report to support a criminal obstruction charge. Mueller said in the report that he could not exonerate Trump on that point.

The special counsel did not find evidence to establish a criminal conspiracy between Trump’s campaign and Russia. But the report details multiple contacts between the two.

California Rep. Adam Schiff, chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, said the goal of the Wednesday hearing will be to explain to the American people “the serious counterintelligence concerns raised by the Mueller report, examine the depth and breadth of the unethical and unpatriotic conduct it describes, and produce prescriptive remedies to ensure that this never happens again.”

Republicans are poised to defend the president at the hearings and challenge Democrats on the decision not to open impeachment hearings.

Georgia Rep. Doug Collins, the top Republican on the House Judiciary Committee, sent Nadler a letter Friday calling the upcoming hearing a “mock impeachment hearing” and warning Democrats to be civil when speaking of the president.

Collins said in the letter that outside of impeachment proceedings, “it is out of order for a member of Congress, in debate, to engage in personalities with the president or express an opinion, even a third party opinion, accusing the president of a crime. The rules are clear on this point.”"

70,2,"Een overtuigende monografieToen de Tweede Wereldoorlog in Nederland ten einde liep, moest - om een Bijltjesdag te voorkomen - snel, streng en rechtvaardig afgerekend worden met politieke scheveschaatsrijders en collaborateurs. De Bijzondere Rechtspleging, waarvan de uitgangspunten al in 1943 in Londen vastgesteld waren, trad in werking.De vader van voormalig militair en gevangenisdirecteur Henk Eefting kreeg als Drents NSB-boer met de Bijzondere Rechtspleging te maken. Eefting schreef daarom over dit thema een gedegen monografie: De Bijzondere Rechtspleging. Rampzalige gevolgen voor politieke delinquenten en collaborateurs (Uitgeverij Aspekt, 2016). Hierin betoogt hij op overtuigende wijze dat de naoorlogse rechtspraak over oorlogsdelinquenten een vorm van schaduwjustitie was en ontaardde in misstanden en schaamteloze vertoningen en veroordelingen.Het boek is inhoudelijk breder dan de titel doet vermoeden. Het beslaat qua thematiek en chronologie het ontstaan van de NSB en SS in de jaren 1930 tot de 'definitieve' afrekening met oorlogsmisdadiger en andere 'foute' Nederlanders in de jaren 1950, evenals een analyse over de eenzijdigheid in de naoorlogse geschiedschrijving rond dit thema. Eeftings boek heeft, zo formuleert hij het zelf, de volgende missie:In deze bespreking concentreer ik me op de hoofdthematiek uit Eeftings monografie. Dit is het gedeelte over de Bijzondere Rechtspleging en de historiografische en praktische correcties die Eefting op dit vlak naar voren brengt.De Nederlandse regering in Londen nam. In 1944 waarschuwden de Gereformeerde Kerken in Nederland (GKN) de regering voor de gevolgen van dit besluit.'Zij hadden,' aldus Eefting, 'een vooruitziende blik.'Problematisch was verder dat de regering had bepaald dat de Bijzondere Rechtspleging snel ten uitvoer gebracht moest worden, zodra Nederland of een deel ervan was bevrijd. Men dacht aan een half jaar berechtiging voor een geschatte 100.000 gevallen. Doel was om een Bijltjesdag te voorkomen. Door de snelle en massale arrestaties die in 1944 in bevrijd gebied begonnen, slaagde dit plan in theorie. De Bijltjesdagen, zo stelt Eefting, vonden echter daarná plaats in de interneringskampen.Vreemd was dat de regering al van tevoren precies vaststelde hoe de rechtspraak moest verlopen en hoelang het proces mocht duren. Onafhankelijke rechtspraak vergt gedegen onderzoek en dus tijd en zorgvuldigheid. Eefting:De regering in Londen verkeek zich bij de planvorming volledig op de inrichting van interneringskampen. Na de bevrijding moesten deze kampen nog volledig worden opgezet, gebouwd en/of ingericht worden. Daarnaast bleken er aanzienlijk meer mensen geïnterneerd te moeten worden dan was beraamd. Namelijkin plaats van de geraamde 100.000.maar mensen zonder specifieke opleiding. Zij gingen vaak op een onmenselijke manier met de gevangenen om.In totaal werden er ongeveer 130 (provisorische) kampen uit de grond gestampt, waarvan Kamp Westerbork - tijdens de oorlog Durchgangslager voor Nederlandse Joden - er één was. In minstens de helft van deze kampen behoorde een barbaars regime tot de orde van de dag:De voeding in de kampen was minimaal. Gedetineerden vielen tijdens hun detentie gemiddeld 20 kilo af, zo heeft onderzoek aangetoond. Eefting vervolgt met een lijstje incidenten die in de interneringskampen plaatsvonden. Zo werden in een kamp in Axel, Zeeuws-Vlaanderen, 'twee fatsoenlijke vrouwen'. In Almelo paste men veelvuldig de 'moffentrap' toe:. In ZweelooIn Groningen, Dordrecht en andere plaatsen mishandelde men vrij consequent vrouwen. In Westerbork werden met enige regelmaat, in of buiten hun barak. Een kamp in Almelo had zelfs een soortdie een gevangene een oog stuksloeg en. En zo gaat Henk Eefting nog een tijdje door.Eefting trekt enkele conclusies die mij niet onterecht lijken. Op het tegenwoordige terrein van voormalig Kamp Westerbork herinnert slechts één zin aan de opsluiting van politieke gevangenen aldaar in de jaren 1945-1948. Hierin worden deze gevangenen 'landverraders' genoemd. Eefting stelt voor dat een bescheiden plaquette met kritische tekst het verleden van dit kamp meer recht zou doen. Hij noemt die ene zin in Westerbork '(382)Eefting concludeert verder, op basis van het verloop van de Bijzondere Rechtspraak en de daaropvolgende sancties, dat.

72,2,"It’s always sad when a person has the best intentions but doesn’t execute a plan well, especially when it comes to caring for animals.

Plenty of people who end up hoarders didn’t start out that way — they get overwhelmed and soon their desire to care for critters is far greater than their means.

In many hoarding cases, it is not uncommon to find homes destroyed by feces and urine, with animals in poor shape. In the more dire cases, sometimes dead animals will be discovered.

But this case is one of the most extreme, with a staggering body count and revolting conditions. The Animal Rescue League of Iowa posted about the appalling case on Facebook on June 4.

TRENDING: Nick Sandmann Has Perfect Response When Ex-Kamala Harris Staffer Attacks Him

“This is by far the worst hoarding case ARL Iowa has seen in more than 10 years,” the CEO of the Animal Rescue League of Iowa, Tom Colvin, said, according to the post.

“It’s absolutely horrendous,” he continued. “I don’t even have the words to describe how bad this is. We were already over capacity prior to this rescue with more than 1,100 cats in our care, so we are going to need a lot of help from the public with this one.”

The rescue team had to spend the entire day removing cats of all ages from a residence in Central Iowa.

Multiple buildings on the property were loaded with filth and cats.

“Cats are still being captured tonight and there have already been nearly 100 living cats rescued and nearly 200 more cats recovered that were already deceased,” the ARL post continued.

“Dozens of cats were pressed up against open windows, trying to get fresh air. Air quality levels inside the house are so toxic that ARL rescuers are required to wear respirators and protective suits and are only allowed in the house for 30 minutes at a time.

“Inside, multiple feet of feces and garbage covered every square inch of the home, including kitchen counters.”

Not only was the squalor barely comprehensible, the ARL reported that the refrigerators and freezers were full of deceased felines.

The count as of June 7 was 142 living cats and kittens and 194 dead.

The rescue, stretched to breaking, is accepting donations and also has an Amazon wishlist that people can help out with.

The owner has been identified as a 65-year-old man, and he is being charged with five counts of animal neglect and three counts of failure to dispose of a dead animal, according to KSFY-TV.

These animals may have had a rough life trapped in their own filth, but 142 of them now have a new lease on life thanks to dedicated rescuers and their generous supporters.

73,2,"When an individual is called upon to make a major decision due to a serious medical problem, the individual must be in possession of accurate information. He also needs to be careful that he does not overestimate the benefits of the recommended procedure. Only with this information in hand can a proper decision be made.

Several studies have been published investigating what people perceive the benefit of a medical treatment is versus what the facts show the benefit is. In all these studies it has been shown that individuals vastly overestimate the benefits of a procedure and greatly underestimate the potential harms.

In a study published in JAMA Internal Medicine researchers reviewed over 30 studies to determine if patients understood the risks and benefits of different medical treatments. Their conclusion was that to a great extent they did not. When questioned, only about 10% of patients stated that their physicians discussed potential harm from the procedure. Without a clear presentation of the facts, a proper decision cannot be made.

The following table is a summary of the medical procedure and the estimated public perception of benefit as published in the Annals of Family Medicine, November 2012:

Participants in this study were also asked to state what the minimal benefit that the procedure needed to achieve in order for them to consider undertaking the procedure. In most cases the minimum benefit stated by the participant was far higher than what the actual benefit was.

In other words if people understood the actual benefits of many procedures most would refuse to undertake them on the basis that they are of such little benefit that they are not worth the risk. As Dr. Michael Greger states in his video, “The Actual Benefit of Diet vs Drugs”: “The medical profession oversells the benefits of drugs for chronic disease since so few patients would apparently take them if doctors divulged the truth.”

The large majority of people do not benefit from even the best drug

Even a high-risk patient has only a 5% chance of gaining any benefit from a drug he is taking for heart disease over a period of 5 years. In other words, there is a 95% chance he will gain no benefit at all but he may still suffer from potentially serious side effects.

Researchers found that the lower limit of acceptable benefit to convince a patient to take that drug for 5 years was 20%. The participants included patients who had just been discharged from a Coronary Care Unit. Once aware of the actual benefit, the large majority of patients would simply refuse treatment because it did not meet the minimal benefit deemed necessary to justify treatment.

You should make absolutely sure that your physician has given you all the facts about a recommended treatment before agreeing to undergo it.

Pelosi defends altered photo of Democratic women



 

 

As we see here, Comrade Chairwoman Nancy Thomasovna Pelosi of the People’s Congress saw the need to communicate the truth of the solidarity of the Party, and used photo editing techniques to add members of the People’s Congress to a recent photo in order to convey the truth of Party unity. Photography can often be deceitful, especially when such a photo needed to include recently rehabilitated members of the Party (especially Comrade Representative Debbie Lavrentovna Wasserman-Schultz, who was recently rehabilitated after being disciplined for a poor performance during the election).



On the converse side, some figures whom the Party deems to be counter-revolutionaries or wreckers may need to be removed from photos because, in their dishonor through betraying the workers and peasants of Amerika, they no longer merit being pictured as humans. Those who betray the Party are not even human, so why should they be allowed to remain in photos as if they were honorable persons?



You see, photography is not meant to record history, but rather communicate the truths the Party seeks to communicate to the People. The Party must alter photographs and even documents in order to teach the People how to correctly think about history and present circumstances.

Both of you have made posts I consider more than worthy of Pinkie's prestigious Beet of the Week Award. 



However, it is against my policy to award BOTW more than once in a single thread.



I suppose the two of you could split the award. But I also know that each of you has won BOTW separately on previous occasions--multiple times, in fact, both of you. (Don't make me search for all the links again to prove it, Betinov. Just don't.) 



Therefore, because you are progs, it goes without saying (but I'll say it anyway) that neither of you will take too kindly to receiving anything less than what you've grown accustomed to. For each of you, it must be the whole Beet, for the whole Week, with the whole bumpersticker and the whole parking space in front of Cube headquarters, or . . . no, not nothing. Or you'll both embark on a riotous rampage, smashing windows, upending vehicles, looting stores before torching them, and at some point dropping your drawers to raise awareness of how royally, imperially pissed you are because you didn't get all that you've been conditioned to believe you're entitled to. 



But from each according to his ability, to each according to his need! Both of you have the ability, but the comrade who started this thread has never received BOTW, so I shall redistribute what is yours to Nomenklatura-climber. 



So congratulations, Comrade Nomenklatura-climber! You are the latest recipient of Pinkie's prestigious Beet of the Week Award! 

 



And something for your mother to put on her own ladder:

 



Plus you have use of the ""Reserved for Beet of the Week"" parking space in front of Cube headquarters. However, you are responsible for cleaning up any oilstains left behind once your vehicle is towed away to make room for the next recipient. You are also responsible to pay for the towing, the impoundment fees, the space in the impoundment lot, and the release fee. You will also be responsible for cleaning up any oilstains left behind in the impoundment lot. 



Enjoy!

I could almost taste it. That sweet beet was tickling my taste center (I have no taste buds, but the memory of the taste is stored) when it was yanked away. I've been yanked, and not in a good way. If I had any remaining bodily orifices, I'd go crap on a cop car.

Our friend and radio host, 

 Yesterday this thread got into World Net Daily Our friend and radio host, Andrea Shea King , devoted part of her WND article to the People's Cube: “But can you fake a birth certificate?”



Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi used the wizardry of Photoshop to include a few female Democratic members of Congress into a formal photograph, raising more than a few eyebrows and placing Madame Pelosi on the defensive.



All this prompted writer and graphic artist Oleg Atbashian, a Ukrainian émigré, to mock the image with one of his own.



The creator of the satirical website ThePeoplesCube.com, accompanied the image with this bit of cloaked wisdom: “You see, photography is not meant to record history, but rather communicate the truths the party seeks to communicate to the people. The party must alter photographs and even documents in order to teach the people how to correctly think about history and present circumstances.” 



The quote she used actually belongs to Nomenclatura Climber. Congratulations, comrade, with your speedy climbing to the top! (But perhaps I should revise his avatar, so it has less of Red Square in it.)

Dear Comrade Director,



The avatar belongs to the People, and so the People will decide what it looks like. But, what's more, your thoughts are my thoughts, and so what I say is what you say when we say it in a Politically Correct Way! 



Progress towards Unified Thought! Down with individual identity (unless the Party gives you one)!

I didn't think so!

• Eksperimentel evidens taler stærkt for min konklusion (der bestrides uden god grund af Lenski og andre) at strækt selekterede mutationer i isbjørnegenerne fungerer ved at bryde eller svække ftidligere eksisterende funktioner.
• En ""funktion"" ved et protein er et molekylært træk eller en aktivitet på lavere niveau, så som at være et gear eller en kæde. Dette bør ikke forveksles med komplekse fænotypiske træk som ""lavere cholesterol"" eller ""gør organismen lykkelig."" At ignorere denne skelnen leder til megen forvirring.

Dette er den første af en serie af artikler, der svarer på den omfattende kritik af Darwin Devolves publiceret af Richard Lenski på hans blog Telliamed Revisited . Professor Lenski er måske den mest kvalificerede videnskabsmand i verden til at analysere argumenterne i bogen. Han er Hannah Distinguished Professor for mikrobebiologi [Eng: Microbial Ecology] ved Michigan State University, han er en MacArthur (""Genius Award"") Fellow, og medlem af National Academy of Sciences. Han har hundredevis af publikationer bag sig og har også en stærk intereresse for videnskabens historie og filosofi. Hans eget laboratoriums arbejde med udviklingsteori er et centralt fokus i bogen. Jeg er taknemmelig over for Professor Lenski for at tage tid til at bedømme Darwin Devolves. Hans kommentarer vil tillade interesserede læsere hurtigt at vurdere den relative styrke af argumenterne vendt mod bogens tese.Selv om det ikke var emnet for hans første post, vil jeg begynde med Lenskis diskussion af det eksempel hvormed jeg indleder bogen - isbjørnens genmateriale - fordi det illustrerer nogle princippper, som vil være nyttige, som vi skrider frem. For læsere, som ikke har tid til at læse indtil slutningen, er her et par konklusioner, de kan tage med hjem:At the beginning of Darwin Devolves I discuss work by researchers who compared the genome of the brown bear (Ursus arctos) with that of the polar bear (Ursus maritimus). Those species separated from a common ancestor hundreds of thousands of years ago. By analyzing the DNA sequence data, the researchers were able to determine the genes whose selection most strongly adjusted the polar bear lineage to a frigid environment. One of those genes, called APOB, is involved in fat metabolism. As I wrote:In fact,. What's more, since many genes had multiple mutations, I noted that. I used this example to set the stage for the main theme of the book, that Darwin's mechanism works chiefly by degrading pre-existing genetic information, which sometimes helps a species survive.Echoing blogged arguments by his lesser-known co-authors of the appalling review of my book in Science, Professor Lenski points out (as I repeatedly do in the book) that the computer analysis is a prediction that a particular mutation will or won't be damaging; it is not an experimental demonstration. In other words, the prediction could be wrong. Further, the program categorizes mutations into just three categories: probably damaging, possibly damaging, and benign. (Benign means simply that, as far as the program can tell, no damage has been done to the protein by that change;.) Thus, as he stresses, the program is not set up to detect if in fact some new function had been gained by the protein. He goes on to emphasize that the polar bear is superbly adapted to its high-fat diet - much better in that regard than the brown bear. All of which, I happily agree, is true.But then, without benefit of supporting data, Lenski waxes strongly optimistic. He quotes an author of the study and then stresses his own view in bold face:Lenski is almost certainly wrong about the bolded text. Here's why. In 1995 researchers knocked out (destroyed) one of the two copies of the APOB gene in a mouse model - the same gene as has been selected in polar bears. Although APOB is itself involved in the larger process of the transport of cholesterol, mice missing one copy of the APOB gene actually had lower plasma cholesterol levels than mice with two copies. (Mice missing both copies died before birth.) What's more, the researchers noted that ""When fed a diet rich in fat and cholesterol, heterozygous mice were protected from diet-induced hypercholesterolemia.""The researchers admitted they did not know how it all came together - how that effect on the complex cholesterol-transport system resulted from breaking the gene. Nonetheless, there is no ambiguity about the mouse results.Deletion of one copy of the gene may have made the process of cholesterol removal more efficient, as Rasmus Nielsen speculated above about the polar bear,Just to be extra clear about the relevance of the mouse results to the interpretation of the polar bear genome, let me state my reasoning explicitly. Given the experimental results with mice, it is most parsimonious to think APOB is broken or blunted in polar bears.Given that computer analysis also estimated the APOB mutations in the polar bear as likely to be damaging, it is most reasonable to think the activity of the protein has been blunted by the mutations.Thus there is no good reason to speculate about possible new activities of the coded protein in the polar bear. Rather, the simplest hypothesis is that the mutations in the polar bear lineage that were judged by computer analysis as likely to be damaging did indeed blunt the activity of the APOB protein in that species - that is, made it less effective. That molecular loss gave rise to a happy, higher-level phenotypic result - an increased tolerance of polar bears for their high fat diet.The caveats mentioned above by Professor Lenski - about how computer-assignment of a mutation as ""damaging"" is not a guarantee, and that the protein may have secretly gained some positive new function - are correct. He is also quite right to say that without detailed biochemical and other experiments we cannot know for sure how the change affected the protein and the larger system at the molecular level. Nonetheless, computer methods of analyzing mutations are widely used because they are generally accurate. And they do not suddenly lose their accuracy when I cite their results.The APOB gene is exceptional in having such detailed research done on it. Most other genes haven't been so closely investigated. Nonetheless, in the absence of positive evidence to doubt a prediction for a specific case, the results of the computer analysis should be tentatively accepted for other genes to which it has been applied as well.(One of Lenski's co-reviewers actually talked himself into thinking that ""it is entirely possible that none of the 17 most positively selected genes in polar bears are 'damaged.'"" Now there's a great opportunity for someone to make a few dollars with a friendly wager.)I'd like to highlight one final critical point. Let me set it up with a homey analogy. When I was 14 I worked weekends at McDonald's, and sometimes I'd be assigned to operate the milkshake machine. The machine was broken down each night for cleaning. One of my tasks early in the morning before opening was to reassemble its parts. There were maybe a dozen parts to put together - sprockets, clamps, gaskets, and such. Shakes were very popular back then (mid 1960s) and made many customers happy for a while. Nonetheless, the function of the parts of a shake machine is not ""to make people happy."" The function of a sprocket or a clamp isn't even ""to make a milkshake."" Rather, they have lower-level mechanical duties that are subservient to the overarching higher purposes of the systems.The same is true of APOB.Thus the fact that cholesterol might be cleared more efficiently in polar bears does not at all mean that APOB hasn't been degraded, any more than breaking the off-switch of a shake machine so that it works continuously throughout lunch hour means some new improved function was added.In both Darwin Devolves and my Quarterly Review of Biology paper on which it is based, I repeatedly stressed the need to look beneath higher-level, phenotypic changes to associated underlying molecular-level mutations. Did they help by constructing or by degrading what I termed Functional Coded elemenTs (FCTs)?There is every reason to think that's what occurred in the evolution of the examples I cite in Darwin Devolves, definitely including the magnificent Ursus maritimus. The more effective clearance of its cholesterol allows the polar bear to thrive on a diet of seal blubber, but it is the result of a mutation that breaks or blunts APOB."

82,2,"Leader of the Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Seyyed Ali Khamenei says an upcoming US-devised deal on the Palestine issue is doomed to fail and will “never materialize.”

Ayatollah Khamenei made the comments during a speech at Imam Khomeini’s Mosalla Grand Prayer Grounds in Tehran on Wednesday after leading Eid al-Fitr’s prayers there. The Islamic festivities known as Eid al-Fitr mark the end of the holy fasting month of Ramadan.

The Leader further rejected US President Donald Trump’s yet-to-be-unveiled deal on the decades-long Israeli-Palestinian conflict as “a betrayal of the Muslim world.”

Ayatollah Khamenei further denounced the Bahraini regime for agreeing to host a conference, where Washington is set to unveil parts of the plan later this month.

All Palestinian groups — along with the United Nations and several other countries — have boycotted the event.

Ayatollah Khamenei described the Palestinian cause against Israeli occupation as the “number one issue” on the agenda of the Islamic world, thanking those who have voiced opposition to the so-called “peace” deal and the relevant event in Bahrain.

Elsewhere, Ayatollah Khamenei congratulated the Iranian nation on the occasion of Eid al-Fitr, expressing his gratitude to people for their mass participation in the nationwide rallies marking International Quds Day on the last Friday of Ramadan.

Later in the day, the Leader received a gathering of Iranian authorities, ambassadors of Muslim countries, and people of various social spectra in a meeting marking Eid al-Fitr.

In a speech addressed to that meeting, Ayatollah Khamenei condemned efforts by certain Muslim states to advance the goals of the United States and Israel.

“[On the contrary,] the Islamic Republic has, from the very beginning, laid emphasis on defending the Palestinian people and stood up to global arrogance,” the Leader said, emphasizing Iran’s resolve to “keep up this steadfastness.”

The Leader further reaffirmed the Islamic Republic’s proposal for a referendum to be held “within the framework of Palestine’s government system” among the residents of this land, including Muslims, Jews, Christians as well as the Palestinian refugees, who have been displaced from their homeland by the occupiers.

Ayatollah Khamenei further specified this year’s Eid al-Fitr message as unity and solidarity among Muslim countries as well as a return to the notion of “the Muslim Ummah.”

The Leader, meanwhile, cautioned the world’s Muslim nations against the enemies’ plots to sow discord among them and push their countries into chaos and conflict.

As examples of such hostile attempts, Ayatollah Khamenei referred to the situation in Libya — which has been the scene of rivalry between two governments — as well as Yemen, which has been the target of a bloody Saudi-led military campaign for more than four years."
83,2,"Syria - Western Media Glorification Of Syrian Jihadist Is A Sign That The War Is Far From Its End Western media currently publish glorifying obituaries for a Syrian 'rebel' who is know for extreme sectarianism and for being a member of a Jihadi group that is aligend with al-Qaeda. The Associated Press, the BBC, the Guardian and analysts all write of Abdul Baset al-Sarout who yesterday died of wounds he received two days earlier when his group attacked Syrian government forces. Abdul Baset al-Sarout, 27, rose to fame as a goalkeeper for his home city of Homs and won international titles representing his country. When peaceful protests broke out against Mr. al-Assad in 2011, Mr. al-Sarout led rallies and became known as the “singer of the revolution” for his ballads. When Syria slid into civil war, Mr. al-Sarout took up arms. He led a unit of fighters against government forces and survived the government siege of Homs. A Syrian footballer who became a symbolic figure in the rebellion against the country’s president, Bashar al-Assad, has died of wounds suffered in a battle with government forces.

May his soul rest in peace There were rumours that Mr Sarout subsequently pledged allegiance to the so-called Islamic State. He denied this, but admitted he had considered the idea when IS seemed the only force strong enough to combat the government - a sign of how the rebel cause disintegrated. “He was both a popular figure, guiding the rebellion, and a military commander,” said Maj. Jamil al-Saleh, leader of the rebel group Jaish al-Izza, in which Mr. al-Sarout was a commander. “His martyrdom will give us a push to continue down the path he chose and to which he offered his soul and blood as sacrifice.” 

The above may leave readers with a few questions. Q: What 'ballads' did the ""singer of the revolution” sing? A March 2012 video shows al-Sarout taking to the stage at a demonstration in the part of Homs that he and other 'rebels' occupied. Abdul Baset al-Sarout chants slogans each of which the crowd then repeats: We ar all Jihadis.

Homs has made its decision.

We will exterminate the Alawites.

And the Shiites have to leave. Sarout appeared as a main persona in a pro-Jihadi propagada documentary that mainstream media hyped: Filmed during two years, from 2011 to 2013, this by turns exhilarating and devastating documentary tracks some key players in the resistance against Bashir al-Assad's regime. The foremost is Abdul Baset al-Sarout, once a goalkeeper for Syria's national youth football team, he is a charismatic character who starts out leading chants in the streets in 2011 and ends up becoming a battle-worn leader for the militia. Q: What were the 'flaws' the 'true legend' al-Sarout allegedly had? While al-Sarout did not mind suicide bombings and called for mass murder of people of other beliefs his drug fuelled style of life was not pure enough to be accepted by the Islamic State. From a 2014 interview (vid) with the 'charismatic character' recorded shortly before the Syrian Arab Army removed al-Sarout and his group from Homs: Our blame for the Islamic State and Jabhat al-Nusra comes with love because we know that these two groups are not politicized and have the same goals as us and are working for god and that they care about Islam and Muslims. Unfortunately some among them consider us kafers (apostates) and drug addicts. But god willing we will work with them shoulder to shoulder when we leave here. And we are not Christians or Shia to be scared of suicide belts and car bombs. We consider these things as a strengths of ours and god willing they will be just that. This message is to the Islamic State and our brothers in Jabhat al-Nusra that when we come out (of Homs) we will all be one hand to fight Christians and not have internal fights among ourselves We want to take back the lands that have been filthied by the regime, that were entered and taken over by Shias and apostates. Where did those 'rumors' come from that al Sarout pledged allegiance to ISIS? In December 2014, after he was kicked out of Homs, Abdul Basset Sarout himself said that he was joining the Islamic State: Joshua Landis @joshua_landis - 17:56 utc - 26 Dec 2014 Star of movie ""Return to Homs,"" Abdul Basset Sarout, announces he joins ISIS - http://www.aksalser.com/... Sarot had recently published a video clip denying the news of his martyrdom and confirming that he was preparing for a new step soon, in what appeared to be the intention of joining the ""Daash"". What is this group Jaysh al-Izza to which the Islamic State wanna-be al-Sarout belonged? Rejected by the Islamic State al-Sarout's stayed on as a member of Jaysh al-Izza, led by former Maj. Jamil al-Saleh. The group received money, anti-tank weapons and other material from the United States under President Obama's secret Operation Timber-Sycamore. Then as now the 'moderate rebels' of Jaysh al-Izza operate as a 'Free Syrian Army' front group to funnel foreign supplies to al-Qaeda. Russian air strikes in northwest Syria which Moscow said targeted Islamic State fighters hit a rebel group supported by Western opponents of President Bashar al-Assad on Wednesday, wounding eight, the group’s commander said. 

...

“The northern countryside of Hama has no presence of ISIS at all and is under the control of the Free Syrian Army,” Major Jamil al-Saleh, who defected from the Syrian army in 2012, told Reuters via Skype. Saleh said his group had been supplied with advanced anti-tank missiles by foreign powers opposed to Assad. Jamil al-Saleh, Abdul Baset al-Sarout's commander who claimed that ""the northern countryside of Hama"" was ""under the control of the Free Syrian Army"", recently appeared in another video. His troops wear shoulder patches with al-Qaeda flags. Within Syria @WithinSyriaBlog - 10:09 utc - 4 Jun 2019 New video released by Jaysh al-Izza supporters shows the group's commander Jamil al-Saleh visiting his troops, one of them is wearing a batch of al-Qaeda. Jaysh al-Izza was always a proxy of al-Nusra Front\HTS. Yet it received US support, now Turkish support. A new video, published yesterday, shows 'moderate rebels' with similar al-Qaeda shoulder patches beheading a Syrian soldier they had earlier taken prisoner. That the 'western' mainstream media and their sectarain analysts continue to glorify al-Sarout, despite all that is known about him and his group, is a sure sign that the war the 'west' wages through its Jihadi proxies against Syria is far from over.

Twas the Night Before Marxmas

 



No aspect of our lives will be left untouched by Obama’s fundamental transformation of America. As we have seen, not even classics like “Twas the Night Before Christmas” are off limits from liberal reformers. Here is a new version of the poem for the Age of Obama, compliments of AC:

 



Twas the night before Marxmas, and all through the grad,

 Not a worker was working; the market’s too bad.

 The stockings were empty and that’s how they’d stay,

 Because presents were rationed and coal went away.

 

The children were thinking of the people’s school,

 Where they praise Comrade Chairman because that was the rule.

 Momma was trying for kid number six,

 To bump up her check and pay for her fix.

 

When out in the Square there arose such a clatter,

 Was another spy caught? What could be the matter?

 I expected to see another traitor denounced,

 But instead, a man, his beard quite pronounced.

 

The moon shone bright on the snow on each home,

 Global warming had chilled us, right down to the bone.

 When, what my wandering eyes did see,

 Was a detachment of men from the NKVD!

 

With a full bearded leader, his face not quite dark,

 I knew in a moment it was Comrade Marx!

 More rapid than eagles his enforcers came,

 They knocked on my door and demanded my name.

 

They yelled “Open up, Comrade!” in their angry tone,

 Suspicious that Bibles might be in my home.

 They kicked in the door and what did they see,

 But a computer, its browser on Moonbattery!

 

I said, “My neighbor, he did that, if you want to know.

 “Me, myself, I love Barry O!

 “For him? I cast ballots at least counting eight.

 “My neighbor? Likes Limbaugh, and thinks he is great.”

 

His Tok, how it twinkled, his men, how they stared,

 Looking at nothing, the whole flat was bare.

 He said, “Well done, comrade!” with a pleasing tone,

 “We go roust that bagger right out of his home.

 

“Your word is enough, all charges will hold.

 “Traitor be shipped down Siberian road.

 “For praying to Jesus and clinging to guns.

 “And keeping money he makes from a business that runs.

 

“For voting for Mitt and LTC West.

 “We shall give this traitor his much needed rest!”

 With a snap of his fingers he beckoned his guard,

 But not before filling my EBT card.

 

They spoke not a word as they went to work,

 As they kicked in the door and arrested the jerk.

 Handcuffed and bleeding, and dragged out in fright,

 And thrown into a trunk in the middle of the night.

 

He sprang to his ZIL, and put it in gear,

 Taking my neighbor away to just disappear.

 But I heard him exclaim, just as off he drove,

 “Merry Marxmas to all, and stay poor, dear tov!”



Comrade spymyeyes ,

 Was this photo taken before or after ol'papasantoMarx punched the Aryan nation in the face for it's heresies?



Comrade slacker,



I know not when this photo of our ""original"" dear leader was taken, but it does bring a gap-toothed smile to my vodka-stained lips everytime I see it!



BTW, comrade is the same word like Italian camerata and German Kamerad. Both these words were used by fascists and nazis, respectively.



Thinking these days. The biggest damage that nazism did to the mankind is not what books enlist. It is the fact that it legitimized communism. Without nazism, communism would have fallen very quick. It was indeed vastly unpopular.



This is not to belittle damages that books report. Also, it's clear that both are fruits of the same tree. At its roots stands Malthus, and this is very little talked about.



You know you're spending too much time on The Cube™ when...



...You have a dog whom you occasionally call ""Puppy"" as an endearment, and one day you call him ""Pupovich.""



...You sit at the dinner table complaining about friends who've given up their lives to spend all their time on Facebook playing Gulagville--and you meant to say, ""Farmville.""



...Red Square is no longer thought of as a place in Moscow, but a person in your life. 



...You find yourself giggling at Doctor Zhivago, or you did until November 2008, and now the movie just plain scares you. 



...Every time you see a distraught Muslim woman on TV, you say, ""Hey look, everybody, it's Flat Fatima!""



...Every time you see a mime, you think of Mikael Rudolph.



You're spending too much time on The Cube when pictures of Obama and those of his administration are the largest memory files on your computer.



....when reading a map you see the city of Krasnodar and say ""I know that guy!""



You catch yourself whistling the old Soviet National anthem.

You have a bumper sticker on you Lada that reads, ""My other car is a Zil""

You refer to The President as ""Dear Leader.

You start to think Pinky is hot.



THIS IS NOT MY FAULT!! You are all behaving braggadociosingly of your time within the Cubbery, and I, your dear Fraulein, have been trapped, locked out and excluded to the gulag for 3 weeks, unable and incapable of unlocking the toilet door. I denounce all this post as discriminatory and racist!

But have a Merry Winter Solstice to all...



A comrade gives you a Rubik's cube for Marxmas and you return it to the store because it is defective - the dots on the faces are all colors.



You watch CNN and read the NY Times only to look for stories you can satirize.



When introduced to a new acquaintance, you ask how many child persons are associated with her family unit and where her collective is located.



You write ""womyn"" without realizing it.



When you see an empty mason jar, you wonder what happened to the brain inside.



You start to snicker whenever someone mentions ""beets"".



Pssssst - I have secretly placed a People's Tracking Device inside Rammstein's CubeCollar™ - there is a very special place in the Gulag for cats, you know...



Hopefully he doesn't read this. He tends to hang out mostly in the People's Karaoke section.



--You keep trying to learn Russian (even when you forget all the grammar as soon as you learn it)



--You find yourself pulling out your old books from college for research....when you were a Marxist wannabe.



--You start feeling less angry at your stupid liberal relatives, and more amused, since you can use their prattle for Cube material!



Comrades

I want to confess. I have been overcubing to the the extent that I gave shovels to all my Union Officers at our retiree Marxmas party so they could share in glorious experience by truly laboring for the Collective. Their response something to behold, but you had to be there.

Otherwise, you know you've been on the Cube too much when even after your conversion you place your old worn figures of the Holy Family on top of your new model of Lenin's tomb.



You know that you are spending too much time on ThePeoplesCube if you call your second degree Reeducation.



I know we are paid the big bucks to be cynical, sarcastic and brutally sardonic but sometimes I feel sorry for old John. Not all the time, mind you, just some times. The old boy has been dealt a tough hand.



Dearest People's Comrade,



I am most appreciative of your intervention on some of my earlier posts, acting as a ""troll intervenor"" only when I asked for it. For this, I am most appreciative and you did add a most welcome impetus to them, turning everything after that into a joyous celebration of proggism. For this, you have my utmost respect.



Now I know your are truly jiving me and, for this, and the way you did it, I am in awe! Yes, poor, poor John! Yeah, that's the ticket! Good one, Comrade!



Clearly, Comrade Red Square, you have DNA links to Salvador Dali.



Oh yeah, and that other guy, Magritte.



Nice.



When you use our warped style of satire in a political discussion with your progressive friends and they have no clue you are making fun of them. Moreover, they think your viewpoints are brilliant. An example would be when they think it is a ""good start"" or ""time to set an example"" at the suggestion of disarming the Secret Service and making the White House a ""gun free zone"", or they applaud your idea of applying your local school's ""zero tolerance"" weapons and violence speech codes to not only the students, but also to the faculty and curriculum, especially in history and social studies.



...you look for the ""Prog Off"" or ""Quote"" button before responding to an article in the comment section of a non-cube news site.



You know you've spent too much time on the Cube when the satire becomes real (note the order of the wording.)



When you see a squirrel and think ""Craptek!""



You hear this Frank Turner song on the radio hear shovel & instantly think of the Cube .







you spent definitely too much time pressing your face against the window of the cube forum, when the idea strikes you to join that glorious collective ^^



greetings from the European Soviet Republik of Germany





this is just a test message from a test cat!



Comrade! Your anti-Social attitude has been noted. There is no such thing as too much time spent furthering the socialist collective future! You have two channels to choose from now. Channel one is glorious Pravda of the peoples party 24/7. Channel two is... never mind what channel 2 is comrade! Turn back to channel one! You have been warned!

Alas...to my maiden contribution to this institution of mind-weary outcasts.

 

I recently chanced upon this creative work of analysis and back-tracked it here. There is one significant indicator here in this mind-numbing depiction of reality that is common to all demonRATs of the little 'd' party. 





 



It is identified here as the ""PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY NODE"". In 'normal persons', those whose intellect is driven by rationale decision-making as opposed to emotion, we would find said node to be much more significant in size and with a multiple synapse structure that provides a widely-dispersed linkage to all primary brain receptor areas.

 

In this particular brain frontal lobe one may readily observe an anomaly. Even though in civil society the continuing success of such societies is directly dependent upon the assumption of ""the ethic of personal responsibility"" (as a far-reaching influence of behaviors and behavioral reactions), in this distorted roadmap of insanity we find it to not only be miniscule in size, but to be under constant physical pressure. Progressive hereditary influences now start to make sense. 



If you understand that the color red represents those areas of the liberal brain that we call metastatic centers, that help to spread cancerous lesions throughout the brain, then some

things become very obvious. They are that the ""KARL MARX SHRINE"", the largest red-area, presents as the modern-era origin of Socialist/Communist theology influences that erodes the 'normal' belief system. As such, it has impacted the frontal lobe panic button and by virtue of it's destructive nature has broken it down into three distinct and separate areas. 



 



A modern-era Manmade Global Warming Panic Center that is now totally surrounded by an 'in-progress' outer membrane of orange with a mix of red, malignant stage 3B lymphoma growths. Research is ongoing despite great resistance from patient groups.



 

What is not so obvious, except upon very close inspection, is just how the pressure building within that particular Panic Center has already forced cancerous cells outward an in-between the Moral Relativity and Smarter Than Thou areas to seed a brand new, albeit miniscule now, frontal lobe malformation right up against the dormant Personal Responsibility Node. A potentially catastrophic event!

 

Lastly, here is also a third, sad observation to be made by this latest of updated brain analysis pictorials. It is the presence of THBS (The Head-Bangers Syndrome) made all too apparent by the front-lobe swelling at the Smarter Than Thou impact point, which - as anyone may observe - has become flattened by the accumulated build-up of scar-tissue.



Without delving further into the liberal mind, or lack thereof, it is fair to conclude that if we can draw some corrective therapy to these primary areas of concern we will have made significant progress into the purging of the rubber-stamping mindset in our society.

 Ahhhh! The Peoples Cube. A breath of fresh air in a garden of stinkweed. Refreshing indeed and for one whose journey in life has brought him into the shadow of mile marker 80, I'm so damned happy I could fart! Being a retired mixed-specialties physician, I'm one of the rare few still around who can lay claim to such distnction. Although my practice was limited to patients of the female persuasion(in Urology, Proctology, and OB/GYN, sexing my newer patients in the years just prior to retirement became quite a strain on me. The last of those NEW patients I had was a tranny. It introduced itself to me as...""Hi Doc. I'm Phyliss, but you can call me Phil.""who complained that she/he was no longer able to attain erection. I gave her/him/it a complimentary bottle of brandy (as the Christmas holidays were upon us)and sent her/him/it on her/his/it's way....WHEW...this stuff gets dizzying.Alas...to my maiden contribution to this institution of mind-weary outcasts.I recently chanced upon this creative work of analysis and back-tracked it here.

85,2,"It is clear to us now that Islam is not a religion. It is an evil, oppressive ideology with governmental, judicial, educational, militaristic, and societal aspects to it which are shrouded behind the veil of religion to give it legitimacy.

As such, it is completely incompatible with our Constitution and the nature of our free society.

We hear Muslims saying they want to destroy us. Now a CIA operative says the same thing. What else do we need for liberals and Democrats to understand what the Muslims are going to do?

Ex CIA operative Clare Lopez has said for years that extremist groups like the Muslim Brotherhood have infiltrated the Obama administration and are carrying out their agendas through U.S. foreign policy. Lopez has extensive experience with Middle East culture and the religion of Islam. Therefore she gave her reasons why Muslims are extremely dangerous to our way of life.

Speaking about why there is an Islamic prosecution of non-Muslim religious minorities she said: “The faith of not being Muslim, that is why those groups are executed- because they are not Muslim.”

She then added: “What we are seeing today is a continuation of what was begun at the earliest times after the beginning of Islam and the death of Muhamed.”

Nice Speech, hopefully, people wake up and defend our lands from Islam the worst disease of mankind. You must listen to this. Helps to understand what the Muslims are really about. There’s even mention of the liberal left. The USA is heading down the path of other extinct cultures and religions due to the overwhelming presence of radical Muslims, and what their beliefs are.

Wake up, people! We must save our country by opening our eyes, acknowledging what the problem is, and defending ourselves.

86,2,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Members of the U.S. Congress, including some of President Donald Trump’s fellow Republicans as well as Democrats, are preparing legislation seeking to block his plan for $8 billion in weapons sales to Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Jordan, congressional aides and lawmakers said on Tuesday.

The first measures could be introduced within days, congressional aides said.

Declaring a national emergency because of tensions with Iran, the Trump administration informed congressional committees on May 24 that it was going ahead with the 22 military deals, circumventing a long-standing precedent for lawmakers to review major weapons sales.

The decision angered members of both parties, who worried that Trump’s decision to blow through the “holds” process would eliminate Congress’ ability to prevent not just Trump but future presidents from selling weapons where they liked.

The array of military products cleared for sale by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo included offensive equipment like precision-guided munitions, mortars and fighter jet engines, some of which would take many months to be produced and shipped, which lawmakers said belied the administration’s contention that it was addressing an emergency.

Some of the licenses would allow U.S. defence contractors like Raytheon Co and Boeing Co to run production lines in Saudi Arabia.

In the House of Representatives, which is controlled by Democrats, lawmakers were considering a bill that would require the 22 licenses approved by the administration to be pulled back and resubmitted through the regular notification procedure, including a 30-day congressional review, Democratic congressional aides said.

House members also may seek to rewrite the Arms Export Control Act of 1976 to impose tighter restrictions on the use of the “emergency authority” provision, tightening the loophole the Trump administration used to justify the sale so it could only be used for “true emergencies,” aides said.

House members said they expected any measure would have support from members of both parties.

“There’s a bipartisan resolve that we need to re-evaluate our relationship with Saudi Arabia, most especially the weapons that we sell them,” Representative Joaquin Castro, a Democratic member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, told Reuters.

Members of Congress had been blocking sales of offensive military equipment to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates for months, angry about the huge civilian toll from their air campaign in Yemen, as well as human rights abuses such as the murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi at a Saudi consulate in Turkey.

When Pompeo announced the sales in May, Representative Mike McCaul, the top Republican on the Foreign Affairs panel, called the action “unfortunate” and likely to damage future White House interactions with Congress.

In the Senate, congressional aides said, lawmakers planned to file “resolutions of disapproval,” setting up votes on each of the weapons deals approved by the Trump administration.

Senator Bob Menendez, the top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, a close ally of Trump’s, told the Washington Post that they would work together to introduce 22 resolutions.

The Arms Export Control Act gives Congress the right to vote on whether to stop major weapons sales by passing a resolution of disapproval.

Opponents of the weapons sale plan said strong bipartisan support for such resolutions would send a strong message to the administration - as well as defence contractors and the three countries - that Congress was unhappy about the process.

Backers of the plan also said it was possible, given the level of congressional anger over Trump’s use of the emergency declaration, that some of the resolutions would garner the two-thirds majorities in the Senate and House needed to override a Trump veto.

Lawmakers could also include legislation related to the weapons sale in a must-pass bill such as the annual National Defense Authorization Act, a massive defence policy measure currently making its way through Congress.

The U.S. military has cited what it sees as a threat of potential attack by Iran to deploy hundreds of troops to the Middle East, in addition to Patriot missiles, bombers and the accelerated movement of a carrier strike group.

However, administration officials have also sought to reassure members of Congress, and the public, that they are not rushing to war with the Islamic republic."
87,2,"not one mention was made of it during the 75th D-Day anniversary commemorations in Northern France

Operation Bagration was the D-Day of the Eastern Front. In scope, size, scale and impact, it was a remarkable feat of arms unmatched in WWII.Crucially, Overlord (D-Day) and Bagration were planned and undertaken as part of a coordinated effort on the part of the Grand Alliance to break the back of German resistance in Europe with a determination that was equally held by the Soviets, British and Americans to force the unconditional surrender of Hitler's Germany.In his book Stalin's Wars Geoffrey Roberts reveals that,The Soviets were informed of the approximate date of D-Day in early April and, on 18 April, Stalin cabled Roosevelt and Churchill that,Though both operations were of immense military and strategic importance,, with air attacks on enemy artillery positions and concentrations, guided by partisan units operating behind German lines.The main offensive began on 23 June along aOperation Bagration was designed to complement D-Day, to effect the liberation of the Soviet territory from the Nazis and destroy the Wehrmacht as a serious fighting force in the East.As British historian and author David Reynolds points out:He goes on:The famed Soviet journalist and author, Vasily Grossman, whose collection of wartime journalism, A Writer At War, is a classic work that should be required reading for those interested in the reality of war and conflict, describes with customary force and power the human toll of the Soviet offensive:The valor and courage of the 156,000 troops who landed on the Normandy beaches on 6 June 1944 is not in question, nor is that of the thousands of sailors, airmen, and airborne troops who also took part in D-Day. Operation Overlord was and will likely remain the largest amphibious military assault ever mounted. In terms of its ambition, planning and the coordination of the combined military forces of the multiple nations involved, it deserves the place in military history that it commands.Wind things forward 75 years and the parlous quality of statesmanship in the West, with the open violation of the spirit of the Grand Alliance between East and West that is enshrined in Stalin's telegram, has never been more lamentable. For example,The notion that the men who gave their lives on D-Day, and thereafter in Europe on the way to war's end in 1945, did so in order to give birth to a continent dependent on Washington and in fear of Moscow, is preposterous.A Europe liberated from fascism but divided by a Cold War that shattered forever the hopes for a lasting and enduring peace of equals - for global stability and cooperation reflected in the war's Grand Alliance between East and West - is nothing to celebrate. It reminds us that, although so much was sacrificed and won by so many during the war, so much was thrown away and lost by so few after it.Operation Bagration and Operation Overlord should never be spoken of separately. Both were mounted at the same stage in the war by a Grand Alliance that contained within it the seeds of a future that, if it had come to pass, would've met the scale of the sacrifice needed to emerge victorious.The last word goes to Vasily Grossman:"

Taking this idea even further, Professor Kurgman has pioneered a new trend in social science called ""Futuristic Revisionism"" that deals with ""updating news reporting with more accurate and less biased information in real time"" as the events unfold. Besides the benefit of helping the unwashed masses to develop the correct view of world events, this approach is meant to create a desired view of events for journalists and historians of the distant future, when all the memory of current events will have been completely erased (e.g., next election cycle)

 The Zionist war-machine then developed a clever trick called ""boomerang rockets"" - launched from Israel into Lebanon, hundreds of them boomeranged back into Israel, fooling the world community about their true origin.

 As the war drew to a close, The Hezbollah leader, Sheik Hassan Nasrallah, in a powerful speech, pleaded for a better future: ""When we let freedom ring, when we let it ring from every village and every hamlet, from every state and every city, we will be able to speed up that day when all of God's children, black men and white men, Jews and Gentiles, Protestants and Catholics, will be able to join hands and sing, ""Free at last! Free at last! Thank God Almighty, we are free at last!""



The post WWII culture of not wanting to interfere with the Soviet Union's expansion of international revolution reaped rich rewards for all of Eastern Europe, and also for many fortunate citizens of Central America, Africa, and Asia. Similarly, we expect that the drive to not interfere in the Middle East (except for stopping Zionist aggression with ceasefires) will also benefit millions by way of exporting multicultural religious ideals throughout the region, into Europe, and across the oceans.



 Please note that this may be the last time we hear from Professor Kurgman, as he has decided to terminate such enjoyable activity as writing because ""it is morally wrong to enjoy any activity and feel happy when others suffer."" 



It is wrong to be happy when children in Amerikkka are starving under the merciless forces of capitalism, when Zionists continue their extermination of the indigenous Sun People, when Republican Christian zealots are imposing a theocracy on us. 



Instead, the Professor decided to join the world in its immense suffering and to suffer along with it and on behalf of all those others who are suffering. And we invite you, dear reader, to suffer with him. If you are moral, you will. 

 We can never underestimate the importance of proper screening of individuals who narrate history for the masses - from news services and talk shows to school teachers and entertainers. As the great progressive leader Joseph Stalin may have said, ""It's not what really happens, it's what we write about it that matters.""To our credit we have a firm grip on all of the above.One of the most prominent members of the academic community in this respect is Professor Kurgman, PhD, PhD, PhD, who has kindly written for the People's Cube a brief yet masterful summary of the recent conflict in the Middle East.Not only does it correctly capture the way the events were covered by world's progressive media, it is also destined to enter the annals of history as the sole unquestionable resource for social scientists of the future.In the summer of 2006, the Zionist populace of Israel, spoiled by joint ventures with Intel and Motorola , and their biotechnology inventions (which were all stolen from the Islam anyway) unanimously decided, ""To hell with technology and commerce; we need to murder Lebanese civilian babies instead.""The Zionist war-machine then developed a clever trick called ""boomerang rockets"" - launched from Israel into Lebanon, hundreds of them boomeranged back into Israel, fooling the world community about their true origin.This went on for quite a while without much effect, until two Zionist soldiers ran into the unsuspecting arms of workers for the Social Service Agency Hezbollah , and said, ""Bring us into Lebanon, so that we can kill your civilian children for our religious rituals.""The Hezbollah workers bravely resisted, but the two Zionist soldiers prevailed, and invaded Lebanon. Immediately, other Zionist soldiers couldn't resist the temptation and they too began to invade Lebanon in droves, to slaughter children and steal body parts.Their Prime Minister Ehud Olmert proclaimed, ""To the Lebanese people, we say, 'We are not fighting so that you will offer us something. We are fighting to eliminate you.""Two days later, the Israeli-Lebanon border was jammed with cargo vehicles, returning with Muslim body parts to use in their so-called biotechnology inventions Disgusted by such disproportionate aggression, the civilized world from China to Nigeria to Russia and France objected - but as role models for peace , they were ignored.Meanwhile, the Zionist populace used this war as a pretext to loaf.By the thousands, the descended into their underground dens of sloth , and passed the time defiling the Koran and celebrating the Mossad's 2004 attack against school children in Beslan (disguised to make look like the work of Muslims).To quote one Zionist, ""We keep lots of matzo in our underground resorts for the Beslan celebration. Between that and our 2001 attack on the Americans, it's a continuous party down here.""But finally, Hezbollah struck back by holding peace rallies. All over Beirut, one could hear the cries of ""Peace Now!"" as Islamic clergy walked arm-in-arm with oppressed progressive minority groups such as The Transgender Alliance of Allah, The Rainbow Caliphate, Freegans for Islamic Justice, Purple Jihad, Green Party of Islam, as well as a variety of Sunni and Shia gay and lesbian organizations.The Zionist guns and bombs were no match of the Islamic Words of Peace. The invaders had to back down - but promised to return for more slaughter some other day. And so, the Social Service Agency Hezbollah went to work, gaining stature as they quietly helped the victims of the Zionist War Machine As the war drew to a close, The Hezbollah leader, Sheik Hassan Nasrallah, in a powerful speech, pleaded for a better future: ""When we let freedom ring, when we let it ring from every village and every hamlet, from every state and every city, we will be able to speed up that day when all of God's children, black men and white men, Jews and Gentiles, Protestants and Catholics, will be able to join hands and sing, ""Free at last! Free at last! Thank God Almighty, we are free at last!""The post WWII culture of not wanting to interfere with the Soviet Union's expansion of international revolution reaped rich rewards for all of Eastern Europe, and also for many fortunate citizens of Central America, Africa, and Asia. Similarly, we expect that the drive to not interfere in the Middle East (except for stopping Zionist aggression with ceasefires) will also benefit millions by way of exporting multicultural religious ideals throughout the region, into Europe, and across the oceans.

We will all suffer if Comrad Professor Kurgman cannot post new enlightened responses!

Many thanks for the kind welcome, Laika. My title, however, is figurative, as I am not an actual ""dog"", so to speak. I am merely a proud vehicle of propoganda for the Zionist ""Reich"" Wing, if you will (though even as a figurative Zionist Lapdog, I am, of course, no stranger to excessive bum-sniffing). Were I an actual dog, I would not have any time to post here, as surely my Zionist overlords would be utilizing me to chase after and maul defenseless Palestinian children, as part of the effort to drive this ancient and 100% peaceful people from the nation they have inhabited continuously since the dawn of mankind. (Unfortunately, like many Zionist Lapdogs, I cannot claim to be an EFFECTIVE vehicle of propoganda, especially in a bastion of Progressive thought such as this heralded forum). 



Ironically, you are correct that I did enjoy a garlic bagel for breakfast. That you were able to smell this from space is rather impressive.

90,2,"Whether you are prepping for the zombie apocalypse or the aftermath of a hurricane, self-defense is an important aspect of surviving any disaster.

Everyone has their preference as to what qualifies as the best survival weapon. History has proven the rifle to be the best all-purpose firearm to face a variety of combat and self-defense scenarios.

However, a rifle should only be part of what many preppers refer to as a layered defense system. It doesn’t matter if you are bugging out or sheltering, your need to arm yourself with a variety of weaponry, self-defense skills and training is the same. With that said, if you could have only one firearm in a survival situation it should be a quality rifle.

Though handguns and shotguns are also to be considered, a rifle will give you the most versatility for handling a variety of post-disaster needs from hunting to perimeter security. However, the options and varieties when it comes to choosing a survival rifle are nearly endless and even the most avid shooters and preppers struggle to choose a favorite.

Ultimately, the choice comes down to your own personal preferences and needs, as there is no such thing as the perfect survival rifle.

Does the air rifle have its place in today’s modern survival weapons cache, or is it of use only to those that want to shoot holes in paper or hit tin cans?

I believe that today’s air rifles do have their place in a modern survival weapons cache. This weapon can be used in small game hunting to hunt doves and other birds, rabbits, squirrel, and other small game animals.

There is also historical evidence that air rifles were used for a number of purposes. For example, the Girandon was used during the Lewis and Clark Expedition around 1780‘s. It held 22 rounds of 40 caliber bullets in a bullet reservoir.

This weapon had to be pumped over 1200 times to supply the air pressure needed to fire all the bullets one at a time. The bullet velocity of this weapon was equal to black powder rifles of this period (450-650fps).

Why Should You Use an Air Gun?

Here are some advantages associated with using an air rifle:
• Air rifles are very quiet – there are no loud bangs to scare off other game in the area.
• Easy to shoot – this weapon points nicely, and is not too heavy or large for the beginner or inexperienced shooter.
• It is an excellent, low cost training rifle with a simple design and cheap pellets.
• Air rifles come with iron sights and are very accurate. When used with a scope, the shooter gets very tight groups (where multiple pellets hit). When hunting with a scoped air rifle, small game may be taken safely up to 50 yards away.
• They are legal to own and shoot in most states. Because an air rifle uses only compressed air to fire the pellet (and not powder and a primer) most states do not classify them as firearms.
• Air rifles make an ideal stash gun. It can be buried in an air and water tight container with a couple of tins of pellets and then easily retrieved at a later time.
• Ammunition will not go bad. The only ammunition an air rifle needs is a pellet, nothing else. There are no cases, powder, or primers to worry about.

There is a sheer volume of different scopes and rifles on the market, so it can take some research to figure out which one will best match the types of shooting you intend to use it for.

Some hints can be followed though, so you could choose the best for you.

Read the article below to find them!

Overall, there are three basic steps to take when choosing a rifle scope:
• Start off by deciding what kind of shooting you plan to do.
• Look at basic scope features and make a list of those that will best meet your needs.
• Study manufacturers, models, and testimonials to determine which scope will give you the best quality for the lowest price. Speaking of price, since some scopes can cost hundreds to thousands of dollars. Rather than cover all possible options, I will focus on features that you can get on most scopes for under $500.00.

Грубо говоря, там, где девочке надо решить для поступления 9 задач из 10, мальчику будет достаточно решить только 8 задач.Директор гимназии объясняет это гендерными различиями - девочки взрослеют быстрее, и потому в 7 лет они немного старше мальчиков. Если не компенсировать эту разницу, получится столь же несправедливый экзамен, как если бы второклассников и первоклассников тестировали вместе.Детский омбудсмен в Пермском крае назвала уже случившееся «гендерной дискриминацией», аналогичного мнения придерживаются и другие политики с чиновниками. Насколько я вижу, осуждают политику гимназии и СМИ.Любопытно устроен наш мир - аналогичным образом детей дискриминируют при наборе в спортивные секции, устанавливая для мальчиков и девочек разные физические нормативы. Тем не менее эта практика никого не возмущает, ибо существует уже давно и считается нормой.Как полагаете, коллеги, прав ли в истории с проходными баллами директор гимназии? Какому типу равенства должен он отдать предпочтение: гендерному или фактическому?"
93,2,"Ever wondered what it would be like to protect your electronic devices or online accounts with something other than passwords? There are dozens of other proven authentication technologies out there, such as near-field communication (or NFC) tokens, USB keys, as well as biometric methods.

Even though stealing and recreating someone’s retinal pattern seems impossible to do even using today’s advanced technology, the portrayal of the retinal authentication technique in the movie is quite accurate. US government agencies have been using the method since the 1970s. Even though the technology has its own flaws, including the high price of hardware, it’s 200,000 times more accurate than fingerprint identification.

However, neither retinal scans nor the more advanced iris scan technology, which is good for the Pentagon or NASA, can be used by the average consumer who wants protection and security online at a reasonable price. The cost of hardware and a subscription for such technologies is too high and the whole concept is inconvenient for daily home use.

Instead, scientists have come up with a new idea (which is, by the way, is not entirely new). In 1844, the first telegraph message saying ""What hath God wrought"" was sent from the US Capitol to Baltimore, Maryland. The first telegraph operators developed their own style of typing – a unique “rhythm signature,” which was easy to identify.

Researchers say that the beauty of the method is not only in its use for initial authentication. It can be used continuously. So even if someone was able to impersonate the user during an email login sequence, the system can identify and block the bad guy later, if he tries to compose a new message, and his keystroke dynamics will not match those of the account owner.

So, with the growing use of AI and machine learning, we may very well see the rise of keystroke dynamics and other advanced authentication methods, which minimize the possibility of identity theft and help users stay safe online.

95,2,"Below is an approximation of this video’s audio content. To see any graphs, charts, graphics, images, and quotes to which Dr. Greger may be referring, watch the above video.

In my annual presentation last year, I ran through the 15 leading causes of death—exploring the latest science on the role diet may play in preventing, arresting, and even reversing the progression of some of our top 15 killers. (Or, if you recall, actually the top 16 killers). Since side effects from prescription drugs kill an estimated 106,000 Americans a year, the sixth leading cause of death, may actually be doctors.

And, that’s just from adverse drug reactions. Add in medical mistakes, which the Institute of Medicine estimates kills at least 44,000 Americans every year, and that brings doctors up to here. Throw in some hospital-acquired infections, and we’re talking maybe 187,000 Americans dead every year, and millions injured by medical care. Even preventive medicine kills… in its own way.

The best way to avoid the adverse effects of medical and surgical tests and treatments is not to avoid doctors, but to avoid getting sick in the first place. So, this year, I thought I’d run through the top dozen reasons people visit their doctors, to highlight some of the latest research in hopes of moving me lower down the list of common killers.

The #1 primary disease diagnosis at office visits is a respiratory disease, like the common cold. Most Americans report between two and three colds annually. This year, I featured evidence suggesting that simple water gargling is effective to prevent upper respiratory tract infections. This virtually cost-free modality would appreciably benefit people.

But that’s the problem: it’s “cost-free.” Nobody makes any money off it. That’s why you’ve probably never heard of this research. Whenever there’s a new drug or surgical procedure, you can be assured people will know about it, because there’s a profit motive—a corporate budget driving the promotion. That’s why you’ll never see an ad on TV for broccoli.

Nor for simple water, even though water may actually improve cognitive performance in school children, for example, because most kids end up at school in a state of mild dehydration. If you randomize kids to get a cup of water, you can improve their ability to think in school. Not with Ritalin or some new drug, but just plain water. Think how much drug companies could make if they could just sell sugar pills, but tell kids to take the fake pill with a cup of water. It’s like using exercise to treat ADHD. Effective, but we won’t hear about it because you can’t put it into a pill bottle for your stockholders.

Same with exercise—can also improve immunity, and decreases illness rates from respiratory infections. We’re talking a 25 to 50% reduction in sick days. Name one drug or supplement that can do that.

And, it doesn’t take much. Let kids run around for just six minutes, and you can boost the number of immune cells in their bloodstream by more than a third. In just six minutes!

At the other end of the life cycle, exercise may help prevent age-related immune decline. Sedentary women in their 70s have about a 50% chance of getting an upper respiratory illness every fall season. But, walk a half-hour a day, you may cut your risk down to 20%. And, the runners in the group got it under 10. Looks like exercise can make our immune system like five times more effective.

Now while regular physical activity improves immune function and lowers respiratory infection risk, sustained and intense exertion can have the opposite effect, forming a so-called J-shaped curve relationship. As you go from inactive to active your infection risk declines, but hardcore athletes that overtrain may increase their risk of infection.

How do you prevent that? Marathon runners consuming the equivalent of a teaspoon of nutritional yeast a day may not only cut respiratory infection risk in half but result in decreased confusion, fatigue, tension, anger – and my favorite – increased vigor… thanks to nutritional yeast. Yeast are one-celled fungi. What about multicellular fungi, mushrooms? If you split people into two groups, half eat their normal diet, and half eat their normal diet with cooked white button mushrooms every day for a week, no change in the control group. But after a week of mushrooms, antibody secretion jumps 50% and even stayed up there for a week after they stopped. Lots more detail in the video.

I just wanted to touch some of these areas. Mushrooms technically aren’t in the plant kingdom, so in theory the healthiest diet may not just be a plant-based diet, but a plant and fungus-based diet, though that sounds even less appetizing, I’m afraid.

Who wouldn’t want a boosted immune system? Well, millions of people suffer from autoimmune diseases, whose immune systems may already be a bit too active. So, might a healthy lifestyle make things worse, by boosting immune function further? No. Those who eat healthy appear protected from autoimmune diseases—given the extraordinary rarity of most autoimmune diseases among those following a traditional plant-based diet, for example. Before they Westernized their diet, not a single case of multiple sclerosis was diagnosed among 15 million people.

What about treating autoimmune diseases with a plant-based diet? Well, even a semi-vegetarian diet was found to successfully treat Crohn’s disease—better than any other intervention. The “best result in relapse prevention.” And, Crohn’s is an autoimmune disease. So, what about treating MS with diet?

The most frequently prescribed drug for multiple sclerosis is beta interferon, which can make you feel lousy, and cost $30,000 a year. But hey, it might be worthwhile if it actually worked. We learned last year that it does not seem to prevent or delay long-term disability.

That leaves chemo drugs like mitoxantrone, that causes irreversible heart damage in one out of every eight people who go on the drug, and treatment-related acute leukemia. It causes leukemia in nearly 1% of people who take it. But hey, MS is no walk in the park. If only there was a cheap, simple, safe, side effect-free solution that also just so happened to be the most effective treatment for MS ever described.

Dr. Roy Swank, who we lost at age 99, was a distinguished neurologist whose research culminated in over 170 scientific papers. But, I’ll just cut to the chase. He found that “in all probability, MS is caused largely by consumption of saturated animal fat.” He thought it was the sludging of the blood caused by even a single meal high in saturated fat that may clog tiny capillaries that feed our nerves. But, now we know animal fats can have all sorts of other adverse effects, such as inflammation—so, who knows what the actual mechanism may be.

Regardless, the results Dr. Swank published remain “the most effective treatment of multiple sclerosis ever reported in the peer review [medical] literature. In patients with early stage MS, 95% were without progression of their disease 34 years later after adopting his low saturated fat dietary program.” To date, no medication or invasive procedure has ever even come close to demonstrating such success. Doesn’t cost $30,000; doesn’t give you leukemia, and works—better!

Neurological problems are second on the list, but tend to be more common conditions, like headaches. Feel free to check out my videos on treating migraine headaches with lavender oil rubbed on the upper lip. And, hot sauce in the nose for cluster headaches? Believe me, it’s better than having cluster headaches.

I’ve talked about both preventing and treating Parkinson’s with a plant-based diet, since it’s a leading killer. But, the most common movement disorder isn’t Parkinson’s; it’s what’s called “essential tremor”—affecting 1 in 25 adults over 40, and up to 1 in 5 of those in their 90s, making it one of the most common neurological diseases. In addition to the potentially debilitating hand tremor, there can be other neuropsychiatric manifestations of the disease, including difficulty walking, and various levels of cognitive impairment.

What causes it? Well, there’s a group of neurotoxins that produce tremor, called beta carboline alkaloids. Harmane is one of the most potent of these tremor-producing neurotoxins. You expose people to these chemicals, and they develop a tremor. You take it away; the tremor disappears. What if we’re exposed long-term? Well, this recent study found those with essential tremor have much higher levels of this toxin in their bloodstream compared to those without tremor.

How did they get exposed to it? Primarily through meat: beef, chicken, and pork—and fish, actually. So, if this potent, tremor-producing neurotoxin is concentrated in cooked muscle foods, is meat consumption associated with a higher risk of essential tremor? Men who ate the most meat in this study had 21 times the odds of essential tremor. Just to put that in context, you go back to the original studies on smoking and lung cancer, smoking was only linked to, at most, 14 times the odds—not 21. That’s like a 2,000% increase in odds for this disabling brain disease.

Next on the list is circulatory diseases, the #1 killer of men and women. Among populations eating plant-based diets, MS was almost non-existent. What about heart disease?

Last year, the International Journal of Epidemiology reprinted this landmark article from the 50s that started out with a shocking statement: “In the African population of Uganda, coronary heart disease is almost non-existent.” Our #1 cause of death, almost nonexistent? What were they eating? Plantains and sweet potatoes, other vegetables, corn, millet, pumpkins, tomatoes, and, “green leafy vegetables are taken by all.” And, their protein almost entirely from plant sources. And, they had the cholesterol levels to prove it—similar to modern day plant-eaters.

Maybe the Africans were just dying early of other diseases, and so, never lived long enough to have a heart attack? No, here’s age-matched heart attack rates in Uganda versus St. Louis. Out of 632 autopsies in Uganda, one myocardial infarction. Out of 632 Missourians—same age and gender distribution—136 myocardial infarctions. More than a hundred times the rate of our #1 killer. In fact, they were so blown away, they did another 800 autopsies in Uganda, and still, just that one small healed infarct (meaning it wasn’t even the cause of death) out of 1,427 patients. Less than one in a thousand. Whereas in the U.S., it’s an epidemic.

This is a list of diseases commonly found here (and in populations that eat and live like the U.S.), but were rare, or even nonexistent, in populations eating diets centered around whole plant foods. These are among our most common diseases, like obesity. Hiatal hernia—one of the most common stomach problems; hemorrhoids and varicose veins—the most common venous disorders; colorectal cancer—the #2 cause of cancer death; diverticulosis—the #1 disease of the intestine; appendicitis—the #1 cause for emergency abdominal surgery; gallbladder disease—the #1 cause for nonemergency abdominal surgery; and ischemic heart disease—the commonest cause of death here, but a rarity in plant-based populations.

Heart disease is a choice. It’s like cavities. If you look at the teeth of people who lived over 10,000 years before the invention of the toothbrush, they pretty much had no cavities. Didn’t brush a day in their lives, never flossed. No Listerine, no Waterpik, yet no cavities. That’s because candy bars hadn’t been invented yet. Why do people continue to get cavities when we know they’re preventable though diet? Simple. Because the pleasure people derive from dessert may outweigh the cost and discomfort of the dentist. And, that’s fine!

Look, as long as people understand the consequences of their actions, as a physician, what more can I do? If you’re an adult, and decide the benefits outweigh the risks for you and your family, then go for it. I certainly enjoy the occasional indulgence (I’ve got a good dental plan). But, what if, instead of the plaque on your teeth, we’re talking about the plaque building up in your arteries? Another disease that can be prevented, by changing your diet.

Then, what are the consequences for you and your family? Now, we’re not just talking about scraping tartar. Now we’re talking life, and death. The most likely reason most of our loved ones will die is heart disease. It’s still up to each of us to make our own decisions as to what to eat and how to live. But, we should make our choices consciously, educating ourselves about the predictable consequences of our actions.

Atherosclerosis, hardening of the arteries, begins in childhood. By age ten, the arteries of nearly all kids have fatty streaks—the first stage of the disease. Then, the plaques start forming in our 20s, get worse in our 30s, and then can start killing us off. In our hearts, it’s a heart attack. In our brains, it’s a stroke. In our extremities, it can mean gangrene. And, in our aorta, an aneurism. If there is anyone in this audience that is older than ten years of age, then the choice isn’t whether or not to eat healthy to prevent heart disease—it’s whether or not you want to reverse the heart disease you already have.

As Drs. Ornish and Esselstyn proved, you can reverse heart disease with a plant-based diet. But, we don’t have to wait for our first heart attack to unclog our arteries. We can start reversing our heart disease right now. We can start reversing heart disease in our kids—tonight.

How do we do it? According to the Editor-in-Chief of the American Journal of Cardiology this year, the only risk factor required for these atherosclerotic plaques—our #1 killer—is cholesterol. Elevated LDL or “bad” cholesterol in our blood. To drop our LDL cholesterol, we need to drop our intake of three things: trans fat, saturated fat, and dietary cholesterol.

Trans fats increase our risk of heart disease, sudden death, and diabetes, and are basically found only one place in nature: animal fat. The food industry, however, found a way to synthetically create these toxic fats by hardening vegetable oil in a process called hydrogenation, which rearranges their atoms to make them behave more like animal fats. Currently, nearly half of America’s trans fat intake comes from animal products.

According to the USDA, cheese, milk, yogurt, burgers, chicken fat, turkey meat, bologna, and hot dogs contain up to about 1 to 5% trans fats naturally. They also found small amounts of trans fats in non-hydrogenated vegetable oils, due to the refining process.

Is getting a few percent trans fats a problem, though? The most prestigious scientific body in the United States, the National Academies of Science, concluded that the only safe intake of trans fat is zero, because any incremental increase in trans fatty acid intake increases coronary heart disease risk. Trans fat intake, irrespective of source—hydrogenated junk food or animal fat—may increase cardiovascular disease risk.

Because trans fats are unavoidable in ordinary non-vegan diets, getting down to zero percent trans fats would require significant changes in patterns of dietary intake for most Americans. One of the authors of the report, the Director of Harvard’s Cardiovascular Epidemiology Program, famously explained why, despite this, they didn’t recommend a plant-based diet: “We can’t tell people to stop eating all meat and all dairy products,” he said. “Well, we could tell people to become vegetarians,” he added. “If we were truly basing this only on science, we would, but it is a bit extreme.”

Wouldn’t want scientists basing anything on science, now. Would we? No.

Avoiding saturated fat means basically avoiding dairy, chicken, cake, and pork. And avoiding cholesterol means avoiding animal products in general—especially eggs. The American Egg Board, a promotional marketing board appointed by the U.S. government, whose mission works “to increase demand for egg and egg products, on behalf of U.S. egg producers.” Because the board is overseen by the federal government, if an egg corporation wants to dip into the $10 million the Egg Board sets aside every year for advertising, they’re not allowed to break the law with those funds—what a concept. This leads to quite revealing exchanges between egg corporations and the USDA, on what the egg industry can and cannot say about eggs.

Thanks to the Freedom of Information Act, I was able to get my hands on some of those emails. Do ya wanna see ’em? Of course, a lot of what I got looked like this… (entire page filled with censored [redacted] text) “Please note a number of items” about our salmonella crisis module—”any questions?” Or, even better, entire sheets of paper that literally just said this. That was the whole sheet of paper. Our tax dollars, hard at work.

But, check this out. This is some egg company trying to put out a brochure on healthy snacking for kids. But, because of existing laws against false and misleading advertising, the head of the USDA’s poultry Research and Promotion Programs reminds them that you can’t couch eggs or egg products as being healthy or nutritious. See, the words nutritious and healthy carry certain connotations (you know that a food is actually good for you), but, because eggs have the amount of cholesterol they do (plus all the saturated fat), the words healthy and nutritious are problematic when it comes to eggs. This is the USDA saying this!

Since you can’t say eggs are a healthy start to the day, the USDA suggests eggs are a “satisfying” start. Can’t call eggs a healthy ingredient, but you can call eggs a “recognizable” ingredient. Can’t truthfully say eggs are good for you. By law, the egg industry needs to steer clear of words like “healthy” or “nutritious.” For a food to be labeled “healthy” under FDA rules, it has to be low in saturated fat—eggs fail that test—and, less than 90mg of cholesterol per serving. Even half an egg fails that.

Not only is the industry barred from saying eggs are healthy, they can’t even refer to eggs as safe: “all references to safety must be removed.” Remember, this is the USDA talking. Why? Because more than 100,000 Americans are salmonella-poisoned, by eggs—every year.

Instead of “safe,” you can call eggs “fresh,” the USDA marketing service suggests. But, you can’t call eggs safe. You cannot say eggs are safe to eat. Can’t say they’re safe; can’t even mention safety. Can’t say they’re healthful. All “references to healthfulness must be deleted,” as well.

Wait a second. Not only can eggs not be called healthy, they can’t even be called safe? Says who? Says the United States Department of Agriculture. I love the Freedom of Information Act.

Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders are next. I always assumed cholesterol drugs were the top class of drugs prescribed. But, it’s actually painkillers, for conditions like fibromyalgia, a syndrome suffered by millions, that can be dramatically improved with a variety of plant-based diets—in fact, producing some of the “most impressive results” to date.

I already covered both diabetes, and, depression, as two of our leading causes of death, last year.

Pap smears—for early detection of cervical cancer—are a common reason for a doctor’s visit. Cervical cancer is now considered a sexually transmitted disease, caused by a sexually transmitted virus, HPV.

Most young women these days contract HPV, but most don’t get cervical cancer, because their immune systems are able to clear the virus away. 70% of women clear the infection within one year, and more than 90% within two years—before the virus can cause cancer, unless you’re immunocompromised or something.

Well, if that’s the case, maybe those with particularly strong immune systems might clear the virus even faster. That’s what may be behind this new study, that found women eating vegetarian also appeared to have significantly lower infection rates with HPV—one of many studies reporting lower risk of HPV infection among those eating plant-based diets.

So, for example, if you take a bunch of women with cancer-causing strains of HPV infecting their cervix, and retest at three months, then nine months—while analyzing their diets, what do you find? Higher levels of vegetable consumption may cut the risk of HPV persistence in half, doubling one’s likelihood of clearing this cancer-causing infection. And, “higher” levels meant just like two or more servings a day.

This may help explain these important new findings this year. Vegan woman have significantly lower rates of all female cancers combined, including cancer of the cervix. So, even though it’s a virus that’s causing the cancer, a healthy diet may still reduce the risk.

In the same way, fermented pickles, kimchi, and sauerkraut foster the growth of good bacteria by maintaining an acidic environment, so does the human vagina. The normal pH of one’s vagina is that of tomato juice.

Once it starts creeping up to that of coffee, though, an overgrowth of bad bacteria can take hold, and cause bacterial vaginosis, which affects an astounding 29% of American women—making it the most frequent cause of vaginal complaints. It’s commonly diagnosed with the so-called whiff test, where the doctor takes a whiff of the vaginal discharge, smelling for the characteristic fishy odor.

Why’s it so common? Well, it’s thought that “High fat intake, particularly saturated fat [remember—dairy, chicken, cake, and pork], may increase vaginal pH, thereby increasing the risk of bacterial vaginosis.” So, now that we know, “The next steps ahead include sharing these findings with OB/GYNS, and general practitioners, as well as increasing the awareness of the general community to the importance of optimal nutrition, to prevent infections of the genital tract, reduce associated disease, and maintain reproductive health.”

What might saturated fat do to the reproductive health of men? A recent Harvard study found that increasing saturated fat intake just 5% was associated with a 38% lower sperm count. But why? I’ve talked about the role of xenoestrogens—endocrine-disrupting industrial pollutants that build up in animal fat. But, male fertility is not just about sperm count (the number of sperm), but also how well the sperm cells work. More about that in my video on Male Fertility and Diet.

When it comes to male reproductive health, though, here is what doctors hear about the most. Erectile dysfunction is present in up to 30 million men in the U.S., and approximately 100 million men worldwide. Wait a second. The U.S. only has around 5% of the world’s population, yet up to 30% of the impotence? We’re #1!

Who cares, though? We’ve got red white and blue pills, like Viagra. The problem is, pills just cover up the symptoms of vascular disease, and don’t do anything for the underlying pathology. Erectile dysfunction and coronary artery disease can be thought of as two manifestations of the same disease—inflamed, clogged, and crippled arteries.

In fact, 40% of men over 40 have erectile dysfunction—40 over 40. Placing them at nearly 50 times the risk of having a cardiac event—like sudden death. Nearly a 5,000% increase in risk, leading the latest review to ask, “Is there any risk greater?”

And, we used to think of erectile dysfunction in younger men, in their 20s and 30s, as “psychogenic in origin”—meaning it’s all in their heads. But, now were realizing it’s more likely the early signs of vascular disease. A man with erectile dysfunction (even if they have no cardiac symptoms) should be considered a cardiac patient, until proved otherwise.

The reason even young men should care about their cholesterol level is that hardening of the arteries can lead to softening of the penis later in life. Your cholesterol level now can predict your sexual functioning later.

Just going to keep eating crap because you can pop some pills? All the Viagra in the world may not help your sex life after a stroke. The take-home message is a simple equation: ED stands for early death. It’s survival of the firmest.

The enzyme that Viagra-like drugs muck with is found primarily in two places in the body: the erectile tissue of the penis, and the retinas of the eyes. That’s why the FDA encourages people to stop taking drugs like Viagra, and call a doctor right away if you experience sudden loss of vision, (if, of course, you can still find your phone).

Which brings up the next group of primary diagnoses—injury and poisoning—which includes adverse drug side effects.

Next comes skin complaints. Any hope for those with cellulite? Check out the video, but basically, researchers compared a meat-free, egg-free diet of mostly vegetables, grains, beans, fruits, and nuts to the conventional diabetic diet. The veg group lost more weight, even though they were made to eat the exact same number of calories—yet still lost more weight. Lost more waist; got slimmer; lost more cholesterol; more subcutaneous fat, and more belly fat. And the subcutaneous fat is what makes up cellulite.

And those with sensitive skin should give flax seeds a try.

Next up is digestive issues. Though, there is an International Prune Association, keeping us all apprised of the latest prune news from around the world. In the U.S., the California prune board successfully pressured the FDA to change the name from prunes to dried plums, which evidently evokes more of a positive, fresh fruit goodness image, in hopes of attracting their target audience—women. (Of course, it might help if they actually included one or two on their board.)

The name change was in hopes of “de-emphasizing” its connections to digestive regularity issues. Why sell yourself short, though!? Randomized clinical trial: prunes vs. Metamucil. Nearly 60 million Americans suffer from chronic constipation. Here’s the study subjects at baseline. Each dot is a complete spontaneous bowel movement. Note how many people had zero bowel movements— per week—at baseline, but how many had an average of 1.7 a week, which went up to 3.5 on prunes—a bowel movement every other day, at least. Better than Metamucil. They conclude that dried plums should be considered as a first-line therapy for chronic constipation.

But, if that’s what adding one plant can do, what if all you ate was plants? Off the charts. Vegans, it turns out, are just regular people.

Elsewhere on my website, I also cover other common digestive conditions, such as irritable bowel and chronic indigestion.

But, what about cancer?

A half-million Americans are expected to die this year from cancer—equal to five jumbo jets crashing every day. The number of Americans who die from cancer each year is more than all those who have died in all U.S. wars combined. And, this happens every single year.

A tumor cannot grow, though, without a blood supply. Currently, it is believed that a tumor can’t get much bigger than the ball at the tip of a pen without a blood supply, which indicates that angiogenesis (angio means vessel; so genesis is the creation of new blood vessels) is critical to tumor growth.

Each one of us has cancer cells in our bodies right now. But, they can’t grow without getting hooked up to a blood supply. So, tumors diabolically release angiogenic factors—chemicals that cause new blood vessels to sprout into the tumor. The most important one is called VEGF—vascular endothelial growth factor. But, we can suppress VEGF with veggies.

Many of the phytonutrients we know and love in tea, and spices, and fruit, and berries, and broccoli, and beans, can block cancer’s stimulation of new blood vessels. Given the power of plants, one might speculate that the foundation of an anti-angiogenic approach to cancer might be a whole food vegan diet.

How else can we starve cancer? Forty years ago, a landmark paper was published showing that many human cancers have what’s called absolute methionine dependency—meaning “normal cells thrive without the amino acid methionine, but cancer cells need it (and must get it), or they die.”

What does cancer do with the methionine? Tumors use methionine to generate gaseous sulphur-containing compounds that specially trained diagnostic dogs actually can detect. There are mole-sniffing dogs that can pick out skin cancer. There are breath-sniffing dogs that can pick out people with lung cancer. Pee-sniffing dogs that can diagnose bladder cancer. And, yes, you guessed it—fart-sniffing dogs for colorectal cancer. Doctors can now bring their Lab to the lab. A whole new meaning to the term PET scan.

Chemo companies are fighting to be the first to come out with a methionine-depleting drug. But, since methionine is sourced mainly from food, a better strategy may be to lower methionine levels by lowering methionine intake—eliminating high-methionine foods for both cancer growth control as well as lifespan extension.

So, where is methionine found? Particularly in chicken, and fish, milk, red meat, and eggs (which have less). But, if you really want to stick with lower methionine foods, stick with plants—fruits, nuts, veggies, grains, and beans. In other words, “In humans, methionine restriction may be achieved using a predominately vegan diet,” making methionine restriction “feasible, as a life extension strategy.”

So, do people who choose beans live longer? Legumes– beans, split peas, chickpeas, and lentils— may be the single most important dietary predictor of survival in older people from around the globe, whereas a bean-free diet may increase the risk of death.

It is now eight years since the famous Ornish study was published, suggesting that 12 months on a strictly plant-based diet could reverse the progression of prostate cancer.

Wait a second. How were they able to get a group of older men to go vegan for a year? They home-delivered prepared meals to their door, figuring men are so lazy, they’ll just eat whatever’s put in front of them.

But, what about out in the real world? Realizing that you can’t get most men with cancer to eat even a measly five servings of fruits and veggies, researchers settled on just trying to change their A-to-V ratio—the ratio of animal to vegetable proteins. And, indeed, were successful in cutting this ratio in half at least—from about two to one animal to plant, to kinda half-vegan, one to one.

How’d they do? A part-time plant-based diet appeared to slow down cancer progression. What Ornish got, though, was an apparent reversal in cancer growth. The cancer biomarker PSA didn’t just rise slower; thanks to eating healthier, it trended down—which could be an indication of tumor shrinkage. So, the ideal animal-to-plant ratio may be closer to zero.

But if there’s just no way grandpa’s going vegan, and we just have half-measures, what might be the worst A, and the best V? Eggs and poultry may be the worst, respectively doubling, and potentially quadrupling, the risk of cancer progression. Harvard researchers found eating less than a single egg a day doubles the risk—and, eating less than a single serving of chicken or turkey quadruples the risk.

And, if you could only add one thing to your diet? Cruciferous vegetables. Less than a single serving a day of either broccoli or Brussels sprouts, cabbage, cauliflower, or kale may cut the risk of cancer progression more than half. A similar result was found for breast cancer survivors—less than a single serving a day may cut the risk in half of the cancer coming back.

This Women’s Healthy Eating and Living Study was undertaken in 3,000 breast cancer survivors to determine whether a plant-based, low-fat, high-fiber diet could influence breast cancer recurrence rates and survival.

Imagine you have been diagnosed with breast cancer. In fact, an estrogen receptor negative tumor, which normally means twice the death rate—unless you eat five servings of fruits and veggies a day, and walk 30 minutes, six days a week. The “high” vegetable, fruit, and physical activity should really be in quotes. I mean, you could eat five servings in a single meal, and certainly walk more than, like, two miles a day.

But, imagine, for a second, you have just been diagnosed. Imagine sitting in that chair, in the doctor’s office, as your doctor breaks the news. Imagine how you’d feel, at that moment. Let it sink in. But, your doctor says there’s also a new experimental treatment that can cut your chances of dying in the next few years from over 16%, down to just 4%. To quadruple their survival rate, many women would remortgage their homes to fly to some quack clinic in Mexico; would lose all their hair to chemo. But most, apparently, couldn’t stand the thought of eating broccoli, and cutting down on meat.

Maybe someone should start cooking meals for the women, too!

The only reason Ornish and colleagues could get away with treating prostate cancer with a vegan diet alone—with no chemo, surgery or radiation—is because prostate’s such a slow-growing cancer, that patients with early disease can be placed in a holding pattern. So, if you’re not going to do anything but watch-and-wait, might as well test out a dietary intervention. Are there other cancers like that we can try plants on?

Esophageal cancer, for example, which is not the cancer to get. Most die within months of diagnosis. But, the development of esophageal cancer is a multistage process. You start out with a normal esophagus—the tube that connects your mouth to your stomach. Starts out fine, then precancerous changes start to take place. Then, localized cancer starts to grow. Then, eventually it spreads, and you die.

Because of the well-defined, stepwise progression of the cancer, researchers jumped on it as a way to test the ability of berries—the healthiest of fruits—to reverse this process. A randomized Phase Two clinical trial of powdered strawberries. Six months eating the equivalent of a pound of fresh strawberries a day, and the progression of disease was reversed in 80% of the patients.

At the beginning of the study, none had a normal esophagus. But, by the end of the study, most lesions either regressed from moderate to mild, or disappeared completely. From moderate to mild. Or, from mild to gone. By the end of the study, half of those on the high-dose strawberry treatment walked away disease-free. 52.7% cured.

A drop in tumor markers: before and after. All because of just strawberries. Cellular proliferation before, and none after, strawberry treatment. Same story with black raspberries and oral cancer; most of the patients’ lesions improved, including complete clinical regression. Now, you see it; now, you don’t. A turning back on, of tumor-suppressor genes. So, even though it may have been something like tobacco that caused the cancer, diet may still affect progression. But, this kind of treasure remains “berried”—no pun intended—because nobody profits. Nobody, that is, except the hundreds of thousands of people that otherwise would die every year from these horrific cancers.

And, finally, infections. After the common cold, the most common infection is of the urinary tract. We’ve known for decades that it’s bacteria creeping up from the rectum that cause bladder infections. But, only recently did we figure out where that rectal reservoir of bladder-infecting E.coli was coming from: chicken.

We now have “proof of a direct link” between farm animals, meat, and bladder infections—solid evidence that urinary tract infections can be a zoonosis, that is, bladder infections as an animal-to-human disease. The best way to prevent bladder infections is the same way you best prevent any type of infections—by not getting infected in the first place.

Can’t you just use a meat thermometer, and cook the chicken thoroughly? No, because of cross-contamination. We’ve known for decades that if you give someone a frozen chicken to prepare and cook in their own kitchen as they normally would, a multitude of antibiotic-resistant E. coli jump from the chicken into the gut of the volunteer—even before eating it! This jump happens after the bird is prepared, but before any meat was eaten.

So, not only did it not matter how well the chicken was cooked; it doesn’t even matter if you eat any! It’s bringing it into the home, and handling it. Within days, the drug-resistant chicken bacteria had multiplied to the point of becoming a major part of the person’s gut flora. The chicken bacteria was taking over.

What if you’re really careful in the kitchen, though? “The effectiveness of hygiene procedures for prevention of cross-contamination from chicken carcasses in the domestic kitchen.” They went into five dozen homes, gave them each a chicken, and asked them to cook it. After they were done cooking, there was bacteria from chicken feces—salmonella, campylobacter, both serious human pathogens—everywhere. On the cutting board, utensils, on their hands, on the fridge handle, cupboard, oven handle doorknob. But this was before they cleaned up.

What about after cleaning? Still, pathogenic fecal bacterial everywhere. And, this was just regular retail chicken bought at the store. The researchers didn’t, like, inoculate the birds with bacteria— they came prepackaged with pathogens. Obviously, people don’t know what they’re doing in the kitchen. So, they took another group of people, and gave them specific instructions. After you cook the chicken you have to wash everything with hot water and detergent. They were told, specifically: wash the cutting board, knobs on the sink, the faucet, the fridge, the doorknobs, everything. Okay, and, the researchers still found disease-causing fecal matter chicken bugs everywhere.

Fine. Last group. This time, they were going to insist that people bleach everything. The dishcloth, immersed in bleach disinfectant, and then they spray the bleach on all those surfaces. Let the bleach disinfectant sit there for five minutes. And, still they found campylobacter and salmonella on some utensils, a dishcloth, the counter around the sink, and the cupboard. Definitely better, but still. Unless our kitchen is like some biohazard lab, the only way to guarantee we’re not going to leave infection around the kitchen is to not bring it into the house in the first place.

The good news is that it’s not like you eat chicken once, and you’re colonized for life. In this study, the chicken bacteria only seemed to last about ten days before our good bacteria was able to muscle it out of the way. The problem is that most families eat chicken more than once every ten days, so they may be constantly reintroducing these chicken bugs into their systems.

What if you already have a urinary tract infection though? For example, can cranberry juice treat bladder infections?

Find out in my video, “Can Cranberry Juice Treat Bladder Infections?” Of course, eating chicken can give you regular food poisoning, too. When foodborne pathogens were ranked last year to figure out which was kind of the worst, #1 on their list was salmonella, the leading cause of food poisoning related hospitalization, and the #1 cause of food-infection related death. Yet it remains legal to sell salmonella-contaminated chicken in the supermarket. It all goes back to a famous case in 1974, when the American Public Health Association sued the USDA, saying wait a second;

you can’t put a stamp of approval on meat contaminated with our leading foodborne killer. What could the USDA possibly say in meat’s defense? They pointed out that, look, there’s salmonella infections linked to dairy and eggs, too, so since there are numerous sources of contamination it would be unjustified to single out the meat industry.

That’s like the tuna industry saying, yeah, there’s no reason to put, you know, label levels of mercury on tuna cans because people can get exposed to eating a thermometer, too! OK… The DC Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the meat industry position, arguing you can allow potentially deadly salmonella in meat because, and I quote, “American housewives normally are not ignorant or stupid, and their methods of preparing and cooking food does not ordinarily result in salmonella poisoning.” That’s like saying, “Oh, minivans don’t need seatbelts because, you know, soccer moms don’t ordinarily crash into things.” To this day it’s legal to sell salmonella contaminated meat.

Anyways, there we have it—the top dozen reasons people seek medical care. Mostly, for diseases that could have been prevented. And then, rather than treating the underlying causes of the disease, typically doctors treat risk factors for disease—such as giving a lifetime’s worth of medications to lower high blood pressure, blood sugar, and cholesterol.

But, think about it. High blood pressure is just a symptom of diseased, dysfunctional arteries. Yes, you can artificially lower blood pressure with drugs, but that’s not treating the root cause. Disregarding the underlying causes, and treating only risk factors is somewhat like mopping up the floor around an overflowing sink, instead of just turning off the faucet. But, drug companies are more than happy to sell people a new roll of paper towels, every day, for the rest of their lives.

When the underlying lifestyle causes are addressed, patients often are able to stop taking medication, or avoid surgery. We spend billions cracking people’s chests open, but only rarely does it actually prolong anyone’s life.

In contrast, how about wiping out at least 90% of heart disease? Think about it. Heart disease accounts for more premature deaths than any other illness, and is almost completely preventable by simply changing diet and lifestyle. And, those same changes can prevent, or reverse, many other chronic diseases as well—the same dietary changes! So, why don’t more doctors do it?

Well, one reason is doctors don’t get paid for it. No one profits from lifestyle medicine, so it is not part of medical education or practice. Presently, physicians lack training and financial incentives. So, they continue to do what they know how to do—prescribe medication, and perform surgery.

After Dean Ornish proved you could reverse our #1 cause of death—heart disease; open up arteries without drugs, without surgery—just with a plant-based diet and other healthy changes, he thought that his studies would have a meaningful effect on the practice of mainstream cardiology. After all, a cure for our #1 killler? But, he admits, he was mistaken. He realized physician “reimbursement is a much more powerful determinant of medical practice than research.”

Reimbursement over research. Not a very flattering portrayal of the healing profession. But hey, if docs won’t do it without getting paid, let’s get them paid. So, Dr. Ornish went to Washington arguing that, look, “If we train and pay for doctors to learn how to help patients address the real causes of disease with lifestyle medicine and not just treat disease risk-factors, we could save trillions,”—and, that’s just talking heart disease, diabetes, prostate, and breast cancer.

The “Take Back Your Health Act” was introduced in the U.S. Senate in 2009 to induce doctors to learn and practice lifestyle medicine—not only because it works better, but (and here’s the critical factor) physicians will be paid to do it. The bill died—just like millions of Americans will continue to do, with reversible chronic diseases.

We have known for at least a decade that the leading causes of both premature death and persistent misery in our society are chronic diseases. These diseases are attributable to the use of our feet (exercise), forks (diet), and fingers (smoking). Feet, forks, and fingers are the master levers of medical destiny, for not just thousands of people on any one occasion—like a tsunami or earthquake—but the medical destiny of millions upon millions, year after year.

We, as doctors, as a medical profession, have known all this. Ornish published 23 years ago. But, “we have not managed to care,” writes the Director of Yale University’s Prevention Research Center. “At least, not care deeply enough to turn what we know into what we routinely do. Were we to do so, we might be able to eliminate” most heart disease, strokes, diabetes, and cancer.

But saving millions of lives is just a number. He asks doctors to forget the bland statistics of public health, and ask yourself if you love someone who has suffered a heart attack, stroke, cancer, or diabetes. “Now, imagine their faces, whisper their names. Recall what it felt like to get the news. And, while [you’re] at it, imagine the faces of others…like you and me imagining beloved faces.” Look around the room.

“Now imagine if eight of 10 of us wistfully reflecting on intimate love and loss, on personal anguish, never got that dreadful news because it never happened. Mom did not get cancer; dad did not have a heart attack; grandpa did not have a stroke; sister, brother, aunt, and uncle did not lose a limb or kidney or eyes to diabetes. We are all intimately linked, in a network of personal tragedy, that need never have occurred.”

Which leads to what he is asking doctors to do about it—to “put a face on public health every chance you get. When talking about heart disease and its prevention—or cancer or diabetes—ask your audience to see in their mind’s eye the face of a loved one affected by that condition. Then, imagine that loved one…among the 80% who need never have succumbed if what we knew [as doctors] were what we do.”

96,2,"On Friday a black man named DeWayne Craddock, an engineer employed by the city of Virginia Beach, shot 16 people in the local government building, killing 12, 9 of whom were white. He had reportedly earlier submitted his resignation. This is yet another example of the phenomenon that VDARE.com calls âDisgruntled Minority Massacre.â Itâs not caused by racism, but by anti-racismâwith more than a little help from the complicit Main Stream Media, which probably explains its increasingly frenzied drive to suppress facts like Craddockâs race.

City officials are claiming they didnât fire Craddock and have no idea why he did this. A New York Times report says different, that heâd started acting violent, and was on the verge of losing his job:

It remains to be seen what the suspect was after. City officials declined to discuss a possible motive for the attack, but they did say there was no immediate indication that the gunman had targeted anyone. The police chief, James A. Cervera, quelled rumors on Saturday that the suspect had recently been fired, and declined to say whether there had been friction between him and other employees. But a person close to Virginia Beachâs city government, who was not authorized to speak publicly, said that the suspect had no history of behavioral problems until recently, when he had begun acting strangely and getting into physical âscufflesâ with other city workers. The person said that tensions had escalated in the past week, adding that the man had gotten into a violent altercation on city grounds and was told that disciplinary action would be taken. Suspect in Virginia Beach Shooting Was a Longtime City Employee, by Serge F. Kovaleski, June 1, 2019

This story, like all other New York Times stories, does not mention Craddockâs race.

A second story, describes Craddock as “an engineer” and “a 40-year-old former soldier,” goes on to say “Much about Mr. Craddock, an engineer who had worked on projects like sewer pipelines and pump station replacements, remained unclear.” [Virginia Beach Gunman Said He Was Quitting, Then Went on a Shooting Rampage, By Glenn Thrush and Alan Blinder, June 2, 2019 html]

You’re telling me! The Paper Of Record doesn’t even know what color he was, and apparently canât find a photograph.

The NYTâs motto: âAll The News Thatâs Fit To Print.â

This news blackout on Craddockâs race is unusually severe even by recent standards. Maybe thereâs been some Journolist-style secret decree. A similarly photographless story in the Washington Post describes him this way:

Again, no word of Craddockâs race, although WaPo went to a black church and interviewed friends of his parents. They werenât described as black either.

The Washington Postâs new post-Trump motto: âDemocracy Dies In Darknessâ.

But the U.K. Daily Mail, which specializes in crime news the American papers wonât print, managed to find no less than three photographs of him.

[PICTURED: ‘Loner’ Virginia Beach gunman, 40, and longtime city engineer who ‘brushed his teeth and chatted to a colleague’ before ‘indiscriminately’ shooting dead 12 and dying in a police gun battle, by Lauren Fruen and Rod Ardehali,Dailymail.com, June 1, 2019]

Still, if you get your information from the U.S. Main Stream Media, youâre out of luck.

A VDARE.com reader watched ABC News with David Muir and reports that it showed no photo of Craddock at all, just a silhouette. A white silhouette.

And ABC may be right about thatâmany Americans still get all their news from legacy MSM sources.

Which means that many, many, people whoâve heard about this case almost certainly believe that a white man did it.

Like this lady–she probably hated white males already, but here she’s the victim of MSM suppression. She assumes that if the longtime city employee wasn’t white, they would have said so:

This policy of ânot reporting raceâ leads to a false consciousness on the subject of crime, as Iâve written repeatedly before. The DeWayne Craddock case is a confluence of the ânot reporting raceâ custom and the phenomenon of âDisgruntled Minority Massacres.â

âNot reporting raceâ of a criminal unless itâs ârelevantâ is embodied in the AP Stylebook used by most MSM sources. It goes back to the New York Timesâs reporting on the âBlood Brothersâ gang in Harlem in 1964. As I wrote in 2007, this led to five days of rioting in Harlem, because the black community felt theyâd been maligned by being called violent.

The plain fact is that, since the Civil Rights movement started, blacks in America have been encouraged to believe that racism is responsible for any bad thing that happens to them, or any disciplinary or law enforcement action taken against them. They are taught to hate whitesânot just by their parents and clergymen, but by American schools. (Hereâs a recent example from Powerlineâs eminently respectable John Hinderaker). They feel, and express, hatred of white society without fear of criticism.

White men who lose jobs frequently kill themselves. Black men who lose jobs frequently kill their co-workers or employers. When black gunman Omar Thornton was fired from a Connecticut brewer for stealing beer, he killed eight of his white coworkers. Before he killed himself, he phoned his mother to say that his victims were racist: âI killed the five racists that was there bothering meâ, he said [Omar Thornton: “I Killed the Five Racists”, by Kevin Hayes, August 4, 2010].

Subsequent investigation âexoneratedâ his victims, but the point is that MSM continued to treat this irrelevant accusation very seriously [Is racism at heart of Connecticut shooting? Answer still unclear, by Patrik Jonsson, Christian Science Monitor, August 4, 2010].

To repeat: what the Christian Science Monitorâs Patrik Jonsson and several other MSM outlets were asking was if the dead white people had been guilty of racismânot the man who murdered them.

To look at it another way: recently, the House Democrats held rigged hearings into âWhite Nationalismâ clearly designed to build the case for repression. Did it occur to anyone in the MSM to ask whether its reports of this irresponsible demagoguery subsequently provoked a clearly disturbed black man to throw a white child off a balcony in a Minnesota mall?

In this kind of atmosphere, black killers are being âradicalizedâ not by obscure webpages, or overseas Muslim radicalsâbut by the MSM and the Democratic Party.

And when a Disgruntled Minority Massacre happens, thereâs an outpouring of rageânot at the killers, but at anyone who mentions it. See Jonathan Chaitâs tweet when a black man shot three white people (two fatally) on camera for reasons the gunman said himself were based on racial hate.

âReal influenceâ? If you want to see someone who exploited peopleâs worse impulses, and had âreal influence,â I give you the former President of the United States.

Remember that Barack Obama, of all privileged people, paranoically said that when he had a regular job as a research assistant in an office in New York he felt âlike a spy behind enemy lines.â

Speaking of the 2014 Ferguson riots, Obama said they were provoked by âreal issues.â It turned out they were provoked by irresponsible reporting. But Obama has never apologized.

And this âreal influenceâ is dangerous to whites everywhereâsee Jared Taylor’s You Swine Happy Now? Black Kills White to Right Historical Wrongs below for the story of Nkosi Thandiwe’s murder of Brittney Watts.

Nevertheless, among Americans who do know that DeWayne Craddock is black, Iâm now seeing unprecedented levels of angerânot at Craddock, or at blacks, but at the MSM.

It may lead to Brett Kavanaugh levels of awakeningâunless it can be stuffed down the Memory Hole.

97,2,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Amazon’s patent application for an always-on feature for Alexa, its popular voice-activated personal assistant, has raised a lot of concern. “If you’re already freaked out by the privacy implications of smart speakers like Amazon’s Echo,” says Gizmodo, “we have some bad news.” A headline in ScienceAlert is even more direct: “Newly Released Amazon Patent Shows Just How Much Creepier Alexa Can Get.” You get the idea.

But the anxiety is much ado about nothing. An Alexa that’s always listening will likely prove more useful than an Alexa that isn’t; and, in any case, always-on devices are certainly our future.

As of January 2019, Amazon had sold more than 100 million devices that include Alexa. That number is certainly dwarfed by the billions of devices that include Siri and Google Assistant. But the difference is, those features come bundled with your smartphone, which has many other uses. When you purchase an Alexa device, you are choosing to invite Amazon into your home to listen to you.

Even those who have no interest in obtaining an Alexa-linked device know how the thing works, if only from Amazon’s flood of television commercials. You say “Alexa, what’s today’s weather?” — and it tells you. Whenever Alexa hears its “wake word,” the software assumes that the user wants its attention. Thus Alexa “wakes,” listens and processes the words that follow as a command.

The difficulty arises because, in the words of the patent application, a wake word “may not always precede a spoken command, and may sometimes be included in the middle of a spoken command.” The application gives an example: “Play ‘Mother’s Little Helper’ by the Rolling Stones.” As currently configured, the system will respond if the user prefaces the request with “Alexa” (that is, “Alexa, play ‘Mother’s Little Helper’”) but not if the wake word comes at the end (that is, “Play ‘Mother’s Little Helper,’ Alexa”).

Put otherwise, Alexa as currently configured does not match the way people speak. The user must structure each command around a relatively formal grammar. The invention described in the patent application would deformalize the means for addressing the device, thus enabling Alexa to fit more easily and naturally into everyday life.

Here’s Amazon’s solution: Alexa already stores what it hears in a buffer. Under the new configuration, according to the application, once Alexa detects a wake word, “the device will go backwards through the audio in the buffer to determine the start of the utterance that includes the wakeword.” After finding what it scores as the most likely start of the command, Alexa will perform a similar calculation to find the end. The command will then be processed exactly like one that was preceded by the wake word.

It all makes a great deal of sense. Why then the concern? It seems to me that there are two potential issues.

One is a worry about what happens to the information from the audio buffer. Alexa currently retains recordings for a period of time, helping it model the user’s needs and wants. This feature, which can be partially disabled, has already caused privacy problems. Courts have issued subpoenas for Alexa recordings. And as Bloomberg News has reported, human beings at Amazon already listen to much of what Alexa hears, in an effort to improve the algorithm. But no always-on feature was necessary for those recordings to survive.

The second concern might be that an Alexa which listens more closely, responding to natural language commands, will soon become an Alexa that fades into the background. The relative formality with which the device must be addressed serves as a reminder that we are addressing just that — a device. The more casually we can speak, the more casual we will likely be about using it. We might, quite literally, forget that Alexa is there. Only the consumer can decide whether that is a feature or a bug.

Amazon says that it has no current plan to change the way Alexa listens, but bear in mind that the always-on feature can be implemented whether or not it is ever patented. In other words, if the notion of a device that is always awake worries you, the fact that a patent application has been filed shouldn’t cause you to worry more. Any device that listens to you can already be made always-on. (Including, by the way, your smartphone.)

We accept that our laptops and smart televisions are recording the choices we make and sending them we know not where. The only reason we imagine that our spoken words are safe is that speech is an older, more instinctive technology. We still think of speech as special, a distinctively human function, and when we are in spaces we consider private, we consider our voice as something heard only by our most intimate and trusted acquaintances.

But to the computers that now surround us, speech is just another form of data. The various voice-commanded devices of today, whether in our homes, smartphones or cars, work just like keyboards or touchscreens. The only difference is that the human input is a voice. And the only way they can get that input is to listen for it.

So let’s calm down. Yes, it can be fun to imagine a future in which our homes are entirely connected and yet we’re able to keep private everything we want to keep private. But that ship sailed long before Amazon decided to seek a patent on a minor and welcome change to Alexa.

98,2,"En medicin-fri tilgang kunne være den bedste behandling som vi har for Amerikas mest udbredte livsstilssygdom.Type II sukkersyge (diabetes) er en af Amerikas mest udbredte og dyre kroniske sygdomme. Patienter har ofte behov for en stribe af medicinalprodukter til at styre højt niveau af blodsukker, og de komplikationer som opstår i det lange løb, lige fra tab af synet og lemmer til nyresvigt og hjertekarsygdomme, hvilket skaber et pres på patienternes resourcer , deres familier og sundhedsvæsenet.Den økonomiske belastning på forsikringsselskaber, arbejdsgivere, og sundhedsvæsenet er endnu større. En undersøgelse i 2013 i the American Journal of Preventive Medicine sætter de direkte medicinalomkostninger over en livstid for behandling af type II sukkersyge til $124,000 for patienter som er diagnosticeret i moden alder. Med tæt ved 30 millioner amerikanere som er berørt af sukkersyge, så vurderer American Diabetes Association den national udgift for direkte sukkersyge behandling til at være omkring $176 milliarder per år.But unlike type I diabetes, which is an autoimmune disorder that destroys insulin-producing cells in the pancreas, type II diabetes is a lifestyle disease, and thus reversible. Over time, people with type-II diabetes can be made more receptive to their own insulin, which in turn allows their bodies to effectively clear glucose from the blood without insulin medication. The trick for the vast majority of type II patients is as simple as losing weight. (""The relationship between obesity and diabetes is of such interdependence that the term 'diabesity' has been coined,"" two diabetes researchers wrote in 2005.)But that ""trick"" is actually pretty hard. Permanent weight loss without bariatric surgery is practically impossible at the population level. A 2014 study by Kaiser Permanente that looked at incidents of non-surgical diabetes remission in 122,781 patients found that it basically doesn't happen. The most commonly cited number among obesity researchers, meanwhile, is five percent-only five percent of people who lose weight without surgery will succeed in keeping it off over the long term.Now Virta Health, a Silicon Valley startup, has developed a lifestyle modification system that can reverse the markers of type II diabetes. In a study published this month , Virta researchers found that over the course of a year, they were able to achieve remission of symptoms and a cessation of several pharmaceutical products in nearly two hundred patients using a ""novel metabolic and continuous remote care model.""Virta uses a combination of the ketogenic diet-which involves moderate fat and protein intake combined with very low carbohydrate intake-and frequent remote contact with a physician and a health coach to help patients change their lifestyle and lower their body weight, their blood glucose, and their HbA1c (a biomarker for diabetes). In its February study, 94 percent of patients in the intervention arm of the trial were able either to cease using insulin or to radically lower their insulin dose, and all of the patients in the intervention arm were able to stop using a class of antidiabetic drugs called sulfonylureas, which increase the amount of insulin released by the pancreas. The control group meanwhile, increased its insulin use over the course of that same year.At $370 a month, Virta's model isn't cheap, but it's cheaper over the course of a year than the suite of drug therapies many type II patients require. And if Virta's model is scalable, the long-term savings on dialysis, hospital stays, and management of diabetic foot ulcers could be massive. Already, the company has partnered with Purdue University and Nielsen to offer the Virta system as a covered health benefit to employees with type II diabetes. The company's stated goal is to reverse diabetes in 100 million people by 2025.I recently spoke to James McCarter, Virta's head of research, about the company's treatment model and the broader landscape of type II diabetes care. McCarter received his A.B. in biology from Princeton, and he got his M.D. and a PhD in genetics from Washington University in St. Louis, where he's an adjunct professor at the medical school. Our conversation has been edited for length and clarity.James McCarter: I think endocrinologists and primary care doctors have reason to be jaded, in that they've seen lifestyle modification fail so many times. The conventional advice of ""eat less and exercise more"" has been shown to not work. People can do caloric restriction for a while, but you know what happens when you calorically restrict without any overall strategy other than just eating less? You get hungry. Exercise, and you get hungry. You can battle that hunger and craving for a while, but eventually it's going to come back. What's generally seen with most lifestyle interventions is that people will lose five pounds and gain it back over the course of a year.Exercise is great for overall fitness and something that I believe in strongly in terms of maintenance of overall health. But it's not a good strategy for weight loss.McCarter: I think that's right, and I think to your point about physicians being jaded, they've seen that lifestyle modification only works in a minority of people. They're not surprised when a patient comes back three months, six months, or a year later and the disease has progressed.McCarter: If you look at a large study that was done by Kaiser a number of years ago, they saw that their remission rate of type II diabetes was well under 1 percent.So what's causing that 50-times improvement in our results? It really comes down to two things. Let's talk first about the physiology and then we'll talk about the behavior change.First of all, using nutritional ketosis as an underlying part of the physiology approach has a tremendous impact on people's ability to succeed in getting glycemic control, which is reduction in medications, improvement in metabolic health, and reduction in weight.The reason for that is that unlike a willpower approach, where you're just trying to force yourself to eat less, using nutritional ketosis allows you to tap into body fat for fuel. That means you have incoming energy from your body fat storage and from dietary fat. As a result, people will naturally tend to eat fewer calories because they are satiated.We ask people everyday, ""Tell us on a four-point scale how you feel about your hunger, cravings, mood, and energy. What we see is that as people achieve nutritional ketosis, energy and mood go up, hunger and cravings go down.In effect, the physiology of ketosis is providing you with a tail wind. It's making the whole process much easier.McCarter: The other part of our model is the coaching. The number of people who can just read a diet book and implement its recommendations without any monitoring or coaching is small. What we're doing with Virta is we're providing five things: We're providing a physician with telemedicine for medication management; a health coach with an ongoing, one-on-one daily relationship who consults on nutrition and behavior change; education that's provided online; biometric feedback; and an online community.Essentially, we're providing a whole support environment that allows people to understand what they're doing and why.McCarter: Rather than measuring calories, what we're doing is having people monitor their approximate macronutrients. Roughly how many carbohydrates am I having on a daily basis? How much protein am I having on a daily basis? It's a low-carbohydrate, moderate-protein diet.What we have people do instead of an elaborate food diary is measure daily blood beta hydroxybutyrate. That's one of the ketone bodies, and by seeing an elevation in beta hydroxybutyrate, we're able to say, ""Oh, you're actually in nutritional ketosis which means you're burning fat for fuel which is what we want to achieve.""It doesn't mean you have a caloric deficit necessarily, but at least you're getting your diet and other aspects of your lifestyle correct in a way that supports nutritional ketosis. And we're looking at glucose as well. That way we can say on a daily basis, are you on track or off track?Now, calories still do matter. What generally happens, even though we are not asking people to count calories, is that because they are feeling satiety in their meals at an earlier point, they're creating a deficit. Rather than having a second or third helping, they're saying after one helping, ""Gosh, I feel you know, adequately full."" They are generally eating less, especially in the first six months.McCarter: Right, and it's going to be a different journey for everyone. Some people just get it right out of the gate. Other people will take quite a few weeks or even months before they really figure out exactly how to do this. One of the key things we've found is a need for individualization. We want this to work not just for the quantified self-optimizer, but for somebody who has had diabetes for 10 or 20 years, who is on insulin or other potent diabetes drugs they want to stop taking. It has to work for somebody who is a stay-at-home parent, for a business traveler, for somebody working the night shift. It has to work for different ethnic cuisines; it has to work for different dietary restrictions.That's what both our software and our health coaches aim to do. Make changes that work for specific individuals.McCarter: Conventional wisdom has shifted somewhat. Many physicians would describe it as effective for weight loss, but most would say that it is a short-term measure that is not sustainable. Many do worry about dietary fat. There is a growing movement that counters the status-quo. While the number of physicians that recommend a sustained low carb approach for weight loss and metabolic health is still limited, it is growing rapidly. For instance, the international petition [Dr. Sarah Hallberg of Virta and Indiana University Health] started for Dr. Tim Noakes last week has garnered nearly 35,000 signatures, including many physicians and medical professionals. [Editor: Tim Noakes is a South African physician who pioneered early research into the low-carb, high-fat diet as a treatment for type II diabetes. The Health Professions Council of South Africa is attempting to revoke Noakes' medical license because he told a woman on Twitter that she could feed her baby such a diet when the child finished breastfeeding.]We find that when we start taking care of a patient, their primary care doctor, who often begins as a skeptic, quickly converts to a supporter based on the results we obtain and the supporting scientific literature we provide.Jim: You're exactly right. It doesn't work without technology and it doesn't work without the ability to provide what we call continuous remote care. We actually tested that in our clinical trial. Of the 262 people with type II diabetes that were in the intervention arm, half received everything remotely - the physician, the health coach, the education, all of it.The other half received all the remote stuff but also came to an in-person classroom setting with 10 to 20 other people and a health coach at our clinic. Initially, it was once a week, and then less frequently over time. The outcomes between the in-person group and the remote-only group were statistically indistinguishable.Jim: That's part of the reason we structured Virta the way we did, with an actual one-on-one relationship with a coach. There are prior clinical studies that have shown that when you have this coaching relationship, as opposed to entirely automated or entirely self-directed program, people will do better.Jim: Let me talk you through the medications a little bit and address Metformin as part of that. The first thing I should say is that medication reduction is symptomatic of an overall improvement in metabolic health.Of all the medications for type II diabetes, there are things that can be done right away and there are things that take more time. First off, we want to avoid hypoglycemic events, which is low blood sugar. If you're on potent hypoglycemic medications, which are medications like sulfonylureas and insulin that lower your blood sugar, and then you go on a carbohydrate-restricted diet, that's going to drive you toward low blood sugar levels. So what we try to do early on is very aggressively remove sulfonylurea. Fully everyone in our trial were off that within the first three months.After that, we're aggressively titrating the insulin downwards, so that about half of the insulin was gone by three months and another nearly half of patients had it reduced. Ninety-four percent of people in the intervention group were able to either reduce or eliminate their insulin use.But the one that we generally will leave alone and not aggressively reduce is metformin. The reasons for that are that it is generally well-tolerated, it's generally inexpensive, and there's a growing body of evidence that it's effective in prediabetes. The American Diabetes Association now recommends metformin for people with prediabetes to prevent progression to diabetes, and there is also emerging evidence that it may have some other benefits, including longevity benefits.That's the rationale to leave metformin in place if it's well-tolerated. Our definition for having reversed diabetes is that patients have glycemic control, which means they've lowered their hemoglobin A1C lower than 6.5, which is the diabetes threshold, without diabetes medications other than metformin.McCarter: There's plenty of work to be done, so I'm not worried about what's going to happen to many of the incumbent players. For instance, there are not enough endocrinologists to take care of all the people with type II diabetes in the United States. If Virta is successful over time, maybe this allows endocrinologists, who are incredibly well-trained, to concentrate on more challenging diseases, like type I diabetes and other extremely challenging endocrine disorders.As for the pharmaceutical industry, there's plenty of disease out there to be handled. There are also people for whom the types of behavior change we're advocating are not a fit for them. It's not as if we're going to get 100 percent adoption. The industry is going to be disrupted over time, but it will adjust.McCarter: To get a sense of how industries adapt, it helps to look back at the late 1970s, which is when the dietary recommendations for low-fat foods came out. You can see that within about five years, the food industry rolled out thousands of products where they just removed fat and put in sugar and starch. That probably didn't do consumers any favors, but it showed the speed with which industry can respond.McCarter: Yeah, people are focusing on protein. In the coming five years, I think you're going to see a return to the idea that fats can be beneficial. As opposed to saying something is low-fat, I think you're going to see things that advertise as being high-fat.McCarter: There was actually a report from Credit Suisse a couple of years ago, maybe two years ago now, where they basically predicted all of this. It was kind of an industry direction report suggesting that fat was a marketing tool.McCarter: On the commercial side of things, our goal is to make this available and affordable to everyone over time. To begin to break through, we've been concentrating on employers. Self-insured employers are on the hook for the costs. What we can do is we can go to that employer and say, ""Hey, work with us to have your folks with type II diabetes join the Virta Clinic and turn that around."" We put a fair amount of the fee structure at risk. It's outcomes-based, so if we don't succeed in reversing type II diabetes, we don't get paid.McCarter: Absolutely. The Virta-IUH trial ( see clinicaltrials.gov listing ) was originally designed for two years and has recently been extended to five years. You can read the description on our blog . We will be publishing two-year and five-year outcomes. We are also following our commercial patients long-term, with more to come on that in a few months. The longterm view is super important."

The comedy scene in Brooklyn has spawned a bevy of unique and out-there funny folks, but with clubs closed up for the time being, seeing funny people live is not very doable. Luckily, the Eastville Comedy Club (487 Atlantic Ave.; 347-889-5226) is live streaming comedians from their homes and hosting virtual open mics (all via Zoom) on a nearly nightly basis. Tickets are available at donation rates ranging from $1-$40 (slated to benefit Brooklyn COVID-19 charities and the club, as well as its employees); visit eastvillecomedy.com for schedule and ticket purchase."
103,3,"During the 2016 campaign, especially in the early days, Trump and his small team of advisers would just hop on “Trump Force One,” as they had dubbed his private plane, and fly around the country — almost always returning to the comfort of his Manhattan tower every evening. But now, the logistics of moving the president, along with his Secret Service detail, are far more complicated.

Trump had flirted with presidential runs before, using the drama and media attention to boost his business endeavors. So when he again began talking about a White House bid, just about everyone was skeptical. Sam Nunberg, one of his first campaign hires who was later fired, recalled having to beg mainstream reporters and conservative pundits alike to take his word that the planned Trump Tower announcement was, in fact, the start of a serious presidential campaign.

Hope Hicks — who at the time handled publicity for the Trump Organization and would eventually become the White House communications director — wasn’t sure what Trump was talking about when he called her into his office to tell her he was headed to Iowa and wanted her to be the press secretary for his campaign.

There was reason to have doubts. Planning for the launch started in earnest about a month out, and at the time, Trump had only committed to traveling to Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina. The idea was to announce his candidacy and then assess how he was doing at the end of the summer.

But Lewandowski wanted a more professional backdrop, including a sparse stage with draping and a row of crisp American flags. “I said we are going to make sure it looks like Donald Trump is running for president of the United States, down to the blue suit and white shirt,” Lewandowski said. Nunberg said Trump was initially wearing a black suit but changed into a blue one because “he told me it was going to go better with the flags.”

Katy Tur, who ended up as one of NBC’s main Trump correspondents in 2016 and now hosts her own TV show on MSNBC, was assigned to his campaign on a whim. At the time, she was a foreign correspondent based in London who happened to be back in the newsroom for a visit. She was sent out to cover Trump for what everyone assured her was, at most, a six-week stint.

Tur said she was eager to get a taste of campaign life, which she had never experienced, but also joked that she feared the assignment showed that her bosses didn’t view her as someone with serious political chops. “It’s not like they’re saying, ‘Katy, go cover Jeb Bush or Marco Rubio or Ted Cruz,’ ” she recalled. “It was like, ‘Katy, go cover this P.R. stunt for a little while.’ ”"
104,3,"One of the wildest off-seasons the NBA might ever see began long before the actual NBA season was over.

It really started one night last month when league officials and team executives locked themselves in a hotel ballroom to watch a bunch of ping-pong balls. These inanimate objects that decide the order of the NBA draft were about to determine the future of the league."
105,3,"At the end of a recent meal, while waiting for my credit card to be bruised by an area restaurant, a dinner companion and I decided to pass the time by engaging in a thought experiment. The topic: had the two hamburger dinners we’d just eaten been a prudent use of $110. Yes, the burgers had been delicious; yes, we’d also had drinks and apps; yes, the conversation was lively. But was it $110 lively? Should I have spent the evening with my friend or bought a 32-inch TV? If we’d had a nightcap, could I have paid off my car?

It’s grumblings like these that have created an opening for restaurants like Snaps, which after 15 years spent cultivating a loyal following in Wantagh, opened a second eatery in Rockville Centre in January. There, on any Thursday evening, a large, exceptional burger can be had — a half-pound blend of house-ground chuck, hanger steak and short rib meat — for the say-what-now price of five dollars. Five. If this doesn’t forever change the face of Thursday nights in Rockville Centre, I don’t know what will.

To dismiss such deals as a come-on — Snaps also has a $5 fried chicken night on Wednesday, and a $5 chicken taco night on Tuesday — is to misunderstand the aggrieved state in which the dining public increasingly finds itself. Even as more of us eat out more often than ever, prices at fine dining establishments only rise, as does our disenchantment with them, provoking a backlash and creating an opening for chef Scott Bradley and his wife, Patty, Snaps’ owners.

So why is the place packed on Friday evenings, when there are no $5 deals? Because of Snaps’ ingenuity at converting one-offs into subscribers. They come for the deals, but come back for the excellent wait service and extensive menu, for a kitchen that’s lightning fast and rarely screws up. Does this explain why diners happily fork over $36 for Snaps’ marquee rib-eye steak with rosemary garlic potatoes? No. The high-quality beef aged in-house and perfectly cooked has much to do with it. But Snaps’ consistency and professionalism are not to be overlooked.

In such an atmosphere, most everything tastes better than it has a right to — the chicken Parmesan sandwich, for instance, its tight focaccia construction exploding with tomato sauce and mozzarella lava flowing toward a side of spaghetti. A delectable pancetta-flecked risotto helps you forgive the underseasoned salmon atop it, a flavorful cup of au jus does the same for a desiccated pork sandwich.

Like most menus these days, Bradley’s gallops madly through many of the world’s cuisines, yet only the schmancy stuff seems truly out of place. A gloppy finger sandwich of lobster topped by a fried egg topped by arugula tastes even odder than it sounds when served in Snaps’ fun, almost aggressively informal dining room (Mason jar light fixtures, specials unfurling from a wall-mounted roll of butcher paper). Then again, the blue cheese and short rib quesadilla, schmancy in the extreme, is as terrific as Snaps’ tarted-up, non-5-buck burger offerings. My favorite: the Cali, a thick spackling of caramelized onions, prosciutto and spreadable goat cheese that some might call life-changing without meaning it. I, however, do.

Chickpea fries are here to stay and there’s no pretending otherwise, so you might as well make the best of it and enjoy Bradley’s Jenga-size pieces with a few bewitching squirts of olive aioli. The same goes for the now dangerously ubiquitous churro, which Snaps imagines as a flaming hot cinnamon stick doused with a blob of mocha ice cream, and I imagine you’ll fight everyone at the table for.

Don’t get me wrong. There will always be things that puzzle me about the place, and I don’t mean the bacon mustard Brussels sprouts, which actually cleverly tame that bitter brassica, or the overly messy shrimp po'boy. Nope, it’s stuff like those juicy chicken teriyaki wontons served in the cute Chinese takeout box, that cuteness marred by a flavorless blob of soba within.

And yet, even as I mused over these miscues at Snaps’ bar one afternoon, my reservations about the place seemed to magically melt away, leaving nothing but admiration in their wake. Five-dollar happy hour martinis will do that to you."
106,3,"The internet exploded in fury recently when Attorney General Jeff Sessions quoted the Bible to defend his policies in separating migrant children from their families at the U.S.-Mexico border.

""I would cite you to the Apostle Paul and his clear and wise command in Romans 13, to obey the laws of the government because God has ordained them for the purpose of order,"" Sessions said, when defending President Trump's ""zero tolerance"" immigration policy. ""Orderly and lawful processes are good in themselves. Consistent and fair application of the law is in itself a good and moral thing, and that protects the weak and protects the lawful.""

The passage in question, chapter 13 of the Apostle Paul's Letter to the Romans, reads, in part: ""Let every person be subject to the governing authorities; for there is no authority except from God, and those authorities that exist have been instituted by God. Therefore whoever resists authority resists what God has appointed, and those who resist will incur judgment.""

Some people, mostly secularists unfamiliar with the Bible, took the passage to mean that Christians should just obey any government, no matter how awful. Other people, mainly Christians, argued that Sessions is full of it, because the Bible clearly preaches an open-door immigration policy.

They're both wrong. And it's important to understand why.

The Bible is a tricky text to interpret. Some people think this is because it's a grab bag of various texts from many centuries; you can make that argument, but there's no important text from human history that is straightforward to interpret, probably because otherwise, people wouldn't find them so interesting, and they wouldn't tell us interesting things about this messy reality we inhabit. The Bible is unclear, but so are Plato's dialogues, Shakespeare's plays, and the Constitution of the United States.

But there's another reason the Bible is so tricky to understand: While there are so many Christian splinter groups and eccentrics that you can always find someone somewhere who argued something or other, the broad tradition of mainstream Christian orthodoxy has held that Christian doctrine ""works"" by holding seemingly-contradictory beliefs together. Thus, the Bible at times seems to suggest that Jesus was a human being like anybody else, and at other times that he was divine; at times, it seems to suggest that there is only one God, and at others that there is God the Father, God the Son, and God the Spirit. Which is it? ""Both,"" Christianity answers.

And this is true when it comes to Romans 13, which is both a very complex and a very important piece of Biblical text. Some reacted to its seeming message (""Bow to the State!"") with allergy. Thus we get headlines like ""Sessions cites Bible passage used to defend slavery in defense of separating immigrant families,"" which is rather like those people who say you shouldn't listen to Richard Wagner because he was Hitler's favorite composer.

Like everything else in this world, Romans 13 makes sense within its broader context. And in the New Testament, this broader context is a big, raised middle finger at the government of the day, the Roman Empire. After all, Rome killed Jesus. And Paul is not short of contempt for the Roman Empire, which he likens to Old Testament-enemies of the Jews like Pharaoh and Babylon, and even at one points asserts that it is controlled by the Devil. So much for government worship.

So, what the heck? Well, Paul writes Romans 13 to say basically two things: First, just because the Roman Empire, and indeed most governments, are awful, doesn't mean that all government in principle is bad. And secondly, he wants to tell his audience that, while they should hold the Roman Empire in contempt and resist it however they can, they should not do so by breaking the law.

The first point, like Jesus' famous line about giving back to Caesar, is important, and not just because progressives who would like to strike it out because of its historic association with all sorts of government misdeeds should remember that it's also the justification for all the government programs they like. But because, even as it legitimizes government, it downgrades it. Again, you have to get the Roman Empire context: In Rome, government wasn't just absolute, it was literally divine. ""Roma"" was a goddess; all public offices were also religious offices; and executions for high crimes were sacrifices to the gods. So Romans 13 puts government back in its place: Yes, God wants there to be governments because otherwise we would have anarchy, but governments aren't divine. They're just institutions for raising taxes and maintaining public order.

The second point — to resist without breaking the law — is important, too, because it tells us that Paul was inventing something utterly unprecedented: peaceful resistance to an unjust government. Resist Rome, but be good citizens. The mode of interacting with public authority that Jesus first modeled, but that Paul and the other early leaders of the Church implemented, would be the blueprint for future successful nonviolent resistance movements, like Gandhi's and Martin Luther King Jr.'s.

So was Sessions justified in his little exegesis? Well, yes and no. In an important sense, yes, because Romans 13 means government in general is good, and it is impossible to have a functioning government without borders and enforcing those borders. This is important because too many Christians cite the Bible's many verses enjoining ""kindness to the stranger"" as if they were a Biblical warrant for an open-door policy. But they're not. What's more, Romans 13 also means that civil servants have a duty to faithfully apply the law, and as attorney general, Sessions' job description isn't to put into application what he thinks would be good policy, but what is actually on the books.

At the same time, Sessions was clearly disingenuous. Separating migrant families goes beyond just applying the law. More broadly, in practice, and by design, attorneys general have a lot of flexibility in how they apply the law, and Sessions clearly gets a kick out of applying it in a highly restrictionist way. After all, there is no formal law requiring children to be separated from their families. Also, Christians who don't want to apply laws they deem unjust do have an option: resign. To Trump's occasional chagrin, Sessions doesn't seem to have considered that. And everybody knows why: He's putting immigration restrictions in place not because he's a civil servant who puts his own wishes aside and dutifully follows the rules, but because he believes them to be greatly desirable. So if he wants to defend his actions based on the Bible, he should defend the merits of his actions, rather than hide behind Romans 13.

But this little skirmish might have served some purpose, by drawing attention to what the Bible says about immigration policy. America's immigration policy for more than 20 years has been to have one set of written laws and another set of unwritten ones, making a mockery of the rule of law and playing no small part in the delegitimization of the political process that has empowered demagogues like Trump. When Sessions, expounding on Romans 13, said that applying the law protects both the weak and the lawful, he might have been disingenuous with regard to his own actions, but he was certainly right in general. So, there's a lesson here for both sides: Just as conservatives need to wrestle with the plainly clear Biblical verses about sympathy to the stranger, progressives need to account for the clear Biblical verses about the necessity for sound government and rule of law."
107,3,"“You can panic,” reads the subject line of one fake sextortion email.

Another has a victim’s real password in the subject line, in an attempt to establish authenticity.

These low-tech frauds spiked in 2018, according to the FBI’s Internet Crime Compliant Center (IC3), netting millions for scammers.

Last year, electronic extortion complaints rose 242% to 51,146 reported crimes, with total losses of $83 million.

While the FBI does not break out sextortion from the total number of extortion crimes reported, a spokesperson told CNBC, “The majority of extortion complaints received in 2018 were part of a sextortion campaign in which victims received an email threatening to send a pornographic video of them or other compromising information to family, friends, coworkers or social network contacts if a ransom was not paid.”

'Sextortion' by inmates: Army veteran was targeted just before his suicide

The advice from experts: Don’t fall for it.

“They play on our basest levels of psychology,” said Priya Sopori, partner at law firm Greenberg Gluster and a former assistant U.S. attorney who prosecuted cybercrimes, including sextortion.

“You will read personalization into any generic statement. And if you believe that there are hackers out there that know every aspect of your life, and maybe they even know your life better than you do, you might actually pay even if you’ve done nothing at all.”

While there are examples of real sextortion, especially involving the theft of real nude photos or videos, hoax sextortion emails have no basis in reality.

Scammers send these emails out as form letters. They include claims about supposed improprieties, often including claims that the sender has evidence of your affairs, has hacked your webcam to take damning photos or videos of you or has evidence of pornographic material you’ve viewed.

Here’s a sample letter, courtesy of antivirus software company Malwarebytes, which researches this and other scams:

I am well aware [REDACTED] is your pass words. Lets get right to point. Neither anyone has paid me to investigate you. You may not know me and you are probably thinking why you’re getting this e-mail? actually, i installed a software on the adult videos (pornographic material) web-site and do you know what, you visited this website to have fun (you know what i mean). While you were viewing videos, your web browser began working as a Remote Desktop that has a keylogger which gave me accessibility to your display and also cam. Just after that, my software gathered every one of your contacts from your Messenger, Facebook, as well as email . after that i created a double video. 1st part displays the video you were viewing (you’ve got a nice taste haha), and next part shows the recording of your cam, yeah its you. You have not one but two choices. Shall we read up on these options in aspects: First alternative is to just ignore this message. in such a case, i am going to send out your actual video to every single one of your personal contacts and think regarding the awkwardness you will definitely get. and definitely if you happen to be in a loving relationship, how it would affect? Number 2 solution is to pay me $889. Lets name it as a donation. in this situation, i most certainly will asap remove your video footage. You could carry on daily life like this never occurred and you surely will never hear back again from me.

“First, have a healthy level of skepticism,” said Malwarebytes CEO Marcin Kleczynski.

“Then, remember, they almost certainly haven’t been recording you or have access to this type of information, if it even exists.”

His company has looked at bitcoin wallets associated with criminals perpetrating these schemes, Kleczynski said, where criminals ask victims to send what are often unusual sums – $514, $607 and $618 in three recent examples. Apparently they spark enough panic to net the criminals $10,000 to $20,000 per week, according to Malwarebytes research.

Hunting online: This is how 9 sexual predators got hundreds of girls to trust them

“There is an incredibly low barrier of entry here. It’s a commodity attack,” he said. Criminals don’t need any hacking skills at all to pull off sextortion. They can simply rely on leaked email addresses stolen from huge companies and email providers in the last decade.

In the slightly more sophisticated version of the crime, scammers buy “dirt cheap” passwords associated with those emails and include the password in the subject line as an additional lure, falsely claiming they have used the password to access sensitive information about you.

But it’s all fake. The only reason it works so well, Sopori said, is because “people, especially young people, have come to believe there’s no such thing as privacy anymore.” This belief leads people to assume that anyone can spy on them at any time or can even misuse their information to create the appearance of impropriety where it doesn’t exist.

“So it does seem to indicate that, when hear that people don’t care about privacy anymore, the success of these scams tells us the opposite might be true,” Sopori said. “People obviously do care about privacy. They do care about the idea that someone could have pictures of you, and they believe the threats that ‘I will send them to your brothers, your sisters, your friends.’ Privacy is still important. Shame can be a tremendous weapon that these criminals use.”

What you can do

Besides having a healthy level of skepticism – it is highly, highly unlikely anyone sending one of these emails knows you or has information on you, Kleczynski emphasizes – checking and updating your spam filters can also help, to make sure those filters are catching the latest versions of these scams.

Avoid falling victim: That $10,000 check in the mail is likely just a scam

Changing passwords or using a password manager can also help, so that you can rest assured any passwords displayed in an alarming subject line are no longer in use. Multifactor authentication, which gives you the option of using other methods to log in other than passwords, can also help ease worries about passwords, he recommends

If you receive an email and it worries you, you can report it to your company’s IT department or local police – who are well-aware of these scams, Sopori said. You can also report the emails to the FBI’s IC3.

108,3,"A student who survived the 2018 mass school shooting in Parkland, Fla., and went on to become an outspoken advocate for gun rights said Harvard University rescinded his admission earlier this month after his past racist remarks came to light.

Early Monday morning, Kyle Kashuv posted on Twitter that the school made the decision “over texts and comments made nearly two years ago.”

A Harvard spokeswoman, Rachel Dane, said the school doesn’t comment on admissions decisions but said the school reserves the right to rescind admissions decisions.

Last month, several media outlets published comments made by Mr. Kashuv in texts to friends that contained racial slurs. At the time, Mr. Kashuv apologized on Twitter for his comments, which he said were made when he was 16 years old."
109,3,"Hepatitis C was in the rearview mirror.

A drug approved in 2014 was found to be so effective in quashing the virus that doctors around the world breathed a sigh of relief. The World Health Organization even projected its total eradication by 2030.

Then, shockingly, the number of new hep-C cases started to rise. From 2010 to 2016, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports the number of those afflicted with the viral disease, which slowly attacks the liver, more than tripled.

Experts say the reason for the sudden rise is simple: “Opioids, in a word,” says Dr. Douglas Dieterich, a gastroenterologist at Mount Sinai. He says the disease is one of the quieter ripple effects of the escalating drug crisis — quieter, but no less devastating: Hepatitis C symptoms are few and, unchecked, the disease, can lead to liver cancer.

“Starting around 2015, I would see 20-something women from New Jersey who had started using IV heroin, which they got at the mall. It was cheaper than a latte,” Dieterich tells The Post. “I don’t think they ever even considered hep C.”

Dieterich — who was involved in the clinical trials that yielded the approval of the 2014 cure — is a survivor of the virus himself, after accidentally pricking himself with a patient’s hep-c infected needle when he was a medical student in 1977. Each year, he throws an annual “cure party” for the increasing number of patients he and his staff have screened and given hepatitis C treatment. Last month, about 50 patients and their family members tearfully shared news of their fresh start.

“It was a long journey, but all’s well that ends well,” says Bobby Rossillo, who lived with the disease for 30 years. Added another patient: “I’m not walking around with a ticking time bomb in me any more.”

Hep C is increasingly affecting young people who get it from infected needles, often for injectable drugs, but sometimes from tattoo needles. But doctors like Dieterich are especially concerned about another part of the population — pregnant women. A hepatitis-infected mother has up to a 7% chance of passing on the disease to her child, which could multiply hepatitis C’s already exponential growth.

Kaitlyn McDonald, 26, became pregnant last January, about a year after getting clean from a heroin addiction. It wasn’t until she was at a routine checkup in her first trimester that she learned her drug use had left her with hepatitis C.

“I was totally blindsided by it,” says the unmarried Long Island mom, whose drug use lasted from 2012 through 2017 and had her in and out of rehab.

For moms like her, the thought of passing down the disease is gut-wrenching.

“It’s so much guilt, and thinking about your past actions,” says McDonald, who was lucky in one respect: Her infant son didn’t contract the illness.

Mount Sinai has been screening pregnant women like her and Antoinette Wheeler, a housing authority worker in her second trimester. The 38-year-old Harlem resident believes she contracted the disease from an at-home tattoo a friend gave her.

“It was shocking,” Wheeler says of learning she had been infected, “but once I found out how the game has changed, I felt like this was something I could easily take care of.”

She wouldn’t have known about the cure — or even that she’d been infected — without Mount Sinai’s routine blood test, which screens for hepatitis B and C. She’ll start treatment in her third trimester, in August.

In the three years since Dieterich began throwing his parties, he estimates that about 1,000 of his hospital’s patients are now hep-C free — thanks to a pill they take just once a day, for up to 12 weeks.

Given the opioid crisis, he believes the projection to eradicate the disease in the next 10 years is “very ambitious.” Nevertheless, he hopes that those who are cured will spread the word in communities that need it.

That’s the goal of patients like Rossillo, 68, who contracted the disease when he was a drug addict. Now clean, the longtime West Villager recalls that the previous treatment for hep C had awful side effects: “It would give you these mouth lesions — I had them so bad, it came out the other side of my cheek.” He says the old treatment also decreased serotonin, the so-called “happy” chemical, leaving him angry.

Rossillo was finally cured of hep C last year, but not before he battled liver cancer. When he shares his good news with friends and those he knows still struggling with drug addiction, he encourages them to get screened for the disease.

“You don’t have to preach,” he says. “All you have to do is tell your story.”"
110,3,"Gabon’s president had not been seen for months. Out of the African country to get treatment for a stroke, Ali Bongo was rumored to be dead.

Then an odd video of him emerged on New Year’s Eve, denounced by political foes as fake. That prompted the Gabonese military to stage an unsuccessful coup.

Bongo eventually returned to Gabon, and gave his first televised speech last week.

Still unknown: Whether the video was fake or real.

Humans have long understood the power of images. They can convince and inspire — and sow political chaos.

We’ve also understood the power of mistruth, especially in politics. Hence the occupation “dirty trickster.”

Now we’re about to understand the power of fusing the visual with the lie. The era of deepfakes is upon us.

Computer-generated deepfake videos use actual footage to create a false reality. They’re ever easier to create and ever harder to detect. Cyber experts working to identify deepfakes say they’re outnumbered by those working to make them.

That’s amateur hour next to the potential of deepfakes.

A video shows a candidate using a racial slur. Or uttering obscenities. Or presenting an unpopular viewpoint.

What we’ve seen so far has been easily detectable. The fake footage of Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg boasting of his “total control of billions of people’s stolen data.” The doctored video of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to make her appear intoxicated.

The good stuff is coming. And we’re utterly unprepared, judging by expert testimony at Thursday’s House Intelligence Committee deepfake hearing.

Big Tech companies like Facebook and YouTube don’t want to play referee on what’s fake. They have different policies; Facebook says posts don’t have to be “true.” And algorithms can’t catch everything.

There is little reason to expect Congress to act. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has been blocking any election security bill, a gross dereliction of duty given Russia’s meddling in 2016. On Thursday, Republicans even blocked a bill that essentially would force campaigns to report to the FBI foreign offers of assistance — akin to asking them to report a crime.

Candidates aren’t developing the rapid-response strategies they’ll need to deal with deepfake videos. But leading Democratic contender Joe Biden vowed Friday not to use or share deepfakes, a pledge made by many of his opponents.

But not President Donald Trump, who shared the Pelosi video.

The president’s role is troubling. He blurs the line between fact and fiction, denies saying things he said, and claims he said things he never did. Now a deepfake video could “prove” him correct. And he likely would tout that.

Trump, who never misses his shot to twist something to his advantage, reportedly is saying that the “Access Hollywood” video with his boast of assaulting women was fake — proving well-founded the fears of experts that deepfake videos will let people deny the legitimacy of real videos.

And so humans will come to understand the power of images to destroy our faith in images."
111,3,"Iran’s announcement Monday that it is stepping up uranium enrichment frames almost perfectly the real story behind the rapidly escalating tensions in the Persian Gulf region. What the world is seeing isn’t so much a march toward war, but rather a battle for leverage: the considerable leverage the Trump administration has gained over Iran on the one hand, and, on the other, the leverage Iran feels it badly needs to acquire over the U.S. to balance the score.

That doesn’t mean there won’t be a war—the chances for miscalculation..."
112,3,"LE BOURGET, France — Airbus will start making a new single-aisle long-range jet, beating rival Boeing to the market in this category.

The European plane maker launched the A321XLR jet Monday at the Paris Air Show, saying it will be ready for customers in 2023 and will fly up to 4,700 miles (7,560 kilometers).

Chief salesman Christian Scherer would not say how much the plane would cost to develop, but said it would be significantly less than building a whole new plane because it is an upgraded version of the existing A321.

It was the biggest new plane announcement expected at the Paris Air Show gathering of aviation industry powerhouses.

Boeing is considering whether to build a new jet — the concept is dubbed New Midsize Airplane, or NMA — that would be close in size to the A321XLR. It would fill a gap in the Boeing lineup between the smaller 737 and the larger 777 and 787.

Right after the launch, Los Angeles-based Air Lease Corporation signed a letter of intent to buy 27 of the new Airbus planes."
113,3,"Attorney General William Barr released a four-page letter Sunday summarizing Special Counsel Robert Mueller's report, but ""the public still has not read a single complete sentence of the Mueller report,"" legal reporter Adam Klasfeld notes. Or, as Lawfare managing editor Quinta Jerecic says wryly at The Atlantic: ""No one who matters has read the Mueller report yet.""

Here are four things we still don't know about Mueller's findings:

Mueller, Barr writes, ""did not establish that members of the Trump campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities."" That has been interpreted by President Trump and many in the media as ""no collusion,"" but ""a careful reading of Barr's letter suggests that [assumption] may be wrong,"" explains national security lawyer Robert Litt at Lawfare. In fact, ""Barr's letter suggests the possibility that, rather than 'no evidence' of collusion, Mueller did find such evidence — but ... did not conclude it warranted a criminal prosecution.""

And anyway, ""there's a large gap between not being criminally liable and having done nothing wrong,"" Jonathan Bernstein notes at Bloomberg Opinion.

2. How long is the report?

Barr never even mentions how many pages Mueller submitted. ""I have no idea, and no one I've talked to has any idea or will say how long it is,"" Bob Woodward said Monday on MSNBC. ""It might be thousands of pages."" Oddly, Fox News host Todd Piro tweeted in passing Monday that Mueller's report is 675 pages long.

3. What about the counterintelligence part?

Mueller's office subsumed an FBI counterintelligence investigation into whether Trump was acting as a Russian agent. ""It's still not clear what became of that counterintelligence probe after Mueller was appointed, and Barr did not indicate in his four-page summary how far the special counsel pursued it,"" Natasha Bertrand writes at The Atlantic. Barr's summary focuses entirely on any potential violation of federal criminal statutes, but the counterintelligence inquiry would explore if Russia has compromising information on Trump — or maybe provide other explanations for Trump's extraordinary affinity for Russian President Vladimir Putin.

NBC News reports that the FBI will brief Congress' ""Gang of Eight"" on Mueller's counterintelligence findings within the next month or two.

Mueller explicitly did not ""exonerate"" Trump of obstruction of justice charges, and Barr decided there was no obstruction based on Mueller's evidence. He did not explain either conlcusion. ""Most"" — but not all — of the evidence of possible obstruction has been ""the subject of public reporting,"" Barr wrote, and ""many"" of the suspect incidents ""took place in public view.""

The New York Times explores several of the questions raised by Mueller and Barr's unusual decisions, including whether Mueller wanted Barr or Congress and the public to weigh his evidence, and whether he felt constrained by the Justice Department policy that a president can't be indicted or Barr's stated view that presidents can't obstruct justice in the ways Trump might have done. Also, Lawfare's Jerecic asks, ""to what extent did that view mean that Barr wrote off presidential conduct that the FBI worried might be both obstructive and a benefit to Russia — such as firing James Comey as FBI director?""

It's still not clear whether Barr will ever release any of Mueller's report. Peter Baker at the Times reports the Justice Department says ""it will have its own summary ready to send to lawmakers within weeks,"" suggesting Congress and the public may not even get a redacted version of Mueller's conclusions. But it is abundantly clear that we know only slightly more about what Mueller did find than we did a week ago, and as Mueller watcher Marcy Wheeler writes, ""Barr has already failed the test of whether he can summarize Mueller's results in good faith."""
114,3,"Summer’s here, so it’s the perfect time to crack open a nice cold beer here in the Big Apple.

Indeed, most of us can afford to have a lot of cold ones this summer in New York and in the region. That’s because the Empire State — which is usually top of list when it comes to taxing things — actually has some of the lowest beer taxes in the nation. And neighboring states also apparently like suds.

That frothy analysis comes from a new report from the Tax Foundation.

In the report, New York ranked 11th-lowest in beer taxes, at 14 cents per gallon. New Jersey was eighth, at just 12 cents. Pennsylvania had the fourth-lowest brew levy, at 8 cents. Connecticut’s tax was 23 cents.

The national beer tax average is 33.1 cents per gallon, according to the Tax Foundation.

Why are New York and the Northeast for once in the low end of the tax bracket?

“The Northeast has a high concentration of breweries and there is a tendency of these states to protect their industries,” said Katherine Loughead, a policy analyst with the Tax Foundation.

She added that the same trend can be seen in otherwise high-tax California. There, lawmakers protect their local industry and keep wine taxes low.

These taxes, which are levied at various points of beer production and distribution, can be important, especially for those price-conscious beer guzzlers who are having more than one.

That’s because, according to the Beer Institute, “Taxes are the single most expensive ingredient in beer, costing more than labor and materials.”

But if you really want to get sloshed on a budget, then head for the Grand Tetons.

The Tax Foundation says that Wyoming, home of the mountain range, has the lowest beer taxes in the nation — just 2 cents per gallon."
115,3,"WASHINGTON — The Agriculture Department announced on Thursday that it planned to relocate two scientific divisions to the Kansas City region from Washington, despite resistance from career staff members and concern that the move will erode the quality of research at the agency.

More than 500 jobs will shift across the country as the department moves its Economic Research Service and National Institute of Food and Agriculture with the intent of bringing research closer to the agricultural communities that it serves. The move is projected to save the department nearly $300 million over 15 years.

“The Kansas City region has proven itself to be a hub for all things agriculture and is a booming city in America’s heartland,” Sonny Perdue, the agriculture secretary, said on Thursday.

The move follows a nearly yearlong process to find a new home for the divisions. Plans for the relocation have generated a backlash from employees who have been fearful about their jobs being moved and who have speculated that the Trump administration is trying to stifle research that at times has clashed with its political agenda."

117,3,"The Russia collusion suspicions were fueled entirely by Trump and his campaign. The ABC News foreign 'dirt' interview shows he hasn't learned a thing.

A lot of people are outraged by President Donald Trump’s admission last week that he would happily accept dirt on a political opponent from a foreign government. I’m not outraged though, or even particularly upset. This is nothing new. Trump has said as much over and over again. Almost a year ago, he tweeted about the infamous Trump Tower meeting with Russians promising dirt on Hillary Clinton, “This was a meeting to get information on an opponent, totally legal and done all the time in politics.”

What I am is frightened. After two years of being hectored, lectured and dragged over the coals, Trump has learned absolutely nothing. Worse, he doesn’t appear to have the capacity or desire to learn anything. Most people learn pretty quickly about touching a hot stove. In Trump’s case, his campaign’s efforts to get a foreign government to give him dirt on a political opponent have been more like licking a frozen flagpole — incredibly stupid and hard to escape.

Trump’s constant complaints about being suspected of colluding with the Russians were entirely fueled by Trump and his own campaign. Who can forget the news conference where he encouraged the Russians to hack into Clinton’s servers and steal her emails? Donald Trump Jr.’s giddy acceptance of an apparent offer from the Russian government promising dirt on Clinton and her campaign? George Papadopoulos bragging to an Australian diplomat that Russia had Clinton’s emails, which is how the inquiry that became the Mueller investigation got started in the first place?

Wanted, a patriotic president: Trump invites foreigners to distort 2020 elections. Why won't he protect his own country?

Apparently, it’s Trump himself who forgets all these things and the fallout that came with them. The Mueller report isn’t a vindication of Trump’s conduct. Under the most imaginative pro-Trump reading possible, it’s still a dire warning. Trump and his campaign avoided a felony conspiracy with the Russian government by pure dumb luck.

When a furor erupted over his comments to ABC News last week, Trump tried and failed to walk them back: “Of course” he’d look at the information, but “of course” he’d report it to law enforcement — “if I thought anything was incorrect or badly stated.” But it has been explained to him time and time again: Whether or not you report it to the FBI, which even Steve Bannon agrees is the only decent, American thing to do, accepting compromising information about a political opponent from a foreign government is a crime that can earn you up to five years in a federal prison. This is not a controversial position. The FBI says so. Even Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, a staunch Trump ally, says so.

'I would not have thought I needed to say this'

In the words of Ellen Weintraub, the head of the Federal Election Commission (appointed by Republican George W. Bush, if it matters), “Let me make something 100% clear to the American public and anyone running for public office: It is illegal for any person to solicit, accept, or receive anything of value from a foreign national in connection with a U.S. election.” She introduced the statement on Twitter with: “I would not have thought that I needed to say this.”

If the Trump campaign had succeeded in its desperate quest to get the Russian government to turn over dirt on Clinton, a lot more people from the Trump campaign would be in prison today, including Donald Trump Jr. Most people would be sobered by such a near-death experience. Not Trump.

Honor among partisans: Trump calls foreign intelligence 'oppo research.' I call it illegal, and I should know.

“It’s not interference. They have information. I think I’d take it. If I thought there was something wrong, I’d go maybe to the FBI, if I thought there was something wrong. But when somebody comes up with oppo research, right, they come up with oppo research.”

I can almost hear people shrugging. “Oh, that’s just Trump being Trump! You have to take him seriously, not literally.” Sorry, but no. When the president says something like this, it has consequences. Here’s what Kayleigh McEnany, speaking for Trump’s reelection campaign, had to say on Thursday evening about following the president’s ""directives"" about campaign assistance from a foreign government.

“We follow his lead. The president is our leader, we follow everything he says, his directives,"" McEnany told CBSN. ""President Trump is the communications director. He’s the political director. He’s the leader of our campaign. So we follow and echo what he says.”

Most unfortunately, Trump also seems to be the campaign’s legal director. In plain language, Trump instructed his campaign to commit a felony, and the spokesperson for the campaign responded, “Yes, my leader!” I cannot think of a single more chilling thing I have ever seen in modern American political discourse. In the words of Don McGahn, the president’s ex-White House counsel, Trump is asking his people to do “crazy sh--.” But unlike McGahn, they no longer have the moral intelligence to say no.

Usually, I like to end this sort of things with a suggestion about what can be done to fix the problem. But this time, I’ve got nothing. We have a president who can’t or won't learn from his mistakes and a large group of people fanatically devoted to that president who can no longer tell right from wrong. Trump isn’t going to get better. He only makes the people around him worse. I genuinely do not know what the solution is. But I do know that we had better find one.

119,3,"Just before the start of Memorial Day weekend, Meg Green meticulously followed online instructions for hacking an insulin pump.

Why? To make the small, computerized device smarter by giving it the capability to adjust itself, acting as an artificial external pancreas.

The hack worked, unlocking a world free of the constant blood sugar monitoring and insulin adjusting that became routine for the 26-year-old with Type 1 diabetes.

""I went out for drinks, and the pump automatically knew how much insulin to give me. I was stable all night,” Green said about the jailbroken device. ""It was amazing, I just wanted to cry.""

Diabetes treatment has come a long way over the past few years as technology has evolved.

The professional medical community has developed gadgets equipped with sensors and wireless connectivity that can track blood sugar levels. There’s tech that remotely connects patients with health care providers and even wearables that can deliver medication into the body.

How to stay safe online? We asked the 'Father of the internet'

Burnout is officially a medical condition: Here's what the World Health Organization has to say

As some people invest in the latest advancements to help them cope with the disease, others have found unconventional ways to manage blood sugar conditions like hacking into insulin pumps.

Three separate technologies – including a continuous blood glucose monitor, an insulin pump and a computerized control system – have been used for decades to help people with diabetes manually manage their health.

However, in recent years, a loose network of ""aggressive patients"" began exploiting a security flaw in some of the pumps to make them automatically estimate blood glucose levels and adjust insulin levels accordingly, according to Dr. Irl B. Hirsch, a professor of medicine at the University of Washington Medical Center.

""We’ve seen hacking in politics, and now we're seeing it in medicines,"" Hirsch said.

The endocrinologist said that thousands of people with diabetes are breaking into the medical devices because they ""don’t want to wait for the FDA to approve something from the usual stream of regulation.""

He said the hacked pumps give users ""smoother glucose levels than we can get right now with the approved devices.""

Glucose is the type of sugar you get from foods, and insulin helps keeps your blood sugar level from getting too high (hyperglycemia). Diabetes inhibits the body's ability to produce or manage insulin appropriately, causing glucose to build up.

Dana Lewis, an Alabama native, is one of the pioneers in the field of DIY insulin pumping.

In 2014, she used a custom program to unlock the real-time blood sugar readings from her insulin pump and created an algorithm that can predict what her blood sugar is going to be in the future. She then met with Ben West, who is one of the key hackers behind the artificial pancreas movement, and ""a light bulb went off,"" Lewis said.

She posted the code online, calling it OpenAPS, and made it widely available to anyone who wanted to unlock their insulin pumps. OpenAPS is an acronym for open artificial pancreas system.

""I wanted to share my solution with other people. From the beginning, it was a patient-driven movement of people who say, 'I want to have choices.'"" Lewis said. ""This was all about how do we fill the gap until there’s something commercially available.""

It saved my life': Apple Watch, Fitbit are notifying users of medical emergencies

As of May, thousands of people worldwide are using the hybrid strategy, Lewis said.

Experts say the practice feeds an underground used-insulin-pump market, which sees users buying obsolete medical devices that have known security vulnerabilities.

Earlier this month, the FDA warned diabetics against building their own artificial pancreas system to help control blood sugar levels after a patient using one suffered an accidental insulin overdose.

The organization said in a statement that it is ""concerned about people with diabetes using unauthorized devices for diabetes management used alone or along with authorized devices.""

Hirsh, who has a ""handful of patients"" who hacked their pumps, tells them, ""While I appreciate what you are doing, from a legal point of view I can’t be responsible for a hacked pump like I can from an FDA-approved device,"" the endocrinologist said.

""You’re using pumps that are out of warranty, or off-label, so there is no way manufacturers can back it up if there is a problem.""

Despite the dangers, the trend continues with DIYers posting tutorials on how to crack into Omipod’s latest ""Eros"" generation in April, which Green used to hack the medical device.

Green said that hacking the pump had already saved at least $850, compared to buying a new insulin pump with similar capabilities.

While people hack medical devices to access their vital signs in real time, the medical community continues to roll out new, and often expensive, products aimed at making life with diabetes more manageable.

In 2018, the FDA-cleared a Medtronic system that includes automated insulin delivery. The device costs more than $7,000 before insurance.

The diabetic supply company Tandem says it expects to release Control-IQ, an FDA approved automated insulin delivery system, toward the end of the summer.

The Dexcom G6, a wearable that monitors blood sugar via a couple of tiny prongs that penetrate just beneath the wearer’s skin, has been a life changer for 13-year-old Maxim Speed and his family.

Speed was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes six yearsf ago and has gone from carrying around a medical bag with test strips and a glucose meter to discreetly wearing the Dexcom device that transmits real-time data to his iPhone and Apple Watch.

Launched in 2018, the continuous glucose monitoring system (CGM) allows people with Type 1 diabetes to track their numbers around the clock without having to prick their fingers multiple times a day.

Maxim's father, Jermaine, said that before the Dexcom device, ""We had to wake him up a few times every night to check his blood sugar. Night time was a scary time because we didn’t know what his blood sugar was doing.""

The app has an “Urgent Low Soon” alert that can warn users and their loved ones in advance of a severe hypoglycemic event, which allows them time to take appropriate action against dangerously low blood sugar.

Still, it's only approved for people ages 6 and older. For those paying the retail price, a box of sensors, two transmitters, and the touchscreen receiver will run you over $1,000.

""I was excited to wear it because I knew it was life-changing,"" the teen said about the Dexcom G6. ""But Iit was really scary to see the applicator. It wasn’t very modern. And there was a button to push the needle in.""

He said that applying the device didn't hurt as much as finger pricks, which he no longer has to do. His father said watching other kids apply the device on YouTube made the transition to Dexcom's wearable gadgets easier for Maxim.

With the rise in diabetes-treating wearable medical devices has come an increase in remote monitoring systems that collect data that doctors can use to provide better-informed treatment programs.

Using specialized smartphone apps, people with diabetes can store blood glucose data in a remote portal that's hosted in a health clinic or hospital. This information can be accessed and viewed by a physician.

In fact, 68% of physicians say that they intend to use patient monitoring tech, like continuous monitoring and smartwatches to manage their patients’ health, according to a new study from the Consumer Technology Association.

The survey revealed the benefits of using remote patient monitoring, which include improved patient outcomes, improved compliance rates and patients taking more ownership of their health.

""Device-derived data from multiple sources can create a more holistic picture of how a person’s activities and behaviors impact their health,"" said Joel Goldsmith, senior director of digital platforms at Abbott.

The data gathered by wearables ""can help them, and their doctors, see patterns over time and have better understanding of glycemic patterns, impact of diet and physical activity on glucose levels, and identify when there might be a risk of high or low blood sugar."""
120,3,"Erin McKenna taught herself to bake after she discovered as a child that she couldn’t eat most desserts she encountered in the world.

“I had all those allergies,” she said.

Her early experiments — “I was just throwing stuff in a bowl” — eventually led to her developing her own gluten-free and vegan recipes and, in 2005, to opening her own bakery.

That was in New York City (the bakery was then called Babycakes; after a copyright dispute she renamed that and all other locations Erin McKenna’s Bakery). On Saturday, she’ll open a Santa Monica shop, her second Los Angeles-area location.

The new Montana Avenue bakery (her first L.A. location is in Larchmont Village) is done up in shades of pink and lavender, with eight tables and chairs and banquette seating in a cozy dining area in front of cases and shelves loaded with baked goods.

It’s a significant expansion, as McKenna’s previous bakeries only have bar seating. Also new is a breakfast menu featuring pancakes, waffles and French toast; and a savory menu that includes pizza, salads, roasted vegetables, mac and cheese, and avocado toast.

“My mission wasn’t just to give kids a bakery where they could eat anything,” McKenna said recently, dressed in her bakery’s pink jumpsuit uniform, next to stacks of frosted doughnuts, “but to give them a frickin’ cool bakery.”

The new location will also have beer and wine, with a selection put together by Ferdinando Mucerino, a longtime customer who helped McKenna assemble an organic vegan wine selection.

One of 12 children, McKenna grew up in San Diego and lived in New York before she decided last year to return to Southern California with her husband and their three children to be close to her extended family, and to open a new bakery here.

“The loudest message I got was ‘open in L.A.,’” McKenna said. “Los Angeles is light years ahead of New York in cutting-edge health.”

Her bakery is “not a diet bakery,” she said, but rather one that provides products for people who have long been underserved. “It’s not a trend.”"
121,3,"The measure of ""fun"" is subjective. But that doesn't stop us from trying. To that end, WalletHub released its 2019 ranking of most fun states in America on Monday.

For the ranking, the personal finance website compared fun in the 50 U.S. states using 26 weighted metrics related to entertainment, recreation and nightlife. Criteria included the number of restaurants and specific attractions per capita, the average cost for entertainment (such as movies and alcohol), along with personal and government spending on recreation.

California tops the list of most fun states. That's no surprise given that WalletHub says it has the most movie theaters and restaurants per capita.

Rounding out the top five are Florida, New York, Washington and Colorado, in that order.

According to the ranking, West Virginia is the least fun state in the union. The mountain state didn't perform well in several criteria: It had the fewest performing-arts theaters per capita (behind Mississippi) and fewest fitness centers per capita (behind Hawaii). West Virginia also tied for lowest variety of arts, entertainment and recreational establishments.

Also toward the bottom of the list are Vermont, Rhode Island, Delaware and Mississippi, ranked 46 through 49, respectively.

122,3,"Years ago, I had to give my mother heartbreaking news about my brother's death. This year, I'm pushing for changes for incarcerated women.

On November 5th, 2017 in the early morning hours, I received a frantic phone call. My sister-in-law was crying hysterically. She shared that my 50-year-old brother had been rushed to the emergency room. Within the next hour, I would discover that my brother had died from a massive heart attack. Just like that, our beloved brother, father, son, husband was gone.

After getting over the initial shock, my next thought was: How can I tell this to my mother?

My mother, Patricia Sullivan, was approximately seven months into a 48-month federal prison sentence for wire fraud. Would she be able to handle this news? Would my mother be allowed to attend the funeral? So many questions raced through my mind.

I rushed home from the hospital and told my husband that we needed to go to Florida to break the news face-to-face. At the time my mother was being held at Federal Correctional Institution Marianna. The drive was more than 360 miles. It was a Sunday. We had to hurry.

On the way, I called the federal prison. I explained what happened and asked if there was a room where I could share this unexpected tragic news. They said no. There were no rooms or accommodations that they could make. I asked if there was a set protocol or procedure, but they had nothing of significance to offer. The chaplain was not on duty.

When my mom saw that we had come to visit, she was so excited. That elation would quickly turn to devastation. Out in the open, with other families visiting their incarcerated family members, I would break the news. I would tell my mother that her oldest son had passed away. That day I heard my mother weep in a way that I had never heard before. My mother who had always been a pillar of strength, broke completely down and wept aloud.

She would get to travel South Carolina for my brother’s funeral. There were numerous prayers sent up on her behalf. She was one of the first, if not the first person, that the warden of the prison allowed to travel on furlough. The furlough only allowed for the service itself, so we would miss my brother’s military burial and instead leave immediately after the service to drive back to Florida.

Now, 18 months later, I’m preparing to visit my mother on Mother’s Day. I have sent her 30 Mother’s Day cards individually packaged from family members and friends. I’m working strategically to build a network of women who will surround her, support her, and assist her with rebuilding her life. One of her goals is to promote prison reform.

There are simple adjustments that can be made to ensure that rehabilitation is a reality and not an elusive complexity. First and foremost, every prison should have an educational and/or career development program for inmates. This should be a basic requirement. Second, there should be an established protocol to provide privacy for families dealing with death and other serious tragedies. Third, protocols and guidelines need to be in place to keep families and next-of-kin aware when impending storms threaten the lives and/or safety of loved ones. My mother was trapped in her prison during Hurricane Michael. And last, prisons should partner with faith-based institutions to offer activities that cultivate an environment of humanization, hope and positivity for the nation’s incarcerated.

Out of all of the money that gets funneled through our nation’s prisons, as a nation we have to do more to restore dignity and hope to the nation’s incarcerated. This is particularly true of incarcerated mothers.

Happy Mother’s Day to them all."

128,3,"Students from John H. West Elementary School in Bethpage won a new playground made partly from used toothbrushes, floss, and toothpaste tubes and caps that they collected for more than a year.

The school won first place in this year’s Colgate and ShopRite Recycled Playground Challenge, in which schools earn credits through a combination of the number of online votes and the amount of recycled oral care waste, according to the contest website. “They are so proud of themselves,"" said Principal Carol Muscarella after the ribbon-cutting ceremony Tuesday. ""They feel so a part of it.""

To build the playground, used dental products and discarded packaging were combined with high-density polyethylene, said Sue Kauffman, a spokeswoman for TerraCycle, the Trenton, New Jersey-based recycling company that built the playground.

The school recycled 706.72 pounds of waste, said Kauffman. About 470 students attend the school.

John H. West's students entered the contest last year but came in seventh place, Muscarella said. That made them determined to work even harder this year, she said. They redoubled their efforts by enlisting help from students throughout the rest of the Plainedge district to collect used oral care products and packaging, she said.

“It was ahuge lesson in civics or how to lead your life,” Muscarella said. ”Don’t give up. You didn’t win. Keep going.”

132,3,"When police raided gay bars back in the day, they expected the patrons to scatter. But one hot Friday night 50 years ago, at the Stonewall Inn, no one was going anywhere. Gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender, old, young — they booed and jeered as the cops walked their prey out of the bar. Kids across the street started throwing pennies, then bricks. Finally, the riot squad was called in, and even they couldn’t clear the streets.

Martin Boyce remembers sitting on his stoop the next day, exhausted from the melee. “My God, we’re going to pay so desperately for this,” he thought. But that’s not what happened.

“The next day we were there again,” he says. “We had had enough. Every queen in that riot changed.”

On June 28, 1969, what happened at Greenwich Village’s Stonewall Inn became “Stonewall,” the legendary uprising against homophobic abuse.

The telling and retelling of the Stonewall story makes it seem like Martin Luther King Jr.’s famous arc of the moral universe isn’t long — as he claimed — but explosively short. Much of the 50th anniversary coverage of the uprising has marveled at how quickly gays won their civil rights, at how everything changed in one night when, in Boyce’s words, “We had had enough.”

But nothing about Stonewall was sudden. The homophobia was an age-old story, and the riot was the product of activism that had been building for decades. King’s quote is correct: History’s arc traces a very long line. It only bends toward justice because so many activists over so many years hammer relentlessly upon it.

The movement that erupted into a riot at Stonewall in 1969 dates back to the early 1900s, when LGBTQ people began to migrate to cities. Abuse and harassment followed them.

The repeal of Prohibition in 1933 empowered states to license liquor, and with licensing came the requirement that bars must be “orderly,” which gave authorities cover for harassing gays even in their own establishments. In the 1940s, the Red Scare became a “Lavender Scare,” as investigators applied the “subversive” label to gay men and lesbian women working for the government. The longest surviving gay resistance organization, the Mattachine Society, was founded, alongside the lesbian Daughters of Bilitis, in the early 1950s; it all but unraveled under the pressure of government scrutiny.

But in 1957, the government made a terrible mistake when it fired physicist Franklin “Frank” Kameny for being gay. Instead of going quietly, he sued. Kameny lost (the Supreme Court would not consider discrimination based on sexual orientation unconstitutional until 1996), but his fight revived the Mattachine Society. Kameny organized early gay rights protests at the White House, the Pentagon, the United Nations.

By 1969, gays who had honed their activism protesting the Vietnam War had had enough maltreatment from their straight lefty brothers. They came out and applied their politics to a new front. One of them, Carl Wittman, once a leader in Students for a Democratic Society, wrote a manifesto calling for gays to openly embrace their identity: “Stop mimicking straights, stop censoring ourselves. We have to learn that our loving each other is a good thing, not an unfortunate thing.” With exquisite timing, two other SDS alumni, Bill Katzenberg and John O’Brien, scheduled a “homosexual discussion group” at Alternate U., a free counterculture school in Greenwich Village for July 1969. It would go from five pre-Stonewall registrants to 40, post-Stonewall.

When the first stone flew at the Stonewall Inn, an architecture for the movement was already in place. Before Stonewall smaller uprisings in San Francisco and Los Angeles galvanized individuals. After Stonewall, there were meetings.

Within days, radical members of the New York Mattachine Society forced its conservative president, Dick Leitsch, to convene the group, where lesbian activist Martha Shelley stood up and invited everyone to a demonstration protesting police abuse. She soon dubbed the protest planning committee the Gay Liberation Front. Meanwhile, the Alternate U. group set an agenda and a meeting schedule and adopted the same rubric. The game was on, or more appropriately, it was continuing.

Enter the Fray: First takes on the news of the minute »

We can see a corollary to the Stonewall milestone in another explosive cultural moment. In the course of 10 days in early October 2017, seemingly out of nowhere, the New York Times and the New Yorker both exposed Harvey Weinstein’s epic sexual abuse and harassment history. Then actress Alyssa Milano shared a message: “If you’ve been sexually harassed or assaulted, write ‘me too’ as a reply to this tweet.” Overnight, #MeToo (originated by black activist Tarana Burke in 2011) echoed 55,000 times.

Presto, change-o, right? Not really.

Way back in 1974, Paulette Barnes, a brave clerk at the Environmental Protection Agency, sued a boss who had given her a choice: sex with him or lose her job. Happily, a brilliant law student, Catharine MacKinnon, was laying the theoretical groundwork to establish sexual harassment as sex discrimination — a civil rights offense. Barnes won on appeal, and MacKinnon’s theory became law. That wasn’t enough to protect Anita Hill or to make Monica Lewinsky a purely sympathetic figure. It would take another 21/2 decades, when a cadre of young feminists empowered by the internet — Andi Zeisler, Jessica Valenti, Rebecca Traister — began to insist on another “we’ve had enough” moment. Out of their ranks came the change in mindset, and some of the mainstream journalists who would break the Weinstein story.

“Stonewall” conveniently marks a movement that was a century in the making and that would go on to be honed by assassination (Harvey Milk), a deadly epidemic (AIDS) and a brilliantly strategic same-sex marriage campaign. The Weinstein revelations likewise mark a milestone for women, but to say it launched a movement isn’t exactly accurate. Gay rights and women’s rights don’t turn in an instant, no matter how galvanizing. The revolution is incremental. It takes agonizing courage, a dedicated fight, herculean perseverance. It takes time.

133,3,"The measure of ""fun"" is subjective. But that doesn't stop us from trying. To that end, WalletHub released its 2019 ranking of most fun states in America on Monday.

For the ranking, the personal finance website compared fun in the 50 U.S. states using 26 weighted metrics related to entertainment, recreation and nightlife. Criteria included the number of restaurants and specific attractions per capita, the average cost for entertainment (such as movies and alcohol), along with personal and government spending on recreation.

California tops the list of most fun states. That's no surprise given that WalletHub says it has the most movie theaters and restaurants per capita.

Rounding out the top five are Florida, New York, Washington and Colorado, in that order.

According to the ranking, West Virginia is the least fun state in the union. The mountain state didn't perform well in several criteria: It had the fewest performing-arts theaters per capita (behind Mississippi) and fewest fitness centers per capita (behind Hawaii). West Virginia also tied for lowest variety of arts, entertainment and recreational establishments.

Also toward the bottom of the list are Vermont, Rhode Island, Delaware and Mississippi, ranked 46 through 49, respectively.

Scroll through the gallery to see the top 10 most fun states, according to WalletHub, below.

Brooklyn declined to make a $3.96 qualifying offer to the 24-year-old forward, according to ESPN.com. Doing so would have kept Hollis-Jefferson in restricted free agency, allowing the Nets to match any offer sheet he signed.

Hollis-Jefferson played nearly 21 minutes per game last season, averaging 8.9 points and 5.3 rebounds on 41.1% shooting as he finished out his rookie deal. The 6-foot-7 Hollis-Jefferson is also considered a versatile defender.

The Nets, who now have $46 million in cap space, are expected to make a run at Kyrie Irving this summer, as well as another star free agent. They have enough cap space for two max deals."

139,3,"Remember when Zendaya was a teenager on the Disney Channel? Well, now she's a 22-year-old and stars in an explicit new HBO series.

The show, ""Euphoria,"" which premiered Sunday night, features the actress as Rue, a 17-year-old recovering drug addict who returns to high school after rehab. In the first four episodes that we've seen, the show depicts all manner of explicit content: underage sex between a teenage girl and a much older man, a high-school girl who makes money showing off her body on webcam, a graphic guide to different types of penis pictures, and multiple closeups of male genitalia during a rowdy locker room scene.

Zendaya knows that the series is a departure from her ""Shake It Up"" days. Over the weekend, she embraced her career turn while also issuing a warning to young fans about the ""mature"" content in her show.

""Euphoria"" is ""a raw and honest portrait of addiction, anxiety and the difficulties of navigating life today,"" she wrote in an Instagram post. ""There are scenes that are graphic, hard to watch and can be triggering. Please only watch if you feel you can handle it.""

Fans on Instagram filled the post with supportive comments.

Halle Berry sent heart emojis. ""New Chapter,"" wrote supermodel Winnie Harlow. ""Congrats!"" wrote singer Big Sean. ""CANT WAIT !!!"" added designer Jeremy Scott.

Some viewers on Twitter still joked about how it was jarring to see Disney darling Zendaya, who also stars in the upcoming ""Spider-Man: Far From Home"" (out July 2), do drugs in ""Euphoria.""

On Sunday night, Zendaya tweeted about how grateful she was for her new show's support."

143,3,"People criticize Meghan McCain a lot — and not always without reason — for bringing up her late father all the time.

If you watch “The View,” the ABC morning talk show of which McCain is a co-host, or follow her on Twitter, you usually don’t have to wait too long before you hear her bring up Sen. John McCain. The words “my father” get mentioned a lot.

Sunday marked McCain’s first Father’s Day without hers; her dad died Aug. 25. Meghan McCain has been public in her grief and her difficulty in getting over her father’s death, so it’s no surprise that she was not looking forward to Father’s Day.

So she took to Twitter to both work her way through her own grief and help others whose fathers have died to get through the day.

She calls it the #deaddadsclub.

“Anyone else out there who is dreading Father’s Day this Sunday — I feel you, and have been trying to come up with something positive to do Sunday,” she tweeted. “So, I want you to feel free to share #deaddadsclub stories on my timeline and I will share it. Maybe we will all feel less alone?”

Evidently so. Scores of people have responded with tweets about losing their own fathers, relating intensely personal, and moving, anecdotes.

“#deaddadsclub @MeghanMcCain, this is such an awesome idea,” one person tweeted. “Lost my dad a little over two years ago, and I will say — the first Father’s Day is the hardest. It never gets easy, but the more time that passes, the easier it gets to let the good memories drown out the sad.”

Not all of the tweets are sad, however. Some are funny, and some are hopeful.

“I miss my dad every single day,” one woman tweeted, “but Father’s Day is a reminder of all of the good fathers I know so I shower them with my love and supports and encourage their children to treasure each moment. #deaddadsclub""

On Father's Day, McCain posted on Twitter a picture of her as a baby with her dad — and Sen. Barry Goldwater. The caption reads, ""I love you forever — and I am grateful for it all.""

The #deaddadsclub posts are pretty fascinating reading. In an email Thursday, McCain said, “These holidays are really difficult. I have been dreading Father’s Day. Hopefully this is some small way for people to feel less alone and have a sense of community who have lost a father.”

147,3,"As anniversaries go, Lake Havasu City’s is a hot one. Twenty-five years ago, the thermometer notched a record-breaking 128 degrees for a U.S. city. Now, it hopes to beat the June 29 record scorcher — and plans a party with cookie-baking on car dashboards and stamping visitors with “We Know We’re Hot” temporary tattoos.

The Arizona city posted the super-high temperature on June 29, 1994, the hottest day recorded in roughly a century of record-keeping in the state.

“It was a whole week’s worth of 120 to 125 degree temperatures, and then that spike up to 128,” said Doyle Wilson, an environmental scientist and adjunct professor at Arizona State University’s Havasu campus. “We actually had our highest and second-highest temperatures ever during that three- or four-day period.”

A quick getaway to the London Bridge, in Lake Havasu City »

The free Hot for Havasu festival runs from 3 to 6 p.m. June 29, with a slew of free events at the London Bridge Resort, near the city’s most iconic attraction, transported stone-by-stone from London to the Arizona desert in the early 1970s.

Cookie dough placed on car dashboards around noon should be come out of the auto “ovens” around 5:30 p.m. It’s not unusual for temperatures inside cars to reach 150 degrees in the summertime, Doyle said, meaning five hours should sufficiently bake the cookies. The fest also will feature temporary tattoos, body painting, games and live music.

At 5:15 p.m., an ice sculpture carved of the local high temperature (this year’s, not 1994’s record) will reveal whether the city made it to 129 degrees or hotter.

In the meantime, Lake Havasu City will continue to keep score with Death Valley’s big heat. The two destinations, 265 miles apart, remained competitively close temperature-wise over the last three decades. “When you average those numbers out, Death Valley is warmer by 1 degree than Lake Havasu City,” Doyle said.

And for anyone who wants to find out whether it's hot enough to fry an egg on the sidewalk, you may do so during the summer in cities along the lower Colorado River, including Bullhead City, Ariz., and Needles, Calif. Just make sure you use aluminum foil for your experiments so you don’t leave big messes behind."
149,3,"A Florida burglary suspect told police that he’s stolen a number of inflatable pool toys so he could have sex with them instead of raping women, a report said.

The suspect, 35-year-old Christopher William Monnin, allegedly broke into a number of homes in the city of Palm Bay in Brevard County that have private pools and stole the inflatables, the Miami Herald reported, citing a police report from the sheriff’s office.

The “defendant stated that he sexually gratifies himself with the pool floats instead of raping women,” an arrest report for Monnin read, according to the Herald.

There have been at least 13 burglaries reported in the area in which inflatable pool toys were stolen, according to the report. Monnin is suspected in all of the thefts, the Herald reported.

Police tracked him down on June 5 and stopped him while he was riding a bike with a garbage bag full of deflated pool toys.

Monnin brought police to a vacant house in Palm Bay where he stores the inflatables. There were about 75 of the toys in the house, according to the report.

His arraignment is set for July 16."

151,3,"You may have read ""Beloved,"" clutched ""The Bluest Eye"" to your chest or memorized ""Song of Solomon"" – but do you know the history of Nobel Prize-winning author Toni Morrison?

A new documentary, ""Toni Morrison: The Pieces I Am"" (in theaters Friday in New York and Los Angeles, expands through summer), seeks to demystify the acclaimed writer, who died Tuesday at age 88, digging into her personal history, showcasing how her work probes the interior lives of African Americans and highlighting the moments in her remarkable career that became touchstones. Here are five things you probably don't know about Morrison, from how her friendship with Oprah Winfrey started to how she worked her magic on Muhammad Ali.

1. Toni Morrison worked as an editor for years while also writing her own books

Morrison began her career as a professor at Howard University, before spotting a classified ad in The New York Review of Books in 1965 for a book editor in Syracuse. That imprint was soon acquired by Random House, sending Morrison to New York, where the single mother of two sons nurtured many influential black writers, including Toni Cade Bambara, Gayl Jones and Lucille Clifton. But at night, she worked on her own books. ""Editors are not writers. So I don't tell anybody,"" she says.

Fun fact: She convinced secretaries to type up her manuscript for 1970's ""The Bluest Eye"" by baking the ladies one of her famous carrot cakes.

2. She was castigated by early critics for not writing about white people

In a 1973 review of ""Sula,"" The New York Times criticized Morrison, saying her work was boxed in by her insistence on writing about her own community – without including confrontation with whites. “Toni Morrison is far too talented to remain only a marvelous reporter of the black side of provincial American life,"" wrote the critic.

In the documentary, Morrison addresses such claims. “I have had reviews in the past that have accused me of not writing about white people ... as though our lives have no meaning and no depth without the white gaze,"" she says plainly. ""I have spent my entire writing life trying to make sure that the white gaze was not the dominant one in any of my books.""

3. She went on a book tour with Muhammad Ali

While promoting Ali's book ""The Greatest: My Own Story,"" the two got off to a rocky start. ""When I first met him and asked him a question, he would answer and look at a man and never looked directly at me while he was giving the answer. But then I remembered he respects older women,"" Morrison recalls, saying she realized she should act more like his mother. ""So I just crossed my arms as I walked in the room and said, 'Ali, get up from there, you have something to do.' And he would look up and recognize ... a grown-up. And from then on, he did everything I said,"" she chuckles.

4. Oprah got creative trying to get her phone number

After reading ""Beloved,"" Oprah wanted to call Morrison personally, but the famous author's number was unlisted. So the TV star called the fire department and asked for it.

Morrison remembers picking up the phone. ""She said, 'Toni Morrison, this is Oprah Winfrey.' I said, 'How did you get my number?' "" she laughs. Oprah made her plea to turn ""Beloved"" into a movie, ultimately convincing a skeptical Morrison. Oprah made the 1998 film and starred as Sethe, an escaped slave who murders her own daughter rather than see her child returned to a Kentucky plantation to live as a slave.

5. Morrison called time's up on equal pay in the 1970s

""Navigating a white male world was not threatening; it wasn't even interesting,"" says Morrison candidly, recalling her first job as an editor. ""I knew more than they did and I wasn't afraid to show it. You have to be a little tough and rely on yourself, and tell people 'no.' ""

In her first job, the single mom noticed her male counterparts were getting more money when the raises were given out. ""So I went to my boss and I said, 'You didn't raise me as much as my colleagues who are men.' He said. 'Yes, but.' And I said, 'I don't want to hear 'but.' I want to tell you something: I am head of the household. Just. Like. You.""

She got the money."

153,3,"What To Know About The Sudden Talk Of War With Iran

President Trump came into office criticizing the U.S. wars in Afghanistan and Iraq and promised he would try to avoid foreign military engagements. Yet this month the White House has been talking as if conflict with Iran is suddenly on the table. Trump tweeted over the weekend, ""If Iran wants to fight, that will be the official end of Iran.""

But it's not clear if U.S. officials have evidence that Iran ""wants to fight"" or why the Pentagon has dispatched additional ships and bombers to the Middle East.

National security adviser John Bolton and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo have been especially aggressive in their Iran rhetoric.

Pompeo and other top officials briefed members of the House and Senate in private on Tuesday. Acting Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan told reporters that the U.S. warnings and deployments have already made Iran think twice about starting anything. ""This is about deterrence, not about war,"" Shanahan said.

But Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif told CNN the U.S. is ""playing a very, very dangerous game"" by placing more military assets in the region.

Wednesday night, two U.S. officials told NPR's Tom Bowman the White House is considering a further deployment of about 5,000 military personnel to the region. This would include Patriot missile batteries designed to shoot down incoming missiles, plus aircraft and warships. The officials stressed the deployment, if approved, would be ""defensive in nature.""

Here's a look at how the talk has turned so bellicose and the risks involved.

What changed between the U.S. and Iran?

The first Sunday night in May, the White House issued a statement from Bolton, saying the U.S. has seen ""a number of troubling and escalatory indications and warnings"" tied to the Iranian regime threatening U.S. and allied interests. Bolton said the U.S. was sending an aircraft carrier strike group and land-based bombers to the Persian Gulf in response.

Later, administration sources said intelligence photos showed Iran had loaded missiles onto small boats run by Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, which the U.S. last month declared a terrorist organization. But then the Iranian forces reportedly unloaded some. U.S. allies in the Gulf last week said oil tankers suffered damage from sabotage attributed to Iran. Iran has denied plans to attack U.S. interests but said it is prepared to defend itself against the United States.

Iran and the U.S. have been adversaries for decades. Why is this happening now?

The Trump administration is trying to pressure and isolate Iran.

A year ago, Trump fulfilled a campaign promise by pulling out of the Obama-era agreement to limit Iran's nuclear program. That was a deal between Iran and world powers to ease economic sanctions in return for Iran putting limits on its nuclear program. Trump says it's not tough enough. Since pulling out, the U.S. has been pushing hard for countries to stop doing business with Iran in the hopes it will change its behavior in the region, like stop supporting militias in Lebanon, Yemen and elsewhere and stop developing missiles. Pompeo says Iran needs to act ""like a normal country.""

One of the U.S. officials raising alarms about Iran threats is Bolton, who joined the administration as national security adviser a year ago and has in the past supported forcing a regime change in Iran. But administration officials insist the goal now is only to change the regime's behavior. That would include, officials say, renegotiating the nuclear deal. Iran rejects the idea of reopening the deal.

Why are other countries resisting the U.S. push?

First, the Trump administration has split from other world powers on the nuclear deal. The U.S. is the only signatory to pull out, while others — Britain, France, Germany, Russia, China, the European Union — say the agreement is working to keep Iran from getting close to building nuclear weapons. They're working to keep it going, even though companies in those countries could get cut off from business with the U.S. if they do business with Iran. China, Iran's biggest oil buyer, has tried to continue importing Iranian crude.

As the U.S. increases pressure and warns of military action, European leaders seem to be getting more worried. They fear Iran will just decide that since it's not getting the sanctions relief and economic benefits promised under the nuclear deal, it will just resume its previous nuclear activities. Iran has threatened it could do so next month if Europe doesn't save the deal.

Europeans remember misleading U.S. warnings about the threat of Iraqi weapons before the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003.

How real is the risk of war?

Both Iran and the United States are on the record denying they want a war and it's hard to see how it would be popular in either country. But the military situation in the Middle East is inherently unstable, and there are multiple potential flashpoints. U.S. and Iranian military forces are in close proximity across the region.

There's a risk of miscalculation or accident. U.S. and Iranian boats crisscross in the Persian Gulf, where Iran captured some U.S. sailors in 2016. Iranian officials have threatened to block the narrow Strait of Hormuz. Pro-Iranian militias move in the same cities in Iraq as U.S. troops and have attacked them in the past. They're also close to each other in Syria.

The U.S. has major military bases in Qatar and Bahrain, just across the Gulf from Iran.

Some of Iran's hard-liners might welcome a conflict with the U.S. because it would undermine moderate Iranians who want to engage with the West.

And a small conflict could grow. Iran could engage in underground attacks around the region or outside it. Israel or Saudi Arabia might take the opportunity to attack their big regional rival."

155,3,"Thanks largely to the obsessions of President Trump, this country’s attention has been riveted by the tens of thousands of migrants, most of them families, moving north through Mexico in hopes of reaching a future in America.

But that migration is just part of a growing regional crisis that has people on the move not only from Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador, but also from Venezuela — an all-but-failed state — and parts of Colombia, where there are fears of renewed violence from a resurgent separatist movement that has over the years displaced more than 7 million people within the country.

Each of these issues is problematic enough on its own, but taken in their totality they pose a growing and dire threat to regional stability.

The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees this week renewed a call for regional talks to confront the displacement issue before it evolves into a much larger and harder-to-handle refugee crisis.

As it is, the U.S. asylum system is overwhelmed by requests for sanctuary, with some 350,000 people apprehended at the U.S.-Mexico border from March through May, a significant jump over recent years (though not all are seeking asylum). Similarly, Mexico has endured a doubling of asylum requests.

And the UNHCR estimates 4 million Venezuelans have fled their country, with most of them settling in Colombia, Peru and Chile in search of food and work. Given the unresolved battle for power between President Nicolas Maduro and Juan Guaido, the legislative leader who has declared himself president, conditions in Venezuela aren’t likely to settle any time soon.

The UNHCR has suggested a pragmatic approach of governments working together to expand capacities for dealing with refugees in the short term and, as needed, helping them integrate into new societies or reintegrate into the ones they left.

It’s neither a new problem nor a new approach — the UNHCR helped organize a meeting of American states and international organizations a decade ago to focus on regional migration issues.

But clearly, previous efforts have been insufficient to handle the current task.

While the Trump administration seems to think the solution to the flow is to simply stop people from crossing borders, that strategy won’t work over time.

The problem requires a regional solution, including creating an multinational infrastructure for giving aid to those who desperately need it, stabilizing civic institutions in nations with long histories of political turmoil, and building capacity to help people affected not only by political upheaval but also by recurring earthquakes, powerful hurricanes and, as we’re seeing now, crop failures and food insecurity influenced by climate change.

Enter the Fray: First takes on the news of the minute »

Of course, getting the Trump administration, which is deeply suspicious of multilateral agreements and actions, to embrace such a regional approach to problem resolution isn’t likely to happen.

But the UNHCR is right to make this call, and other governments in the region should unite in addressing the growing migration problem, even if the U.S. remains on the sidelines for now."

157,3,"Gov. Andrew Cuomo on Monday batted back criticism of his push to change MTA board rules to install his out-of-town budget director on the panel — insisting the appointment is OK because his pick used to live in the city.

State law says MTA board members must reside in one of the 12 counties served by the transit system, while budget director Robert Mujica lives in Columbia County.

“The theory behind that law is that you should be familiar with the MTA,” Cuomo told reporters.

“In the case of Mr. Mujica, he’s a Staten Island boy. He lives in Albany now because he’s the budget director, but he knows the MTA intimately. He’s been working with the MTA for years. He’s in the city all the time.”

State legislators have expressed reluctance to change the rules for Mujica, which good government groups say would set a bad precedent.

The governor followed his comments by ribbing reporters on the basis of their hometowns — declining to take a follow-up question from a Post reporter who identified himself as from Washington, DC.

160,3,"Nintendo had a treat in store for gaming fans at its Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3) keynote yesterday, showcasing a range of new titles set to launch on its Switch console.

The Japanese games company has always done E3 differently to its competitors and did so once again at this year’s event - which wraps up tomorrow at the Los Angeles Convention Center. Instead of hosting a live conference, the firm released a light-hearted, pre-recorded briefing about all of the games being developed by its team.

And while there was no news on the rumoured Switch 2, the 45-minute Nintendo Direct presentation left gamers with plenty to be excited about.

Here are the best games from this year’s E3-based Nintendo Direct:

The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild 2

The biggest surprise of Nintendo Direct was the announcement of an upcoming sequel to The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild.

The open-world adventure game was “one of the biggest, best and most beloved” titles yet when it launched on the Switch back in early 2017, so the reveal of Breath of the Wild 2 “quickly took the internet by storm”, says Den of Geek.

The entertainment news site argues that the preview trailer’s “horror” tone suggests the “beautiful landscape” of Hyrule, the world explored by players in the first game, may be ripped to “shreds” by a villain similar to Breath of the Wild antagonist Calamity Ganon.

Nintendo is keeping quiet about when the new title will launch.

The Luigi’s Mansion series has been a hit with fans since debuting on the Nintendo GameCube in 2001, so it’s “reassuring” that the upcoming third instalment “does not reinvent the wheel”, says Eurogamer.

While his brother Mario is off saving Princess Peach from the clutches of Bowser once again, Luigi is left to explore a dingy hotel that has been overrun by ghosts.

However, Luigi’s Mansion 3 “refines the formula” of its predecessors and adds a range of new features - such as the controllable “Gooigi” figure that helps Luigi dodge traps - which feel as though they’ve “been there since the GameCube original”, the news site adds.

There’s no official release date yet, but the game is expected to arrive before the year is out.

The Super Mario franchise may be Nintendo’s most popular series but Banjo-Kazooie was one of the key games that defined the Japanese firm’s N64 console generation in the 1990s.

Following the success of Banjo-Kazooie and its sequel, Banjo-Tooie, developer Rare was bought by Microsoft to create games exclusively for its Xbox consoles. Sadly, the series hasn’t been extended since the release of the polarising Banjo-Kazooie: Nuts & Bolts in 2008.

Now, however, Nintendo has struck a deal with Microsoft to bring both Banjo the bear and Kazooie, a bird with attitude, into its latest fighting game, Super Smash Bros. Ultimate.

The two characters can be downloaded for the game in the autumn, with new heroes from the Dragon Quest series arriving too, says Metro.

Travis Pastrana, the colourful protagonist from Suda51’s fighting game No More Heroes, will soon be starring in another action-packed game on the Nintendo Switch.

A trailer for No More Heroes 3 shown during Nintendo Direct reveals that players will once again be put into the shoes of Pastrana as he fights hordes of enemies to become “the world’s best assassin”, says Polygon.

“No More Heroes 3 continues the weird energy of the previous games”, with the story picking up directly after the events of the second game, the site adds.

Following on from last year’s popular Let’s go, Pikachu! and Let’s go, Eevee! games, Pokemon’s first traditional role-playing game (RGP) launches on the Nintendo Switch later in 2019.

Nintendo has revealed a host of new features for Pokemon Sword and Shield, including dynamic weather and an in-game smartphone that players use to track their Pokemon, says Engadget. Players also get a rotating, third-person camera for the first time, which “will completely change the feel of exploration”.

The Pokemon Sword and Shield launch in November and will be available as two separate games. Although the core story and world of each game is identical, players will be given unique Pokemon to collect depending on which copy they choose."
161,3,Immigrants in Trump Ceremony Didn’t Know They Would Appear at RNC
162,3,"New York’s most expensive — and phoniest — apartment is history.

Listed for $85 million, the penthouse of the Atelier at 635 W. 42nd St. had commanded an impressive position on Manhattan’s residential market since 2013. But last week, The Post once again exposed the listing for what it was: an astronomically ambitious bait-and-switch scene.

Now under fresh scrutiny, the “penthouse’s” listing broker — corrupt building boss Dan Neiditch — has yanked it off the market.

As previously reported, the so-called penthouse on the 45th and 44th floors was in fact made up of roughly a dozen occupied apartments. Real estate experts familiar with the deal told The Post that the listing’s prominent place on real estate website Streeteasy was used to draw eyes to the building’s lesser units and elevate the status of the building in the eyes of potential buyers.

But that was hardly the building’s only scandal. Last week, the Wall Street Journal exposed the financial ties between Neiditch — who is also the building’s condo board president and manager — and a Spanish short-term rental company that turned the 475-unit tower into a massive Airbnb racket.

On Oct. 12, the Mayor’s Office of Special Enforcement raided the building and issued 33 violations for illegal short-term rentals.

Now that the heat is on, Neiditch has disappeared his flashiest marketing gimmick, but that doesn’t mean he’s done playing games. Unit 27K at the building is still on Streeteasy asking $50 million. The listing describes the unit as having 18 rooms and 12,500 square feet. It, however, isn’t an existing unit either; it is also made up of multiple uncombined units. It even comes with the same flights to space that were being offered with the penthouse. It too, is on the market with Neiditch’s brokerage, River 2 River Realty."
163,3,"Dear Pharmacist: I have brain fog, attention deficit and a general feeling of disconnection to the world. I take the drugs Provigil, Zoloft and Clonazepam. I also take vitamins, but nothing helps. I see a psychiatrist who says I'm just depressed from my divorce. Honestly, I'm not, I'm pretty normal, but my brain feels weird. -E.R., Anchorage, Alaska

Your neurotransmitters (brain chemicals) affect this. Many people feel ""weird"" in the head and it's really, really hard to untangle. I'm not even going to try, but I believe you! I can't figure out from here if you feel ""weird"" because of those medications, or if that's why you're taking the medicines.

As a pharmacist, many of our medications have value because they alter neurotransmitters, but it's temporary. You must know what brain chemicals are off, and the ratios before treatment. I recommend blood tests to evaluate neurotransmitter levels. I think this is where you and your doctor should start, rather than shooting medicine darts in the dark. Two excellent specialty labs are Pharmasan and Dunwoody labs. Any willing doctor can order a test from them.

You live in Alaska, so you are probably vitamin D deficient and that affects neurotransmitters. I also wonder if you're thyroid hormone has been optimized. It's easier said than done. Studies show thyroid hormone, specifically T3, improves mood better than prescription antidepressants. T3 medications are not the same as T4 drugs (Synthroid or Levoxyl). Here's how ""weird"" neurotransmitter imbalances can make you feel:

Dopamine: Deficiencies make you crave alcohol, illicit drugs, opiate painkillers and cigarettes. Yes, correcting dopamine levels can help addiction. But too much dopamine is associated with aggression and paranoia. Imbalances with this neurotransmitter (especially when low) are tied to Parkinson's, depression, attention/focus problems, schizophrenia, spectrum disorders and autism.

Histamine: It makes you sneeze, but did you know that chronically high levels are tied to migraines and eczema, and obsessive compulsive behavior? Low levels cause fatigue, low libido and paranoia.

Serotonin: Popular antidepressants lift it temporarily including the Zoloft you take. Deficiencies can cause fatigue, muscle cramps, irritability and always feeling hot. High serotonin is tied to bone loss, irritable bowels, trembling, nausea, and a feeling of overconfidence that some might call arrogance.

If you're lacking norepinephrine you'll have profound adrenal fatigue and stubborn weight gain. You'll want energy shots all day long. If you're GABA-deficient (gamma-aminobutyric acid), insomnia and anxiety are evident to those around you. High epinephrine and you're too aggressive. Despite commercial ads, there isn't a cure-all pill. You'll have to do different tests, and then take specific nutrients that push the correct metabolic pathway to produce the neurotransmitter or hormone you need."
164,3,"WASHINGTON – Rep. Chip Roy may not have made many new friends in the House this week after he kept his fellow lawmakers up all night debating a $1 trillion spending bill.

All through Wednesday evening and into Thursday, weary-eyed members of Congress slogged through amendment after amendment after Roy used a procedural tactic that dramatically lengthened the time it took to vote. Evening plans were canceled, members became grumpy and Roy himself got just two hours of sleep and missed his 15-year wedding anniversary.

By the time they ended, roughly 4 a.m. in Washington, D.C., the sun was close to casting its first light on the Washington Monument.

But if you ask Roy, a Texas Republican, he'd do it all again. His marathon act of protest was to draw attention to funding dedicated to managing and combating the surge of migrants at the southern border, and force Democrats to act on President Donald Trump’s $4.5 billion funding request for the Department of Homeland Security.

'We're off and running': A look at Donald Trump's un-Trumpian campaign for reelection in 2020

Democrats had planned to go through dozens of amendments to the spending package, which included funding for a variety of programs, including health care, by a voice vote, meaning lawmakers would just call out ""aye"" or ""no"" and exact votes wouldn't be recorded. Roy chose the long way. He repeatedly asked for a roll call vote, meaning each member's name was called to vote and a clerk recorded each one on a sheet, which drew out the process significantly.

The freshman lawmaker, who is a member of the ultra-conservative House Freedom Caucus, pitched the plan to fellow Republicans, arguing that House Democrats were ignoring the crisis at the border, which has become a core focus of Trump's. So often, he said, issues are rushed through without an actual full vote that includes debate.

Who will replace Sarah Sanders?: Her departure means a new voice for the White House. Only Trump knows who it will be.

Roy, 46, told USA TODAY that Republicans, constituents and members of the White House praised him for the overnight voting session. Unsurprisingly, there were some who weren't thrilled with being stuck voting for hours into the night.

""Wow! Who is the a**hole making me stay here and vote for all these hours,"" one lawmaker remarked, according to Roy. Another chimed in that they'd been forced to cancel a dinner because of the stunt.

The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, the campaign arm for House Democratic candidates, accused him of ""grandstanding.""

""Congressman Roy is embarrassing himself and his community once again by grandstanding and delaying funding for our armed services and other vital national priorities,"" read a statement from the DCCC. ""It’s clear Congressman Roy is more concerned with partisan showboating and causing gridlock than actually doing his job — and that makes him the ultimate swamp creature.""

Rather than balking, Roy leaned into the criticism.

""The interesting part is listening to the complaints on the floor. I was really entertained,"" he said. ""It's like, 'Cry me a river. Go down and walk and talk to the migrant who's being abused, look that migrant in the eye and tell me that they should care about you missing your dinner.'""

Air Force One's new paint job: Trump defends new Air Force One new colors 'The baby blue doesn't fit with us'

The tactic has become Roy's weapon of choice.

Last month, he was able to single-handedly delay $19.1 billion in disaster relief because most House members had left town and gone back to their districts before the Senate passed the bill. House Democratic leaders tried to push the measure through using a procedure known as ""unanimous consent,"" which allows passage if no one objects.

Roy was there to object, arguing that the legislation did not do enough to help secure the southern U.S. border. He said he wanted lawmakers to be present to vote. The bill passed when Congress returned from recess and Trump signed the bill earlier this month.

Like that attempt, his most recent act of defiance would eventually end. The House adjourned early Thursday morning after getting through votes on dozens of amendments.

While Roy drew the side-eye from his colleagues, his wife, Carrah, was home in Austin, Texas. As an anniversary gift, he'd taken their two young children to Washington and gave her a full week of relaxation. While they might not have had the chance to spend the day together as he would have liked, Roy said, he wasn't planning that their anniversary would be celebrated via text message and Twitter.

""I planned on certainly talking with her and frankly, I mean, I was planning on getting off and sending her some flowers, but I just got sucked into this thing on the floor and just couldn't get away, so I'm texting her from the floor saying, 'Happy anniversary, honey!'"" and promising that he would make it up to her when he gets back.

Roy said it's likely not the last time he'll make headlines or be called a ""grandstander"" for his acts of protest.

""I have no specific plans but I have an absolute commitment to making sure this town doesn't just operate on autopilot, that we vote, that we debate, that we highlight issues of the day,"" he said.

As for Carrah, she's grown used to his late nights.

""I couldn't do it without her,"" he said. ""In 15 years, she's put up with a lot."""
165,3,"California may be on the verge of eliminating single-family zoning statewide. This is huge. And it’s a sign of how quickly the politics around housing and land use have shifted in just the last year.

On Wednesday, a key committee signed off on Senate Bill 50 — San Francisco Sen. Scott Wiener’s bill to allow denser, taller housing around transit and in communities with lots of jobs. As part of the negotiations, Wiener agreed to merge his proposal with Senate Bill 4 by Sen. Mike McGuire (D-Healdsburg) and the result includes one very big change: Single-family houses could be converted to four-unit buildings, by right, anywhere in the state.

That is, a property owner could subdivide or remodel a house to turn it into four apartments. Or a developer could build a fourplex on a vacant single-family lot. The proposal wouldn’t allow people to demolish a house and build a new fourplex on the property, however.

It’s unclear how many property owners could reasonably convert a house to apartments, or whether this proposal would significantly increase multi-family housing in what are now single-family neighborhoods. There are also serious questions about whether this proposal will survive future committee hearings, not to mention the Assembly gantlet and Gov. Gavin Newsom’s veto pen.

Still — let’s just pause on the fact that a bipartisan group of lawmakers voted in favor of a bill that would allow apartments pretty much anywhere in California.

Again, this would be a major change from the status quo. Wiener has said that it’s illegal to build more than a single-family house (plus an in-law unit) in roughly 80% of California’s residential neighborhoods.

And yet, maybe the support for this proposal is not so surprising. The political winds have been shifting on single-family restrictions. Last year, the Minneapolis City Council voted to eliminate single-family zoning and instead allow duplexes and triplexes to be built on lots reserved for one house. The city enacted the policy so it would be easier to build affordable, denser communities, but also to help integrate neighborhoods that are still segregated as a result of discriminatory housing practices dating back decades. Strict single-family zoning was often adopted as a way to segregate neighborhoods without explicitly banning any racial or religious group.

Planners in Charlotte, N.C., are looking to eliminate single-family zoning for the same reasons.

On the West Coast, the high-cost cities of Seattle and Portland have considered rezoning single-family lots or allowing up to four-unit buildings in single-family neighborhoods. One Oregon lawmaker proposed allowing fourplexes on single-family lots in any city in the state with more than 10,000 residents.

Even Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti — who was down on Wiener’s proposal last year to open single-family neighborhoods to denser development — is warming to the idea. He told Times reporter Liam Dillon earlier this month that the city was looking at the Minneapolis model of allowing triplexes on single-family lots as a way to build more housing “that is also neighborhood compatible.”

It’s also worth noting that the fourplex proposal originated with Sen. McGuire, who represents suburban communities in Northern California. The idea was to let communities grow denser in an organic way that maintained community character by, for example, allowing an old Victorian house to be converted into four apartments.

“No community should see dramatic change, but every community should see some change,” McGuire said Wednesday before the vote to blend his bill into SB 50.

That’s a comforting mantra to suburban communities and single-family neighborhoods. But let’s be clear — allowing apartments in single-family neighborhoods would be a dramatic and important change.

167,3,"The Democratic Party is struggling mightily to figure out how to confront President Trump's staggering corruption. More and more of its members of Congress are getting behind the idea of an impeachment inquiry, but the party leadership is (somewhat mysteriously) trying desperately to avoid the issue. Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi has deployed one excuse after the next, most recently the absolutely preposterous theory that Trump is plotting to get himself impeached as part of a Snidely Whiplash-esque scheme. Meanwhile, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, who has less power but greater freedom, is all but absent from the entire discussion.

Here's a suggestion: Democrats need to remember how playground bullying works. Trump is an enormous crook, yes, but he is also an overgrown petulant child. To fight him, Democrats should imagine him as a spoiled, lazy, entitled, none-too-bright 9-year-old who likes to kick puppies and kittens.

The first rule of bullies is that they are drawn to perceived weakness. No bully wants to try to pick on someone bigger and stronger than they are — they want to terrorize weak and helpless people who won't fight back. The point is the psychological satisfaction of easy domination, not brawling for its own sake. Indeed, most bullies are not actually very good at fighting, and will fold immediately if faced with a real physical confrontation.

This fits Trump's record to a T. He talks big, but runs from a fight. He boasts about his physical prowess, but he's an overweight, dainty slob who cheats at golf and can barely walk down stairs. He's routinely ripped off small and helpless suppliers in his real estate projects, but quickly folded when presented with a powerful adversary, like a big bank or the mafia. The Mueller report details that when the investigation was announced, Trump whined, ""Oh my god. This is terrible. This is the end of my presidency. I'm f--ked.""

But when it turned out Democrats were too scared of their own shadow to actually pursue the impeachment inquiry that Mueller teed up for them (in addition to Trump's unprecedented and wildly unconstitutional profiteering off the presidency), Trump's bully instincts surged right back. He sensed, correctly, that he could continue to push around Democrats — and so instructed his subordinates to disobey congressional subpoenas, told his treasury secretary to keep his tax returns secret, and submitted lawsuits arguing Congress has no right to investigate anything he does.

The lesson here is that timidity and handwringing only encourages Trump. If they don't confront him with tactics just as aggressive as the ones he uses, he will conclude they are cowards who can be cowed easily. Now, attacking on all fronts might not stop Trump from trying to break the law — even a fearful bully can fight when cornered — but it's a bare minimum requirement at least.

The second rule of bullies is that they are insecure. They often harm others to soothe their sense of inadequacy, like the potential police officer ""whose paranoia and inferiority complex constantly haunt him, leading him to lash out at others in order to convince them he is in control."" Trump is one of the most spoiled people who has ever lived — a man whose every whim was indulged by his real estate tycoon father, who gave Trump hundreds of millions of dollars tax-free and constantly bailed out his failed real estate projects. When the wolves were finally at the door in the early 2000s, Trump was rescued once again by NBC to create The Apprentice. This divergence between self-image and constant failure no doubt breeds an ocean of insecurity.

As Deadspin's David J. Roth writes, Trump's ""one deeply held belief that has been evident throughout his whole faithless disgrace of a life is people should be talking about Donald Trump more, on television, and he has just about seen that part through."" He's so narcissistic and needy it would be pathetic, if it weren't for the gruesome consequences of his holding power.

Trump is not some evil genius masterminding the overthrow of American democracy. As Albert Burneko writes, ""he is a soft, breathless, foam-boned inheritance baby with a brain like a wet saltine cracker, because he has been crippled and made monstrous by money and endless permission and therefore cannot conceive of there being any truth or morality beyond what he wants right now[.]"" He did not plan to win the presidency, and still has no idea what to do with it or even how it works.

But on the other hand, insecure bullies are pretty easy to bait into foot-stamping tantrums — especially if you drill into their sources of self-worth, which in Trump's case would be his business record. Impeachment hearings would of necessity have to focus on his financial records, which would no doubt find a lot of appalling mismanagement and fraud.

At any rate, I'd guess there is almost no chance that the Democratic leadership will listen to any of this. They give every indication of actually being the cowards Trump thinks they are. They are enormously privileged themselves, and such people are often bewildered by outright personal confrontation (as opposed to traditional rich people passive-aggression or gossiping behind people's backs). And that's when they aren't taking the opportunity to sneak through legislation their big donor supporters want, like a bizarre bill from Pelosi that would allow Trump to claim he is cutting drug prices but achieve little.

If Democrats actually want to protect American democracy from Trump, they're going to have to remember how to throw a punch."
168,3,"New York State children are much more likely to have health insurance and less likely to die young than kids in other states, but high housing costs are impacting their economic well-being, according to a national study released Monday.

The 30th annual “Kids Count” report from the Baltimore-based Annie E. Casey Foundation also found that preschool is more common for 3- and 4-year-old New Yorkers than children elsewhere, and that teenage pregnancy is less prevalent.

The study by the nonprofit, which focuses on improving the lives of disadvantaged children and their families, uses federal government data to compare states in 16 categories and rank them in four broad measurements of well-being, such as health and education.

New York ranks fifth nationwide in children’s health, largely because only 3 percent of the state’s children lack public or private health insurance, compared with 5 percent nationwide, and because of a child and teenager death rate of 18 per 100,000, compared with 26 per 100,000 nationally.

Comparisons from the Annie E. Casey Foundation for the nation and the state. Teens not in school and not working * Time periods for this measure were 2015-16 and 2016-17. The low uninsured rate is largely because of broad state child health benefits that include some coverage for children living in the country illegally, said Noah Berger, the foundation’s director of policy, reform and advocacy. The 2010 Affordable Care Act expanded health insurance coverage nationwide, but states like New York that used federal funding in the law to expand its Medicaid program saw a greater reduction in the uninsured, said Suzanne Brundage, director of the children’s health initiative at United Hospital Fund, a Manhattan-based nonprofit that works to improve health care for New Yorkers. Get the latest on the fast-moving developments on the coronavirus and its impact on Long Island. As a public service, this article is available for all. Newsday readers support our strong local journalism by subscribing. Please show you value this important work by becoming a subscriber now. SUBSCRIBE Even before the ACA was enacted, the state “invested in navigators, trusted community organizations that help people know they’re eligible for insurance and connect them to affordable high-quality insurance,” Brundage said. In the long run, greater access to preventive care not only leads to healthier kids, said David Nemiroff, president and CEO of Long Island FQHC Inc., a nonprofit that oversees 10 health centers in Nassau County that serve many low-income residents. It also saves money, because it prevents expensive emergency-room visits and hospitalizations, he said. The state’s worst score was in economic well-being, in which New York ranked 42nd. Twenty percent of the state’s children live in poverty, compared with 18 percent nationwide. The biggest gap between New York and the nation was in “children living in households with a high housing cost burden” — 40 percent of New York children compared with 31 percent nationwide. When families spend an especially high percentage of income on housing, that means they have less to spend on food, clothing and other necessities, Berger said. Oftentimes, that also means they can’t afford licensed child care, which typically costs about $13,000 to $14,000 a year for 3-year-olds, said Jennifer Rojas, executive director of the Child Care Council of Suffolk. “What most people do is they use unregulated care, so that means the lady down the block or a neighbor or a relative, or they cobble together a bunch of things,” she said. “While some of that may work and some of that may be very reliable and good, we always worry because it’s not regulated at all. So we don’t know the quality.” The state ranked 17th in education, with the high score driven largely by how 42 percent of New York kids ages 3 and 4 are not in school, compared with 52 percent nationwide. In New York City and Rochester, all 4-year-olds are eligible for all-day prekindergarten, said Jasmine Gripper, legislative director for the Albany-based Alliance for Quality Education, an advocacy group. In addition, the state has for years provided funding for school districts statewide for half-day pre-K programs, she said. Preschool is vital because “what all of the research shows is early intervention is the best and cheapest way to close the achievement gap,” she said."

172,3,"ROCKVILLE, Md. — A wealthy stock trader has been sentenced to nine years for his conviction in the fiery death of a man who was helping him secretly dig tunnels for a nuclear bunker beneath a Maryland home.

Daniel Beckwitt, 28, had faced a maximum of 30 years in prison when Montgomery County Circuit Court Judge Margaret Schweitzer sentenced him. In total, Beckwitt was sentenced to 21 years but the judge suspended all but nine years of the sentence.

In April, a jury convicted Beckwitt of second-degree murder and involuntary manslaughter in the September 2017 death of 21-year-old Askia Khafra.

During the trial, Montgomery County prosecutor Marybeth Ayres accused Beckwitt of recklessly endangering Khafra’s life. Beckwitt ignored obvious signs of danger and sacrificed safety for secrecy while they dug a network of tunnels beneath a home in Bethesda, a suburb of Washington, D.C., the prosecutor said.

Defense attorney Robert Bonsib had told jurors the fire was an accident, not a crime.

Firefighters found Khafra’s naked, charred body in the basement of Beckwitt’s trash-filled house, only a few steps from an exit. Prosecutors said the extreme hoarding conditions in the home prevented Khafra from escaping.

Hours before the fire broke out in the basement, Khafra texted Beckwitt to warn him it smelled like smoke in the tunnels. Ayres said Beckwitt didn’t respond for more than six hours before telling Khafra that there had been a “major electrical failure.” Instead of getting Khafra out of the tunnels, Beckwitt told him that he “just switched it all over to another circuit,” according to the prosecutor.

Bonsib said Beckwitt screamed for help from neighbors after the fire broke out and tried to rescue his friend from the blaze before heavy smoke and flames forced him to retreat.

Beckwitt did not testify at his trial, which lasted nearly two weeks. He has been in custody since the jury’s verdict.

Khafra met Beckwitt online. Beckwitt had invested money in a company Khafra was trying to launch as he helped Beckwitt dig the tunnels.

Beckwitt went to elaborate lengths to keep the project a secret. He tried to trick Khafra into thinking they were digging the tunnels in Virginia instead of Maryland by having him don “blackout glasses” before taking him on a long drive. Khafra had a cellphone with him in the tunnels, but Beckwitt used internet “spoofing” to make it appear they were digging in Virginia.

Khafra worked in the tunnels for days at a time, eating and sleeping in there and urinating and defecating into a bucket Beckwitt lowered down to him. The tunnels had lights, an air circulation system and a heater.

A hole in the concrete basement floor led to a shaft that dropped down 20 feet (6 meters) into tunnels that branched out roughly 200 feet (60 meters) in length. Investigators concluded the blaze was ignited by a defective electrical outlet in the basement.

A prosecutor has described Beckwitt as a skilled computer hacker who had a paranoid fixation on a possible nuclear attack by North Korea. In 2016, Beckwitt spoke at a hacker convention using the alias “3AlarmLampscooter” and wearing a fire-resistant suit and visor that obscured his face. Bonsib has said Beckwitt’s use of a pseudonym and disguise was harmless, typical of the “weird things” people do on the internet.

Khafra’s parents filed a wrongful death lawsuit against Beckwitt on the anniversary of the Sept. 10, 2017, fire. His father, Dia Khafra, said during an interview last year that he and his wife tried to persuade their son to stay away from Beckwitt’s tunnels."

174,3,"Google's issues with YouTube will never be totally solved.

Or at least, that's impression Google CEO Sundar Pichai suggested in a CNN interview.

Google-owned YouTube has been struggling with all sorts of content that YouTubers have flagged, including fake and conspiracy videos and lewd comments on children's videos.

YouTube has responded with more human monitors, new policies and an aggressive machine learning push to rid some of this content from YouTube.

“We’ve gotten much better at using a combination of machines and humans,” Pichai told CNN's Poppy Harlow. “So it’s one of those things, let’s say we’re getting it right 99% of the time, you’ll still be able to find examples. Our goal is to take that to a very, very small percentage well below 1%.”

Pichai said Google probably can’t get that to 100%.

YouTube receives 400 hours of new content uploaded every minute, which makes true monitoring of the content impossible. The Google CEO compared it to credit card systems. ""There’s some fraud in that....Anything when you run at that scale, you have to think about percentages.”

However, he said Google will make ""significant progress” on this and that “enforcement will get better.”"
175,3,"Sorry, we couldn't find that page."
176,3,"It was the biggest weekend for gay rights in Iowa, and Democratic candidates for president were snapping pictures downtown with potential caucusgoers, dressed in rainbow apparel for the Capital City Pride event.

Pete Buttigieg, who would become the first openly gay president if elected, was at a house party just a few miles away, talking about public education.

Buttigieg joined the Pride festivities for a speech marking the 10-year anniversary of the Iowa Supreme Court ruling that recognized same-sex marriage, but he left quickly to drive north to a rural part of the state. Buttigieg's next speech would focus on issues like veterans' rights and faith.

It’s not that Buttigieg isn't highlighting the historic significance of his run — the South Bend, Indiana, mayor repeatedly talks about his sexual orientation on the campaign trail, and he often tells audiences he’s best known as “the husband of Chasten.”

But Buttigieg is also trying to move beyond that single defining characteristic with voters.

""I am proud of who I am,"" Buttigieg told the Des Moines Register. ""I’m certainly very proud of my marriage and my husband. We don’t shy away from that. It’s also not the only thing that defines me.""

“I think some people have an image of what a gay person or an LGBTQ activist is supposed to look like. And I think if you’ve met one gay person, you’ve met one gay person,” he said. “We have different styles and different approaches. But what I try to do is just be who I am … I don’t know who else to be.""

Who he is, according to a new Des Moines Register/Mediacom/CNN Iowa Poll, is near the top of a crowded Democratic presidential field. The poll, conducted in early June, shows that, while former Vice President Joe Biden leads the pack of more than 20 candidates, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren and Buttigieg are in close competition for second place. The poll had a 4% margin of error for those questions.

Interactive guide: Who is running for president in 2020?

The first debates: Biden vs. Sanders and other things to watch

Troy Price, chairman of the Iowa Democratic Party, said it’s a sign of the times.

“No one is acting like this is the defining thing about Pete Buttigieg,” said Price, who is also gay and will not endorse during the primary. “… It’s great that we have come so far in this society that it’s actually unremarkable that a gay man can run for president.”

The Iowa Poll in June found that 62% of likely Democratic caucusgoers believe that if the Democratic candidate were gay it would make no difference in facing Republican President Donald Trump. In the poll, just 28% said being gay would be a disadvantage.

The poll, taken June 2 through 5, had a margin of error of plus or minus 4.7 percentage points for those questions. It was conducted by Selzer & Co.

Not being 'the gay candidate'

The 37-year-old Buttigieg went to Howard County after the Pride festivities because it has the unique distinction of being the only county in America to vote by more than 20 percentage points for President Barack Obama in 2012 before doing the same for Trump in 2016.

The campaign schedule, which included a stop in Mason City to talk about the state’s skilled workforce shortage, reflects a candidate who doesn’t want to be known as the “gay candidate,” said Matt McCoy, a former state senator who was the first openly gay Iowa lawmaker more than 15 years ago. McCoy hasn't endorsed a candidate yet but said he is leaning toward Buttigieg.

""One of the traps in coming out publicly is to be 'the gay state senator' or 'the gay candidate.' And not only do people innocently put you in boxes, but your opponents also want to put you in boxes,"" McCoy said. ""I just don’t think Pete wants to be put in a box.""

Fred Karger knows that better than most. During the 2012 election cycle, the 69-year-old California consultant made history as an openly gay Republican presidential candidate.

Karger said he was often asked about his sexuality on the campaign trail because of the novelty of his candidacy. He remembers reading headlines that often began with descriptions of him as a gay candidate. Karger appeared on several states' caucus or primary ballots, including Iowa's, but was not included in any of the pre-primary debates.

“Like Pete, that didn’t define me — it was a part of me,” said Karger, who has endorsed Buttigieg.

Members of the LGBTQ community this year don’t want to be boxed in on who they might support. Cindy Pollard and Gayla Snook, a married lesbian couple from Newton, renewed their vows in a public ceremony during the 2019 Pride festivities.

Pollard and Snook like Buttigieg, but they’re also impressed with Warren and California Sen. Kamala Harris.

“There’s a lot of great people, but they’ve got to resonate within,” Snook said. “Being a gay man isn’t the only thing.”

In homes, town halls and rallies around Iowa over several months, Buttigieg nearly always shares the story of how he came out in a 2015 newspaper op-ed when he was 33 years old.

Buttigieg said his deployment to Afghanistan in 2014 as a lieutenant in the Navy Reserve played a big part. The deployment prompted him to write a letter to his parents that they could find if he was killed in action. That convinced Buttigieg he wanted to live a life that included falling in love.

The story often elicits applause that he went on to win reelection as mayor that year, and includes Buttigieg meeting his husband through a dating app. They married one year ago in June, during Pride week in South Bend.

Buttigieg has begun using poignant words to describe some of the anguish surrounding his decision to come out.

“There was a time in my life when I would have cut the gay out of me if I knew how,” Buttigieg told a crowd at a scholarship awards ceremony June 7 in Des Moines honoring Matthew Shepard, a Wyoming college student who authorities say was killed for being gay in 1998.

At the dinner in Iowa, Buttigieg added: “And yet, now I know this fact about me: This unexpected, complicated gift — that was not my idea, but my Creator's — is helping me do some good in the world.”

That good was reflected on the face of Louis Peckys, a gay 18-year-old scholarship recipient from Illinois who watched Buttigieg’s speech.

“He was really cool,” Peckys said. “The fact that he came out and still managed to get reelected shows a brighter future for people who are LGBTQ running for office.”

Cara Leadingham, Peckys’ mother, put it another way: “As a parent, it gives you hope that your kid’s going to be accepted and can find success, even in small-town USA.”

Buttigieg said if he’s somehow shifted his approach in talking about being gay, it’s not conscious. An inclusion theme has crystallized in his speeches when Buttigieg criticizes Trump’s policies and their impact on marginalized people.

Buttigieg mentions equity issues for the LGBTQ community in the same breath that he highlights protecting women’s reproductive rights, countering racism and addressing immigration.

""My idea of what a healthy identity politics looks like is for each identity to connect with every other one — for all of us to find ways to relate to each other, based on our own experience. And so, at a moment when, for very different reasons, Americans of color, women, LGTBQ Americans and others feel like they’re under attack, all the more reason for us to find ways to stand up for each other,"" he said.

Karger said he believes America is ready to elect a gay president.

“They're more interested in the issues and the ideas … there’s so many more factors that will weigh in to the general election when Pete’s the nominee than being gay,"" Karger said. ""And yes, it's going to cost him votes. But yes, it'll also gain him votes.”"
177,3,"Following the fatal shooting of two Kenosha protesters, allegedly at the hands of an Illinois teen who ""idolized"" police and attended one of President Trump's rallies, The Washington Post's Philip Bump argued there is an ""inescapable echo"" between Trump's rhetoric and the armed ""vigilantes"" who came to Kenosha to ""defend"" the city against anti-racism demonstrators.

Something spurred shooting suspect Kyle Rittenhouse to drive to Kenosha with a rifle, writes Bump. And while ""it's facile to assume that we can identify that spur as the rhetoric offered"" by Trump and his re-election campaign, ""it's impossible not to notice how that rhetoric echoes in what appears to have happened in Kenosha.""

Bump also highlighted speakers at the Republican National Convention, like Donald Trump Jr. and Rep Jim Jordan (R-Ohio), who ""decried uncontrolled violent mobs."" While the rhetoric is intended to boost Trump's re-election, says Bump, ""It's obvious how it could be seen to point somewhere darker.""

""Is it unreasonable to think that this rhetoric reached Kyle Rittenhouse?"" asks Bump. The White House would say so. Counselor Kellyanne Conway told Fox News on Thursday the administration has essentially washed its hands of any responsibility for things that go down outside of Republican strongholds. Asked about violence in U.S. cities, Conway said ""these are Democratically-led cities and most with Democratic governors ... It's not Donald Trump's watch."" The New York Times Jamelle Bouie noted it's not the first time the Trump administration has said ""they do not believe they are responsible for the lives or livelihoods of anyone who didn't vote for them.""

So while many analysts are pointing to Trump's messaging as fanning the sometimes-literal flames of unrest, the White House is taking a break from its assertions of Trump's ""total authority"" across the country. Read more at The Washington Post. Summer Meza"
178,3,"Nintendo had a treat in store for gaming fans at its Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3) keynote yesterday, showcasing a range of new titles set to launch on its Switch console.

The Japanese games company has always done E3 differently to its competitors and did so once again at this year’s event - which wraps up tomorrow at the Los Angeles Convention Center. Instead of hosting a live conference, the firm released a light-hearted, pre-recorded briefing about all of the games being developed by its team.

And while there was no news on the rumoured Switch 2, the 45-minute Nintendo Direct presentation left gamers with plenty to be excited about.

Here are the best games from this year’s E3-based Nintendo Direct:

The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild 2

The biggest surprise of Nintendo Direct was the announcement of an upcoming sequel to The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild.

The open-world adventure game was “one of the biggest, best and most beloved” titles yet when it launched on the Switch back in early 2017, so the reveal of Breath of the Wild 2 “quickly took the internet by storm”, says Den of Geek.

The entertainment news site argues that the preview trailer’s “horror” tone suggests the “beautiful landscape” of Hyrule, the world explored by players in the first game, may be ripped to “shreds” by a villain similar to Breath of the Wild antagonist Calamity Ganon.

Nintendo is keeping quiet about when the new title will launch.

The Luigi’s Mansion series has been a hit with fans since debuting on the Nintendo GameCube in 2001, so it’s “reassuring” that the upcoming third instalment “does not reinvent the wheel”, says Eurogamer.

While his brother Mario is off saving Princess Peach from the clutches of Bowser once again, Luigi is left to explore a dingy hotel that has been overrun by ghosts.

However, Luigi’s Mansion 3 “refines the formula” of its predecessors and adds a range of new features - such as the controllable “Gooigi” figure that helps Luigi dodge traps - which feel as though they’ve “been there since the GameCube original”, the news site adds.

There’s no official release date yet, but the game is expected to arrive before the year is out.

The Super Mario franchise may be Nintendo’s most popular series but Banjo-Kazooie was one of the key games that defined the Japanese firm’s N64 console generation in the 1990s.

Following the success of Banjo-Kazooie and its sequel, Banjo-Tooie, developer Rare was bought by Microsoft to create games exclusively for its Xbox consoles. Sadly, the series hasn’t been extended since the release of the polarising Banjo-Kazooie: Nuts & Bolts in 2008.

Now, however, Nintendo has struck a deal with Microsoft to bring both Banjo the bear and Kazooie, a bird with attitude, into its latest fighting game, Super Smash Bros. Ultimate.

The two characters can be downloaded for the game in the autumn, with new heroes from the Dragon Quest series arriving too, says Metro.

Travis Pastrana, the colourful protagonist from Suda51’s fighting game No More Heroes, will soon be starring in another action-packed game on the Nintendo Switch.

A trailer for No More Heroes 3 shown during Nintendo Direct reveals that players will once again be put into the shoes of Pastrana as he fights hordes of enemies to become “the world’s best assassin”, says Polygon.

“No More Heroes 3 continues the weird energy of the previous games”, with the story picking up directly after the events of the second game, the site adds.

Following on from last year’s popular Let’s go, Pikachu! and Let’s go, Eevee! games, Pokemon’s first traditional role-playing game (RGP) launches on the Nintendo Switch later in 2019.

Nintendo has revealed a host of new features for Pokemon Sword and Shield, including dynamic weather and an in-game smartphone that players use to track their Pokemon, says Engadget. Players also get a rotating, third-person camera for the first time, which “will completely change the feel of exploration”.

The Pokemon Sword and Shield launch in November and will be available as two separate games. Although the core story and world of each game is identical, players will be given unique Pokemon to collect depending on which copy they choose."
179,3,"Most TV viewers take for granted the ability to change the channel from their couches with a remote control. That task may be near impossible for viewers with the most severe physical challenges.

On Monday, Comcast launches a free web-based remote on tablets and computers that lets Xfinity X1 customers with spinal cord injuries, ALS (Lou Gehrig’s disease) or other disabilities change channels on the TV, set recordings, launch the program guide and search for a show with their eyes.

The free X1 eye control works with whatever eye gaze hardware and software system the customer is using, as well as “sip-and-puff"" switches and other assistive technologies.

Comcast customers pair the web-based remote with their set-top box, after which the person can gaze at a button to send a corresponding command to the television. Users might visit an accessibility menu with their eyes to summon voice guidance, video descriptions and closed captioning.

Customers can also “type out” voice commands with their eyes to request, for example, “action movies” or a specific TV channel.

A promotional video features Jimmy Curran, 30, of Philadelphia, a research analyst and author who has spinal muscular atrophy, which is a condition that affects the part of the nervous system that controls muscle movement. He says eye-tracking means “I don’t need to depend on others to use the remote, and that is a liberating feeling. Technology is enabling me to be more independent.”"
180,3,"If time is of the essence when you travel, book with Hawaiian Airlines.

The airline ranks as the speediest airline, according to a new report from Forbes.

Forbes partnered with Aerospace Engineering and Research Associates (AERA) to study airport performance metrics and to gauge America's fastest airlines. Since 1987, on-time rates have been compiled by the Department of Transportation, where they allow airlines to determine flight times at their discretion. According to Forbes, these numbers have flaws: If a flight lands within 15 minutes of its scheduled arrival time, DOT counts it as on time.

AERA and Forbes came up with a new metric that's based on the ""block time,"" which is the time from when a plane’s brakes are released on departure through when the brakes are set at the arrival gate and the door opens. AERA reviewed all scheduled flights in the U.S. in 2018 to calculate the shortest flight time on each route.Forbes used the following example to illustrate the methodology: ""For example, the minimum block time for the LaGuardia to Miami route was pegged at 164 minutes. Airlines’ actual flight times varied from an average of 172 minutes (Frontier) to 192 minutes (American).""

AERA used this data to calculate an efficiency index average that analyzed how close an airline's flights for the year got to their routes’ minimum block times.

Among the ten mainline carriers, Hawaiian Airlines came out on top, which ranked first for efficiency as well as the DOT's on-time rate. Forbes stated that this ranking could be a result of most of Hawaiian's domestic flights being short distances between the calm-weathered Hawaiian islands.

Southwest was number two on the list. The airlines' 2018 domestic flights averaged 12.5 minutes above the minimum achievable times on each route it flew. Southwest is the country's largest domestic carrier with 1.3 million flights last year.

""Southwest flies three to four more flights a day on a given route than many of its competitors, and that requires tighter operations,"" Sam Ford, Southwest’s managing director for operations, told Forbes. “Consistent execution on the block is really important for us,” he says. “That’s table stakes for us.”

Alaska Airlines came out last in efficiency but landed third by the DOT’s on-time rate, according to Forbes. Alaska's average flight in 2018 was 20.7 minutes above the minimum block time.

However, next time you are feeling disgruntled at flight delays, it might not be the airline's fault. ""A big contributor to those flight delays is the failure to effectively manage the flow of planes arriving at airports,"" says Lonnie Bowlin, president of Dunkirk, Maryland-based AERA told Forbes.

""A flight that’s 15 minutes early with no gate open for it to go to can be just as disruptive as one that arrives five minutes past the scheduled time.""

Michael Collins, who was the Command Module pilot during the historic flight, shared what he says is a previously unreleased photo of the three astronauts in the crew.

""The crew. Found this at the bottom of a box. Don’t think it was ever used by @NASA. #TBT @TheRealBuzz,"" Collins tweeted Thursday with the ""Throwback Thursday"" hashtag.

The photo shows Collins standing against a moon replica. Astronauts Buzz Aldrin and Neil Armstrong are photographed on the other side of the moon, with Armstrong's hand on Aldrin's shoulder.

Collins had also signed the photo at some point.

USA TODAY has reached out to NASA for comment on the photo.

The Orlando Sentinel, which is releasing a 50th anniversary commemorative book on the Apollo 11 mission full of photos from 1969, reported that its staff members didn't recall ever seeing the photo after going through NASA's and its archives for the book.

Collins, now 88, was part of the three-man Apollo 11 crew, which made the first manned lunar landing in July 1969. While Armstrong and Aldrin landed and walked on the moon's surface, Collins stayed in lunar orbit.

Collins was also part of the Gemini 10 mission, which was his first spaceflight and spacewalk.

183,3,"Over the course of two days, ABC News' chief anchor George Stephanopoulos spent 30 hours with President Donald Trump, flying on Air Force One to Iowa, traveling in his armored vehicle called “The Beast,” greeting him in his West Wing residence, embedding in the Oval Office for a day of meetings, and sitting down for a one-on-one interview in the White House Rose Garden. This aired in a special edition of ""20/20,"" ""President Trump - 30 Hours,"" on Sunday, June 16, 2019.

Below are the unedited transcripts of the president’s exclusive interview with ABC News from ""The Beast"" between events in Iowa, the walk to and in the Oval Office and the Rose Garden.

STEPHANOPOULOS: This was-- you feel like this is your (inaudible)?

TRUMP: Yeah, I-- I do. I feel it's really-- really a great part of the country for us. Yeah.

STEPHANOPOULOS: This was the first state you ever (inaudible).

TRUMP: That's right. And I came in second. Should have come in first. But this was a caucus state. It was a whole different thing.

TRUMP: In the-- (inaudible). And I learned more in Iowa because we actually should have won Iowa easily by anywhere from five to 10 points. But caucus is different. People walk in. You talk to them. You know, it's-- it's like--

STEPHANOPOULOS: And they have to show up that night--

TRUMP: Look at the people. These are the people that couldn't get in, by the way. These people couldn't get in. Great people. It's a lot of-- Look at the-- look-- look at the people. They can't get in, George. A little different than my competitors.

STEPHANOPOULOS: Well, you don't have a real competitor. Just Bill Weld on the Republican side.

TRUMP: No, I'm talking about competitors, just generally.

STEPHANOPOULOS: So you feel good about Iowa right now?

TRUMP: Yeah, feel great about Iowa. Feel great about I think virtually every state that we're competing in. I think Iowa's great. I think Ohio and Florida, North Carolina, South Carolina. Pennsylvania I feel really good about. You know, we won--

TRUMP: --Pennsylvania. And it was interesting because Pennsylvania's always been tough to win, but we won it. And-- I think we should be doing great because of steel and all of the jobs that we've produced. They're having the best year they've had in I think 40 or 50 years.

STEPHANOPOULOS: You said Vice President Biden's making a mistake not telling people what you're for. I take that point. What-- elections are about tomorrow, not yesterday. When you go to voters over this next year, what is the big unfinished piece of business you're going to say, ""This is what we're going to get done?""

TRUMP: So we almost had health care done. Health care's a disaster, Obamacare. But we've managed it much better than they managed it. So we've made it serviceable, but it's not great. We almost had it done. We were one vote off, as you know. You know that whole story. And that was a very-- unfortunate situation. We would have had great health care. So we're going to do that if we win the House. If we win back the House, we're going to produce phenomenal health care. And we already have the concept of the plan, but it'll be less expensive than Obamacare by a lot. And it'll be much better health care--

STEPHANOPOULOS: Don't you have to tell people what the plan is?

TRUMP: Yeah, well, we'll be announcing that in about two months. Maybe less. So, yeah, sure you do. But-- but, again, that's-- that's subject to winning back the House, Senate and the presidency. You need the three. But we are--

STEPHANOPOULOS: Because that was one of the big issues that the vice president-- former vice president took on today. He said on health care you've called-- gone to the courts and said, ""We've got to overturn Obamacare."" That's abandoning people with preexisting conditions.

TRUMP: Well, no. Preexisting conditions-- I was for preexisting conditions. And I still-- you know, I'm very much for preexisting conditions. But Obamacare has been a disaster. Look what--

STEPHANOPOULOS: --get charged higher under your plan, right?

TRUMP: No, much lower. Under my plan, they'll be much lower. You'll see that in a month when we-- when we-- introduce it. We're going to have a plan. That's subject to winning the House, Senate, and presidency, which hopefully we'll win all three. We'll have phenomenal health care.

STEPHANOPOULOS: And you're g-- so you're definitely introducing a plan before the election?

TRUMP: Before the election, yes. We'll be having a plan much before the election. Soon. Fairly soon. It's almost--

STEPHANOPOULOS: How about the--

STEPHANOPOULOS: How about the economy? Where do you-- how-- how do you read it right now?

TRUMP: Well, I think the economy is fantastic, George. How does-- (inaudible). You have the best unemployment numbers we've had in 51 years. You have-- industrial numbers-- that are phenomenal. You look at GDP, 3.2 percent in the first quarter. People were shocked to see that. And that's despite the fact that I have various trade deals going on, which you have to do. I mean, I could f-- it would be much easier for me just to let China and all these countries continue to rip off the United States, but I can't do that. I don't want to do that.

STEPHANOPOULOS: Any concern about the softening job numbers over the last couple months--

TRUMP: No, none-- none-- really none. If we pull off the trade deals, which I think I will, we have a lot of power. With respect to trade, we have a lot of power. And-- we have great numbers. The companies are very strong. They've very liquid. Frankly, if we had a different person in the Federal Reserve that wouldn't have raised interest rates so much, we would have been at least a point and a half higher. I mean, three--

TRUMP: --3.2 percent is good. He's my pick. I agree. But, you know, we also have people in there that weren't my pick. But he's my pick. And-- I disagree with him entirely. As you know, it's independent.

STEPHANOPOULOS: I was going to ask you about that. What do you make of the critics who say it's just inappropriate for you to be talking about the Fed chairman--

TRUMP: Well, I'm allowed to. And, y-- you know, in the old days, they used to speak to the head of the Federal Reserve often. And it was a part-- very much a part of the administration from the standpoint as they'd talk and they'd-- (inaudible) settle. You have no idea how important it is. But I'm not happy with what he's done. I'm not happy with the fact that they've done quantitative tightening. Now, he doesn't make that decision himself. But I would think that the head of the Federal Reserve has quite a bit of power. No, I'm not happy. Now, if-- if we--

STEPHANOPOULOS: Do you have any concern you're putting him in a box--

TRUMP: Let-- let me explain. Yes, I do. But I'm going to do it anyway because-- I've waited long enough. If he did the interest rate increases half as much, if he didn't do tightening-- tightening means taking money out of the-- out of the till so that people can't use it for doing what they're doing. We call it quantitative tightening. If he didn't do tightening-- if he did nothing or perhaps even loosened, we would be in my opinion, just an opinion, 10,000 points higher than already a very high number. You know, we're-- from the time I got elected, we're about-- we're almost 50 percent up with the stock market. But if he didn't do the tightening and if he didn't do so much of an in-- it's okay to raise interest rates a little bit. But so much, it would have been-- it would have been even better.

TRUMP: And-- and I'll-- and I'll tell you something. What I don't like is when you raise the interest rates, there's no inflation-- there's virtually no inflation. When you raise interest rates, that means you're paying more in debt. And I inherited almost $21 trillion in debt. I inherited that. President Obama and Biden, they doubled the debt during their eight years. You know that. And--

STEPHANOPOULOS: It's been going up on--

STEPHANOPOULOS: --on your watch, too--

TRUMP: Sure. But I have to rebuild the military. They doubled the debt, and they didn't do anything. They doubled the debt on nonsense. I took over a military that was totally depleted. I have to rebuild it. The good news, we're rebuilding it here. We're building America. Everything's made in the U.S.A., and it's great. But I-- you know, it's one of those things. I have to rebuild the military. Otherwise, I mean, what's more important-- than our military? Especially in these days where you have such problems. And I think the stronger we are, the less likely it is that we use the military. We're close to being very, very strong. We're close to being stronger by far than ever before. But I took over a totally depleted military. And you know that. The planes were old. They talk about the grandchildren of pilots were flying the same plane as they were flying many years ago. We have beautiful new F-35s and F-18s and new-- rifles, new uniforms. In the case of the Army, we have the new uniforms that everybody's wanted for years. They're an expensive-- job. You know, you-- it doesn't sound it, but it is. And-- we have-- we have spent a tremendous amount of money on our military. And we did the right thing because we had to rebuild our military. It was totally-- it was in very bad shape. And you can see that when the military sees me. I fixed the vets. The vets-- the VA was in horrible shape. Now, they have choice. And nobody could get choice. John McCain couldn't get it. Nobody could get it. They tried for years. They couldn't get it. I got choice for the vets so that now instead of waiting in line for many, many weeks in some-- you know, in some cases they would wait for months to see a doctor. They died from waiting in line. Now, our vets have choice where they can go out, get a doctor, and we pay for the doctor. And it's--

STEPHANOPOULOS: In preparation for this trip, we went out and talked to a lot of voters here in Iowa, supporters of yours. And a lot of them say they voted for you, they're proud of you, they're going to vote for you again, most of them. Not all of them.

STEPHANOPOULOS: But will vote for you--

TRUMP: --we'll take in new ones, too--

STEPHANOPOULOS: But-- but this is what I want to ask you. Here's the concerns that some of them raise. Number one, we did hear a lot about tariffs. That the back-- that the-- farmers are especially concerned that your threats of tariffs are-- are going cost them their jobs, are going to cost them their livelihood.

TRUMP: Just wrong. The tariffs are what is allowing us to make great trade deals. If we didn't have tariffs, I couldn't have even spoken to Mexico. You understand that because you saw something that very few people saw. And I wouldn't have even been able to speak to Mexico. If we didn't have tariffs as-- it's a somewhat punitive measure. But if we didn't have tariffs, we wouldn't be able to speak to China. And I'm taking-- out of the billions of dollars that China's paying, I'm taking $16 billion out to give to farmers because that's what they lost because of China. And I'm making it up. And I'm taking it-- it all comes out of the tariffs that I'm collecting. So the tariffs--

STEPHANOPOULOS: Well, Americans are paying those tariffs.

TRUMP: No, they're not. Because China subsidizes their product in order to keep people working. And the companies-- most of the companies, many of the companies are moving out of China to areas that are tariff free, where they're non-tariff. So there is no tariff. And many of them are coming back to America. People don't understand tariffs, but I understand them. And I also understand the power of tariffs. And because of that, the farmer is going to be a big beneficiary in the end. But we gave $16 billion to the farmers. And all of that money came out of tariffs that we got from China.

STEPHANOPOULOS: Are you going to have to impose the Chinese tariffs?

TRUMP: I don't mind doing it. I mean, it's a tremendous amount of money. We have-- right now, we're getting 25 percent on $250 billion. And in the end, we're going to get probably 25 percent or so. And it could be even increased. But 25 percent on $550-$585 billion. That's hundreds of billions of dollars coming into our country. We never got 10 cents--

STEPHANOPOULOS: But if it's Americans--

STEPHANOPOULOS: --who are paying it--

TRUMP: No, it's not. George, China is subsidizing their product so that the product stays competitive so that they can keep selling. Not that they want to, but that's the way they're going to sell it. So if you take a look at inflation, inflation's hardly risen. I mean, har-- inflation is very low. That's one of the things I have against the Fed. With a low inflation, they should have kept interest rates where they were or just a small increase instead of raising them so much. He made a mistake. The Fed made a mistake. Despite that, we're doing phenomenally well. Despite everything I said, we're doing phenomenally well.

TRUMP: The tariffs have been very beneficial.

STEPHANOPOULOS: The other thing we're hearing from these-- again, these are voters who support you, still say they're proud of you. They wish you'd cut back on the tweets.

TRUMP: You know, I have it both ways. I have a very unfair press. It's a fake news. It's a corrupt news. I have people that are so dishonest. I mean, I had a case of it recently with the New York Times where they're writing things knowing it was wrong. Knowing. If I don't put it out-- I don't call it tweets. I call it social media. If I don't use social media, I do not get the word out. I have some people that do say that, but I have far more that say-- just today in the-- in the speech I had a woman, ""Please don't stop tweeting. Please. That's the only way you're getting the message out."" I have so many people that would go-- that would be very unhappy if I ever stopped. And it's not tweet. It's social media. I put it out, and then it goes onto your platform. It goes onto ABC. It goes onto the networks. It goes onto all over cable. It's an incredible--

STEPHANOPOULOS: So for you, it's just--

STEPHANOPOULOS: --a tool you're never going to give up?

TRUMP: Well, it's-- it-- how can I communicate like that? I put one out this morning. And as soon as I pressed the button, they said, ""We have breaking news."" Every network, every station. ""We have breaking news."" They read my tweet. Why is that bad? And when I'm treated badly by the press-- and nobody's ever been treated badly like me. When I'm treated so badly--

STEPHANOPOULOS: You know that every president says that.

TRUMP: I-- I disagree. Look, it's been acknowledged. Although they do say Abraham Lincoln was treated really badly. I must say that's the one. If you can believe it, Abraham Lincoln was treated supposedly very badly. But nobody's been treated badly like me. And this way I can fight the dishonest media, the corrupt media, the fake news.

STEPHANOPOULOS: And could do-- what they're talking about though is you calling people names. It's demeaning--

TRUMP: Well, you know what? I'll bet they do like it. They may tell you that, but I'll bet they like it, you know? We've gotten great poll numbers recently. Tremendous poll numbers. And a lot of people don't want to talk about it, but they're all Trump voters. They're going to be Trump voters. And that happened in the elections. I mean, one of the things that just happened recently in our election in 2016-- and, by the way, even in the 2018 for Senate, people didn't want to talk about it. They just voted. They voted for Trump people. Now, I campaigned for senators because, you know, you--

STEPHANOPOULOS: And you got hit hard in the House.

TRUMP: Well, I didn't campaign for the House. Remember this also. I wanted to say, ""I'm running. I'm running. I'm running."" But I wasn't running. There's a big difference when I run and when I just say, ""Hey, I hope you vote for somebody."" But look at Senate. We had 51. They thought they were going to take over the Senate, and we took it from 51 to 53. And we have some incredible new senators right now--

TRUMP: --in the Senate. And we didn't get credit for that.

TRUMP: We never got credit for that.

STEPHANOPOULOS: --poll number for you today. Quinnipiac Poll showed your approval rating was up 42 (inaudible).

STEPHANOPOULOS: And-- and before you fight me over the number, let me ask--

TRUMP: No, no. But let me just tell you that Rasmussen just came out today. I'm at 50 percent.

STEPHANOPOULOS: Yeah, that-- that-- Rasmussen has been--

STEPHANOPOULOS: --consistently higher for you. That's-- that's true--

TRUMP: But Rasmussen-- well, I don't know c-- Quinnipiac has never been accurate for me. Rasmussen was the m-- one of the most accurate polls. There were three of them to be exact. One of the three was Rasmussen for the election itself. They called it almost perfectly. Rasmussen today was at 50 percent. And they also say that new people that (inaudible) involved and stay involved in polls, those people are voting for (inaudible).

STEPHANOPOULOS: Here's the thing. Everyone looks at it (inaudible) got to go beyond (inaudible) House races in--

STEPHANOPOULOS: How do you do it?

TRUMP: We're having the same conversation (inaudible) announced that I was running (inaudible). And guess what?

TRUMP: No, I'm just telling you I'm going to do it the same way I did it the first time. A lot of people don't talk. Even the day of the election, they came out with the exit poll. And everyone said, ""Oh, Trump's going to be ((inaudible)."" (inaudible) He's a very talented political (inaudible). He said, ""You're going to win big tonight. You're going to get maybe three out of six in the college."" He said, ""You're winning Florida. You're winning North Carolina. We think you're going to win Pennsylvania. You're winning South Carolina tremendously. You're winning Ohio. We think we're going win-- Wisconsin and Michigan."" And you know what it was? They walk out and they say, ""We don't want to talk to you."" They say, ""Who are you voting for?"" ""We don't want to talk to you."" Almost everyone who said that voted for Trump. They didn't understand it.

STEPHANOPOULOS: I know you have to go. What's your pitch to the swing voter on the fence?

TRUMP: Safety, security, great economy. And, you know, for women-- as you know, I did very well with women last time. I was hearing I wouldn't have. I'd say, ""Why? Why? Explain."" I did very well with women--

TRUMP: Well, I got 52 percent. And I will tell you-- in my opinion I might have won women. I-- I think that-- hey, Hillary Clinton focused on women, and I did phenomenally well. Many, many, many points above what they thought. Frankly, I think we're going to do tremendously now with African Americans, with Asians, with Hispanics because they have the lowest unemployment numbers they've ever had in the history of the country.

STEPHANOPOULOS: So that's the pitch?

TRUMP: No, I-- I have no pitch. You know what I have? The economy is phenomenal. We've rebuilt our military. We're taking care of our vets. We're doing the best job that anybody's done probably as a first-term president. I think I've done more than any other first-term president ever. I have a phony witch hunt, which is just a phony pile of stuff. Mueller comes out. There's no collusion. And essentially a ruling that no obstruction. And they (inaudible).

TRUMP: They found no collusion. And they didn't find anything having to do with obstruction because they made the ruling based on his comments and (inaudible).

TRUMP: Are you trying to say now that there was collusion even though he said there was no collusion?

STEPHANOPOULOS: He didn't say that.

TRUMP: He said no collusion.

TRUMP: George, the report said no collusion.

TRUMP: You should read it, too, George.

THE WALK TO AND IN THE OVAL OFFICE:

STEPHANOPOULOS: How are you? Have a good night?

TRUMP: Very good night. Had a good day and a good night.

TRUMP: Probably I average four or five hours or something like that. I actually got back last night – you were with us – it was very interesting. I came home and worked a little bit and then--

TRUMP: Uh I’m not a breakfast guy at all, fortunately. I like the lunches but the dinners is what I really like. And I think you’re going to be staying around for this. This is--

STEPHANOPOULOS: Yeah, looking forward to this.

TRUMP: This is going to be something today.

STEPHANOPOULOS: You know, this colonnade. I remember I was with President Obama, in one of his final days in office, he said in some ways this was his favorite part of the White House, where he really made some of his big decisions, what does it mean for you?

TRUMP: It’s an incredible part of the White House, it is and you see it all of your life and you know you see president's walking back and forth with others. This is an incredible place. And you have a ramp over there, and the ramp you can see was put in and it actually doesn’t qualify under… because it’s supposed to be more gradual--

TRUMP: But that was put in for FDR. He didn’t want anybody lifting him with the wheelchair. So you have ramps throughout certain areas of the White House. But, uh this one over here was, uh, it’s pretty tough to walk down it, actually. I’m always a little bit careful walking down that ramp, it’s steep.

STEPHANOPOULOS: Do you feel the weight of the office when you’re walking down this colonnade?

TRUMP: I think about the office walking down. This is a... I – just because you’ve grown up looking at this colonnade, look there are the cameras in another hour from now we have a ceremony on Poland. But you’ll see hundreds of cameras out there and this is what they’re looking at. See you grow up looking at it and you say “wow, I’m now a part of it.” It’s a very special house. The whole White House is a special place.

STEPHANOPOULOS: It’s a long way from coming down that escalator, four years ago.

TRUMP: It is, it’s a long way. It’s been actually a lot fun. Highly competitive, the world is highly competitive, but I think we’re doing a great job. I don’t think anybody has done more in two and a half years than what I’ve done with regulation, with taxes, with… actually believe it or not with world events. We get along with a lot of countries that people don’t understand but they respect us again.

STEPHANOPOULOS: What’s the most fun part of the job?

DONALD TRUMP: I think just the accomplishment of doing a lot of good things for a lot people. We’re-

TRUMP: We’re handling the vets, you know, we have choice, you’ve seen that and so many others things we’ve been able to do for the vets. The hardest is usually the Congress, I find Congress more difficult than frankly than many of the foreign leaders.

STEPHANOPOULOS: Why is that?

TRUMP: Because they have their own views, you never know exactly but they have their own views and--

TRUMP: Yeah, I guess it is, but... And I… so many things like the border, the border should be done, George. The border... The Democrats should come in and 15 minutes to an hour we can have it all solved. It’s so simple.

STEPHANOPOULOS: But that would mean you’d have to give some stuff as well.

TRUMP: Well, but it’s not even giving stuff. The things that we’re talking about you shouldn’t have to give. It’s so-- there are three and four loopholes you solve those loopholes you no longer have a problem at the border. They should want to do it. But they don’t want to do it because of political reasons.

STEPHANOPOULOS: Is that your big--

TRUMP: That’s why if we can take over the House, we will have things done like never before.

STEPHANOPOULOS: Is that your biggest unfinished piece of business? I remember we spoke on that first day in June of 2015 you were talking about the border, you were talking about the wall, more people crossing the border than ever before right now.

TRUMP: Well, that’s because the economy is so good, they try to come into our country. We have many more people wanting to come in and they come for economic reasons, they not coming for asylum... asylum is a way--

TRUMP: Really, they’re coming though… most of them for economic reasons, and the country is doing better economically than ever before and everybody wants to crack in. I think we’ve done a great job on the border. We're apprehending more people than ever before under our new Mexico plan. That’s going to help a lot because, you know, you’re going to see the numbers go way down. But really we should be able to do it much easier than that. If the Democrats sat down for fifteen minutes we could work it out.

STEPHANOPOULOS: Last time we here, I guess you were sitting, what, in this? Was it in that office what with Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer on the infrastructure? What happened there?

TRUMP: Ah, very basic, I very calmly said “Listen, I just heard you talking about something that’s not the appropriate thing for you to be talking about and then we had a meeting afterwards so let’s just take a pass.” It was a very simple statement, given very calmly. I then came out and made a press conference…

TRUMP: --on something unrelated. Totally unrelated, but, uh, wasn’t a big deal. Then they walk out and say “he was stomping and romping and slamming the table…” These people are not honest people.

STEPHANOPOULOS: We’re about to walk into the Oval Office, where do you make your biggest decisions? Is it in there? Is it upstairs? Is it in your study?

TRUMP: I really - all over. It's in the plane sometimes going to a country. It’s in the strangest places. But uh, the Oval Office.

STEPHANOPOULOS: It just hits you?

TRUMP: Ok, the Oval Office is such a special place. I have the biggest people - yesterday I had some of the biggest business people in the world in my office and they have beautiful offices perhaps more beautiful than the Oval Office, although to me there is nothing more beautiful because of what it represents. But they walk into the Oval Office for the first time and they just – they just want to look around. It’s a special place.

TRUMP: So, that’s a very famous desk. It's the resolute desk and that was Ronald Reagan, that was--

TRUMP: JFK, and there’s a very famous picture of John-John right here.

STEPHANOPOULOS: President Clinton used that as well.

TRUMP: President Clinton used it, a number of great presidents used it and frankly I had my choice -- you have your choice of seven desks. They have seven desks and that was the one that immediately -- that was the one that I liked.

STEPHANOPOULOS: How do you -- I mean, do they give you a catalog?

TRUMP: They actually do. They give you pictures of desks. They give you pictures of carpet. This is the Ronald Reagan carpet. They give you pictures of the drapes. You see the drapes? They say - I think we have 12 sets of drapes we can use and I chose those drapes. But, uh… It’s really something…

STEPHANOPOULOS: What’s the biggest personal touch you’ve put on the office?

TRUMP: I put a lot of them. The flags. You didn’t have flags to any great degree. You had an American flag, but for the most part you didn’t have flags. Uh, it’s quite a bit different than President Obama. Uh he had some fairly modern paintings, a couple. We didn’t want that. We brought it back to Lincoln, Andrew Jackson, Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Jefferson, Hamilton, George Washington, very famous picture of George Washington and I like that.

STEPHANOPOULOS: Do you actually do -- do you actually do work in here? Or is it all for meetings?

TRUMP: I do work in here, I have most of the meetings in here. People like to be in the room. It’s very comfortable, and back there I have a tremendous amount of work. In fact, you’d see it’s a much different uh, effect. You can’t have – every time we have pictures everyone wants a picture, you don’t want to take all things off your desk so I have a desk back here that I actually use much more.

STEPHANOPOULOS: Do you find you can use the power of this setting to get your way? You’re talking to those CEOs coming in here…

TRUMP: I don’t think about it. I don’t really uh, you know, I don't focus on that, but I think probably it’s true. If somebody is sitting here and you’re in the Oval Office for the first time which most people aren’t, it amazes me, I go into a meeting and we’ll have twenty five really big executives. I said how many, and they’ve been here for a long time, how many seen the Oval Office, nobody raises their hands and I say you’ve never been in? And the heads of royal companies and car companies and other presidents did not make the Oval Office easily available and I do. I - You know when I have heads of corporations, and by the way people that are not doing so well also, people that are having problems with life, I bring them in also. So I make it, you know, it’s really a very inspiring place.

STEPHANOPOULOS: Tell us about the first time you sat down at that desk as president, I imagine is that where you read the letter from President Obama?

TRUMP: I did. I read the letter there, I don’t know if you ever seen the letter. Have you ever seen the letter?

TRUMP: He actually wrote a very beautiful letter, and uh, it’s uh, it’s very interesting what’s happened it’s very interesting, but he wrote me a letter which is a custom and he put it right in the drawer, the center drawer and I opened it and I saw the letter I read it and I thought it was very nice and I have it. Uh, right there that’s more judges I’m signing, we’ve signed a 107 judges since I’m in, and I’ll get a 145 plus two supreme court judges which we already have and the numbers should be quite a bit higher than that. Ultimately, the judges will go, I inherited almost 145 judges, which is shocking. But they couldn’t get them through or something happened at the last two or three years of the Obama administration where he was not getting judges. I’m not talking about Supreme Court judges, which happened also with Merrick Garland. I’m talking about regular judges and court of appeal judges, federal judges, but I had 145, that’s a shocking number.

STEPHANOPOULOS: You think that--

TRUMP: So, that’s going to be a big percentage of the judiciary. And there are those that say, because of that this will be a big part of the…

STEPHANOPOULOS: Well that’s what I was going to ask you, you also have two Supreme Court justices do you think that could be your most lasting impact?

TRUMP: Well it could, I mean people have said that. I don’t think of it that way. Because we’ve given the biggest tax cut in history, we have ANWR, we have, uh, the biggest regulation cut by far.

STEPHANOPOULOS: The tax cut come and go, judges make decisions for generations…

TRUMP: They do and they do and regulation cuts come and go, but the reason the economy is so good and the reason that so many people are pouring up through Mexico and wanting to come into our country, including people from Mexico is because economy is so powerful. It’s so good. So, that’s all important, but there are those that say the thing I’ve done best is judges, and we’ll see.

STEPHANOPOULOS: Before you got here, you--

STEPHANOPOULOS: --already sent out three tweets this morning. I’m usually at my desk between 6:30 and 7 when they start to come in, and it seems like you’re very conscious of kind of - you’re going to set the news for the day before all of us do.

TRUMP: No, I don’t think of it that way. It obviously didn’t work because I watched your show this morning. I watched Good Morning America and they had something about the polling, and it’s really suppression polling. It’s fake polling, but in that case it was just made up polling, and I had--

TRUMP: I had the same thing and-- made up, I mean, they give you phony numbers, they give you numbers, they said that they have access to numbers, which I don’t believe they have access to. But-but I went through it in 2016, I was going to be tied in Texas, it was going to be very close, I won by a lot. I was going to be tied Utah, I won by a lot now I was going to lose Pennsylvania, I won it. I was going to lose North Carolina, I won it. I mean it was all phony polling. It’s actually phony polling and I believe it’s suppression. They suppress, they want to suppress the minds of people so they don’t bother going out and voting.

STEPHANOPOULOS: But you think there’s a real conspiracy?

TRUMP: No, I just think it’s just a bad group of people, and it shouldn’t be allowed, but that’s no different than the fake news and the fake news is at a level that it’s never been at before.

STEPHANOPOULOS: You and I, we know we disagree about that, but we have a whole day ahead to go on this. Before we go, one of the things you have as president is access to all the information all the mysteries out there I was just struck in the last couple weeks, we’re reading more and more reports of navy pilots seeing lots and lots of UFOs. Have you been briefed on that?

STEPHANOPOULOS: What do you make of it?

TRUMP: I think it’s probably, uh, I want them to think whatever they think, they do say, I mean, I’ve seen and I’ve read and I’ve heard, and I did have one very brief meeting on it. But people are saying they’re seeing UFO’s, do I believe it? Not particularly.

STEPHANOPOULOS: Do you think you’d know if there were evidence of extraterrestrials?

TRUMP: Well, I think my great pilots-- our great pilots would know. And some of them really see things that are a little bit different than in the past, so we’re going to see, but we’ll watch it. You’ll be the first to know.

STEPHANOPOULOS: Mr. President, thank you. Have a good day.

TRUMP: Thank you, George. ... Different things. Judges get things like this too, these are also other positions…. United States--

STEPHANOPOULOS: I still have mine framed somewhere

TRUMP: These are ambassadors. That’s really something, isn’t it? Secretary of the Interior. This is, uh, let’s see, United States district judge of the Eastern District of Missouri. Great state, Missouri.

STEPHANOPOULOS: You won that pretty well.

TRUMP: I won it well. I won it well. This is…United States District Judge, Western District of North Carolina, great state. But you see, all the judges and many of these President Obama just, something happened, he didn’t…

STEPHANOPOULOS: He ran into Mitch McConnell, didn’t he?

TRUMP: I don’t know, I mean, perhaps. But I ended up with 145 judges, nobody has ever had anything like that happen.

TRUMP: It’s a tremendous difference. United States District Court; Utah. Another great one, right? Utah.

STEPHANOPOULOS: You know, this just made me think of something. Several of even your Republican senators when you came in where kind of skeptical of you. And now it seems like they are 100 percent in line, what happened?

TRUMP: I have a great relationship-- hey, they found out I am very smart and I know what I’m doing. You know, they didn’t know I was never a politician before. I had, what, 15 debates and we won every debate. According to every poll, I mean I can only tell you by the polls. But every poll, they had many polls, doing many debates, I never lost one poll I think they’ve gained a certain respect.

STEPHANOPOULOS: And respect for your base.

TRUMP: And they respect my base. I respect my base. I think I have the greatest base in the history of politics because they are not believers in false things. Now, I have to explain it and that’s one of the great things about social media. If you do a bad story, I can explain it away. For instance, on Good Morning America today they had that phony polling information. I explained to you last night that it was phony, but you didn’t do anything about it. You should have, but it was late in the evening and perhaps you didn’t get a chance.

STEPHANOPOULOS: I didn’t see the piece this morning. I’ve listened to, I’ve studied those polls, I’ve heard the explanations--

STEPHANOPOULOS: But, why does it bother you so much?

TRUMP: Because, it’s untrue. I like the truth. I’m actually a very honest guy. If I thought they were correct, I wouldn’t be complaining at all. I understand that. It’s like the witch hunt that goes on. No collusion with Russia, there was no collusion. And what bothers me--

STEPHANOPOULOS: As you know, that’s not what--

TRUMP: You know, can I, it’s what it says--

TRUMP: That’s what it says. It said no collusion. You know what, nobody even brings Russia up anymore. They talk about phase two but it’s a total phony deal. If it weren’t, if I colluded with Russia, it wouldn’t bother me nearly as much. What bothers me, is when you did nothing wrong and they have a phony witch hunt. That bothers me. And Mueller, who hates Trump, he is a never Trumper and then he puts--

STEPHANOPOULOS: What evidence do you have that he hates you?

TRUMP: George, I know he hates me. And then he puts 18 people on who are Democrats.

TRUMP: Well, they are very close. And they were contributors to Hillary and some of them even worked for Hillary Clinton.

TRUMP: And Weissmann was a bad guy. And they put all these people on. So I am being judged by 18 people that truly dislike Donald Trump. I mean in many cases hate. Weissmann was at Hillary Clinton’s, it was supposed to be a party, it turned out to be a wake. It turned out to be a funeral. But, Weissmann was there.

STEPHANOPOULOS: You called Robert Mueller honorable, why the switch?

TRUMP: I’m not switching or anything. I would hope he is honorable. But you know what, he gave us no collusion and that was a very big thing.

STEPHANOPOULOS: He did not say that.

TRUMP: And frankly, frankly, he did say that. He said there was no collusion. George, read the report.

STEPHANOPOULOS: He said he explicitly didn’t look at collusion-- I did. He said there was insufficient evidence that said there was a conspiracy. I read every page.

TRUMP: Excuse me, read the report, read the conclusion of the report, just read it. Ok, I mean look you are one that said Donald Trump is not going to win and then you smiled when I got into the race, and you laughed. You and Maggie Haberman would laugh ‘haha’ that was so funny and I will give your deputy chairman of the DNC credit. Because he looked at the two of you and said, sorry to tell you but Donald Trump is going to win.

STEPHANOPOULOS: And you are President of the United States today.

TRUMP: And you laughed because you thought it was ridiculous and Maggie Haberman of the New York Times who knows nothing about me, by the way, I rarely speak to her, she laughed and thought it was so funny. The people that didn’t think it was funny were the people that voted for me.

STEPHANOPOULOS: And you are here right now. You are President of The United States.

STEPHANOPOULOS: Yet it seems like you just feel this need to push back at perceived enemies.

TRUMP: No. At false stories, at fake news. Because nobody has any idea how corrupt the media is. They are corrupt. Not all of it, fortunately. But the media is corrupt.

STEPHANOPOULOS: You word it all by continuing to say that the media is corrupt, that this is all fake news but when you need the media at a time of national crisis we’re not going to have the kind of unity we need.

TRUMP: I’m not worried about it, no. I’m not worried about it. We are doing very well and we are going to be just fine. I am just saying, I know stories, so I know what I did, what I didn’t do. When I have someone writing a story that is so opposite the facts, and a lot of the people out there now they believe me - the media has gone way, way down in terms of approval numbers. I think they are lower than Congress right now. And you know what, when they started, I think they were in the 90s, now they are in the teens.

STEPHANOPOULOS: I'm not sure the media has ever been in the 90s, but to keep talking about the truth and we are trying to stay on the facts as well and you know you have been cited many times for not telling the full truth with Robert Mueller, he didn’t look at collusion, he found 126 contacts between your campaign and Russia, said it was not a conspiracy, that is true.

TRUMP: Excuse me, what about Hillary Clinton? Hillary Clinton conspired with Russia. She had somebody that came out of Russia. They got information from Russia. Excuse me. Hillary Clinton was totally involved with it. That's the one - if you talk about collusion with Russia take a look at Christopher Steele, all his contacts with Russia which by the way she paid for, and turned out to be a phony deal, which everyone is now admitting that. No George, all I want is the truth. All I want is fairness.

STEPHANOPOULOS: But you say that for example you were pursuing a Trump Tower in Moscow during the campaign and denying any relationship with Russia.

TRUMP: George, let me tell you: I didn’t even do a deal in Moscow, do you know we, I don’t even think they had--

STEPHANOPOULOS: You were pursuing it.

TRUMP: Excuse me, excuse me. Pursuing, what does pursuing mean? You know because someone walks in, says, “Hey we’re looking at...” Do you know that I don’t even think they had a site? I don’t even think they knew who was going to do the deal. It was a concept of a deal, more of a concept than anything else. It was a concept of a deal someplace in Russia, probably in Moscow, and I was looking at places all over the world--

STEPHANOPOULOS: But didn’t voters have a right to know that?

TRUMP: I wouldn’t mind telling them. There’s nothing wrong with it--

STEPHANOPOULOS: But if you--

TRUMP: In fact I was, I didn’t consider that pursuing a deal when you don’t even have a site. Do you know how many people, how many things I look at? You didn’t even have a site in Moscow, they didn’t know what they were doing in Moscow, there was virtually no work done on it by me certainly, by me. By the way, by my son, by Don. And, I’m looking at things all over the world. When you will see my financial statement, at some point I assume it’s going to be released, you’ll be very impressed by the job I’ve done. Much, much bigger, much, much better than anybody--

TRUMP: Uhh, they’re after my financial statement. Now, they should be after everyone else’s financial statement but, uhh, they are after, the Senate, they’d like to get my financial statement. At some point, I hope they get it--

STEPHANOPOULOS: You going to turn it over?

TRUMP: No, at some point, I might, but at some point I hope they get it because it’s a financ--, it’s a fantastic financial statement. It’s a fantastic financial statement. And let’s do that over, he’s coughing in the middle of my answer.

TRUMP: I don’t like that, you know, I don’t like that.

TRUMP: If you’re going to cough, please leave the room. You just can’t, you just can’t cough. Boy oh boy. Okay, do you want to do that a little differently than uhh--

TRUMP: So at some point--so at some point, I look forward to, frankly, I’d like to have people see my financial statement because it’s phenomenal--

STEPHANOPOULOS: It’s up to you--

TRUMP: No, it’s not up to me. It’s up to lawyers, it’s up to everything else. But they’re asking for things that they should never be asking for, that they’ve never asked another president for. They want to go through every deal that they’ve ever done, they’ve--what they’re doing is a disgrace.

STEPHANOPOULOS: You know other presidents have turned over their tax returns.

TRUMP: They’re trying to do: step, step, step. They want to keep it going as long as possible to try to demean and hurt as much as possible so they can possibly win the presidential election. They’re not going to win the presidential election. Nobody’s done, in two and a half years, the job I’ve done as president. The economy is one of the best in the history of our country. Taxes are lower than they’ve been, almost ever, almost ever, certainly in the last fifty years. We’ve done a job with the vets. We’ve done a job with just about everything, even Obamacare, it was almost terminated, except for one vote by John McCain, but it was almost terminated. If it would’ve been terminated, we would have great--

STEPHANOPOULOS: Most of (inaudible) wanted (inaudible) to be terminated--

TRUMP: No, people hate Obamacare. It’s too expensive, it’s not good, but if we win the House, we win the Senate, we win the presidency. You’re going have the greatest healthcare that anybody’s ever had.

STEPHANOPOULOS: And you said, yesterday you told me, you’re going have a plan, in what, the next couple of weeks?

TRUMP: I’m going have a plan over the next month--

TRUMP: --for healthcare. And it’s going be a great plan. Now, that’s all subject because the Democrats won’t vote for it. It’s not their kind of a thing, because it’s too good, but we’re going have a great healthcare plan, but we have to win the House, we have to win the Senate, we have to win the presidency.

TRUMP: Thank you very much. Do you agree with the cough? I hate to have a cough in the middle of a (inaudible). ... No, but don’t you agree with that? Some (inaudible)...look, here’s another judge. Here’s a, uh, an intelligence advisor board. It’s pretty amazing. (inaudible) three or four judges pretty much every other day.

TRUMP: I love it. And these are great people. Uh, we’re going --we’re very careful in judges. We’re, umm, getting phenomenal--in fact, we have very good marks on the judges we’ve appointed. And they’re not judges you might like, but they’re judges that a lot of folks that like me, they like them a lot--

STEPHANOPOULOS: You’re a fighter. You, you, it feels like you’re in a constant kind of churn--

TRUMP: Yeah, uh, my life has always been a fight. And I enjoy that I guess, I don’t know if I enjoy it or not, I gue--sometimes I have false fights like the Russian witch hunt. That’s a false fight. That’s a made-up, uh, hoax. And I had to fight that--

STEPHANOPOULOS: The first line of his report says they had a systematic attempt at interfere in (inaudible) relations.

TRUMP: They did, but not me. And they also said, okay, that we rebuffed them. Okay?

STEPHANOPOULOS: Well they said you’re (inaudible).

TRUMP: That the Trump campaign. Excuse me. The campaign, the Trump campaign rebuffed them. We had nothing to do with Russia. Hillary Clinton had much more to do with Russia than anything having to do without campaign. It said very specifically that not only that we didn’t have to do, but we rebuffed them. Now anything having to do with Russia had nothing to do with our campaign.

TRUMP: Paul Manafort, they have Paul Manafort on taxes and many other things. Nothing to do with our campaign.

TRUMP: I don’t know anything about that. What difference does polling information make? It doesn’t matter. He was maybe trying to do something for an account or something. Who knows? But they said specifically that there was nothing to do, and we in fact rebuffed them--

STEPHANOPOULOS: They said there were hundreds (inaudible)--

STEPHANOPOULOS: --what they said is that--

TRUMP: They also said that there were bloggers in Moscow and they said specifically about the bloggers in Moscow, had nothing to do with Trump, had nothing to do with the--and there were like 32 or 36 bloggers. We have nothing to do with bloggers in Mo--in Moscow. I’ll tell you, you talk about collusion, take a look at the collusion with the Democrat party and Facebook and Google and Twitter. That’s called collusion, that’s called real collusion. Not where somebody buys some ads and the other thing, having to do with Russia. They were also helping the Clinton campaign, you know that. It wasn’t just Trump. And Putin, I will say this: if he had it, it was up to him. He would much rather have Hillary Clinton be president right now. And all of these countries would rather have Biden or anybody else but Trump.

STEPHANOPOULOS: He said he was trying to help elect you. He said that explicitly.

TRUMP: Well he might’ve said that after I won, because it’s a smart thing to say. Okay?

STEPHANOPOULOS: And Mueller says that he’s trying to do that--

TRUMP: Mueller said that we rebuffed Russia, that we pushed them away, that we weren’t interested. Read the report.

STEPHANOPOULOS: I have read the report. On that though your son Don Jr. is up before the Senate Intelligence Committee today, and again, he was not charged with anything. In retrospect though--

TRUMP: I mean not only wasn’t he charged, if you read it, with all of the horrible fake news, I mean, I was reading that my son was going to go to jail. This is a good young man. That he was going to go to jail and all of these horrible stories. And then the report comes out and they didn’t even say, they-they--hardly talked about him.

STEPHANOPOULOS: (inaudible) going to the FBI when he got that email.

TRUMP: Okay, let’s put yourself in a position: you’re a congressman, somebody comes up and says, “Hey I have information on your opponent.” Do you call the FBI?

STEPHANOPOULOS: (inaudible) if it’s coming from Russia you do.

TRUMP: I’ll tell you what: I’ve seen a lot of things over my life. I don’t think in my whole life I’ve ever called the FBI. In my whole life. You don’t call the FBI. You throw somebody out of your office, you do whatever you--

STEPHANOPOULOS: Al Gore got a stolen briefing book. He called the FBI.

TRUMP: Well, that’s different. A stolen briefing book. This isn’t a (inaudible). This is somebody who said “We have information on your opponent.” Oh, let me call the FBI. Give me a break, life doesn’t work that way.

STEPHANOPOULOS: The FBI Director says that’s what should happen.

TRUMP: The FBI Director is wrong. Because, frankly, it doesn’t happen like that in life. Now, maybe it will start happening. Maybe today you think differently, but two or three years ago, if somebody comes into your office with oppo research--they call it oppo research--with information that might be good or bad or something, but good for you, bad for your opponent, you don’t call the FBI. I would guarantee you that 90 percent, could be 100 percent of the congressmen or the senators over there, have had meetings, if they didn’t they probably wouldn’t be elected, on negative information about their opponent--

TRUMP: They don’t pro--possibly. Possibly. But they don’t call the FBI. You don’t call the FBI every time some--you hear something that maybe--. Now, you see the people. The meeting, it also sounds to me, I don’t know anything about that meeting, but it sounds to me like it was a big nothing. That meeting was a big nothing. But I heard about my son, who is a great young man, going to jail over a meeting where somebody said I have information on Hillary Clinton. She’s the one who should be in jail. She deleted 33--

STEPHANOPOULOS: She should be in jail?

TRUMP: She deleted 33,000 emails from, sent by the United States Congress. They gave a subpoena to Hillary Clinton for 33,000 emails. After the subpoena was gotten, she deleted them. That’s called obstruction. And her lawyer should also be looked at because her lawyer, she’s got to have the greatest lawyer on earth because she does that, he did the deleting supposedly, not only did they delete, but they acid washed them.

TRUMP: Now that’s called the--no, no. No, no. It’s being investigated I assume now.

STEPHANOPOULOS: You haven’t asked (inaudible) to take a look into--

TRUMP: --and I don’t talk to, I don’t talk to. We have a great attorney general now. I don’t talk to my attorney general about that, but I’ll tell you what: when you send 33…They requested 33,000 emails. She got the request. They deleted every one of them. Okay? If you did that, you would’ve been put in jail--

STEPHANOPOULOS: Your campaign this time around, if foreigners, if Russia, if China, if someone else offers you information on opponents, should they accept it or should they call the FBI?

TRUMP: I think maybe you do both. I think you might want to listen, I don’t, there’s nothing wrong with listening. If somebody called from a country, Norway, “We have information on your opponent.” Oh, I think I’d want to hear it.

STEPHANOPOULOS: You want that kind of interference in our elections?

TRUMP: It’s not an interference, they have information. I think I’d take it. If I thought there was something wrong, I’d go maybe to the FBI. If I thought there was something wrong. But when somebody comes up with oppo research, right, that they come up with oppo research. Oh, let’s call the FBI. The FBI doesn’t have enough agents to take care of it, but you go and talk honestly to congressmen, they all do it, they always have. And that’s the way it is. It’s called oppo research.

TRUMP: Thank you. Okay. Fine.

STEPHANOPOULOS: So I was listening to you introduce the first lady in there. And it made me think of this: How is Barron doing?

TRUMP: Barron's doing fantastically. He's here. He likes soccer. He's doing a great job.

TRUMP: He likes the White House. Likes it.

TRUMP: --it, it's not too tough.

STEPHANOPOULOS: Not too shabby. We-- we've spoken on a lot of the big moments over the last few years--

TRUMP: George, are we on now?

STEPHANOPOULOS: Yeah. One year ago today, we were in Singapore right after your meeting with Kim Jong Un. And you told me that you trust him. And you also put out that tweet. ""There's no longer a nuclear threat from North Korea."" But they-- there is a nuclear threat today, isn't there--

TRUMP: Well, it could change. I would say not much. There's been no testing, no anything. But it could--

STEPHANOPOULOS: But they have stockpiles.

TRUMP: --change, George. It could change. And when it changes, I'll let you know. But right now-- I will actually show you the letter. But-- I'd show it to you a little bit off the record. But it was-- a very nice letter. But I've received many very nice letters. And he's a very tough guy. He's a very smart person. He doesn't treat a lot of people very well, but he's been treating me well. Now, at some point that may change. And then I'll have to change, too. But right now, we have a very good, you know, relationship. We have a really very strong relationship--

STEPHANOPOULOS: So you still trust him?

TRUMP: Well, look, I-- I don't-- I-- first of all, if I didn't, I couldn't tell you that. It would be very insulting to him. But the answer is, yeah, I believe that he would like to do something. I believe he respects me. It doesn't mean it's going to get done. This has been going on for many, many decades with the family. But I get along with him really well, I think I understand him, and I think he understands me. And there's never been a relationship with him or his family. And that was at his choice and their choice. They never wanted to have a relationship with us.

STEPHANOPOULOS: But there have been these cycles, as you know, with the family, with North Korea-- with President Clinton, with President George W. Bush.

TRUMP: And everybody gave him a lot. President Clinton gave him billions and billions of dollars and got nothing. I've given nothing. Now--

STEPHANOPOULOS: But do you worry that he--

STEPHANOPOULOS: --could be playing you, too?

TRUMP: Well, look, I put on sanctions. The sanctions are on. We've gotten our hostages back. We've gotten-- the remains. And they continue to come back, the remains of our-- our great heroes from the past--

STEPHANOPOULOS: Did they try to make you pay for Otto Warmbier?

TRUMP: He-- w-- when you say ""me,"" not me--

TRUMP: Because I didn't know him at that time. That was a very different deal. But here's the bottom line. I ended it. We didn't pay. We never paid. What he did with other people in the State Department, that's irrelevant. And it might not be him. It might be his people. But we never paid for Otto. And I have great respect for Otto's parents. And what happened to Otto is horrible, horrible. But we never paid for Otto. And I will tell you I ended it. But that was before I knew him. I didn't know him at all. That was a long time ago now it seems. But a lot of things have happened. And there's been no nuclear testing. There's been essentially no testing whatsoever except for very short range. And that's something that a lot of nations test frankly, what he tested. I think we've made tremendous progress. Now, I will let you know if it goes the other way. And it can, and it can happen instantly. But we've done a very good job. George, prior to my getting here, nuclear testing all over the place. Moving mountains. I mean, moving-- this was serious nuclear stuff. There's nothing like that. You don't even hear about anything.

STEPHANOPOULOS: Do you think he's still building nuclear weapons?

TRUMP: I don't know. I hope not. He promised me he wouldn't be. He promised we-- me he wouldn't be testing. I think he'd like to meet again. And I think he likes me a lot. And I think-- you know, I think that we have a chance to do something.

TRUMP: I'll tell you what he likes. He's a very smart person. And that country has-- almost of any undeveloped country anywhere in the world, that country has the chance to be economically a behemoth. And he can--

STEPHANOPOULOS: If he released-- if he stopped--

TRUMP: --lead it. And he can lead it--

STEPHANOPOULOS: --imprisoning his own people and starving his own people.

TRUMP: I'm not talking about that. I'm talking about from an economic standpoint. He's between China, Russia, and speak. It's all in the oceans. It's phenomenal. It's-- it's a phenomenal location. That country can be so rich. And he knows that. And I think he really wants to do that. And the only way he's going to do it is it's going to do it-- has to do it in a non-nuclear way.

TRUMP: And that's what we care about.

STEPHANOPOULOS: It appears that meeting with you is dangerous for members of his negotiating team.

TRUMP: Somebody said, ""Well, I guess he's a tougher negotiator maybe than we thought."" The fact is that I don't know what happened with the five people. One person I think (SIREN) that we spotted. You know, the-- the lead. And he certainly seemed to be healthy. I have no idea whether or not anything happened to anybody else. You know, you hear all sorts of stories, but I don't know that--

TRUMP: --they're true. And you would never know and probably wouldn't be able to find out very easily.

STEPHANOPOULOS: Not easy. It's a closed society. One final question on that. You had that question yesterday about-- Kim Jong Un's half-brother and who may have been a CIA asset before your time. You said it wouldn't happen on your auspices. Explain what you meant by that.

TRUMP: Well, they say he worked for the CIA. And I think frankly that we're beyond that point in terms of a relationship. And I don't think it would have to happen. I think that Kim Jong Un-- and you've heard many bad things about him, but you've heard from me different things. I think that Kim Jong Un wants to see a very-- has a chance to do something that would be unique. He could have almost an instantaneously wealthy behemoth. It could be an incredibly wealthy, successful--

STEPHANOPOULOS: So we don't have to spy on--

TRUMP: Well, I-- I'm not going to say we're going to or we're not going to. But it didn't happen during my-- with respect to his brother, it didn't happen during my auspices, during the time that I'm here.

STEPHANOPOULOS: Lift a veil on your strategy here. You know, I listen to you every single day. All Americans do. Especially over these last couple days. You know, you-- ""The-- the-- the press are enemy of the people. Fake news. Joe Biden's a loser, low IQ."" Yet all these warm words--

TRUMP: And other people are very good. No, I--

STEPHANOPOULOS: --for Kim Jong-- no, but explain the strategy--

TRUMP: I say nice things about you.

TRUMP: Maybe you're in that category.

STEPHANOPOULOS: You never know. But I-- but w-- th-- there seems to be a dissonance there.

TRUMP: I don't think so. I say a lot of nice things about a lot of people that are very soft and nice. And I say good things about lots of people. Look, I'm running-- I'm in charge of a very, very special gift. It's this incredible country. I'm dealing with people. Some might be nice, and some might not be nice. But I've done a great job. You know, when I got elected, everyone thought we were going to be at war the following day. Hasn't turned out to be. And our country is now more respected than it's been in many, many decades. We're more respected now than we were in many decades. I've been rebuilding the military. Our military was totally depleted between President Bush with the Middle East and, you know, just-- it was a terrible decision to go into the Middle East. Terrible, terrible. I-- I happen to think it was the worst decision made in the history of our country, going into the Middle-- it's like quicksand. And, by the way, Iraq did not knock down the World Trade Center. It was not Iraq. It were other people. And I think I know who the other people were. And you might also. But-- it was a terrible decision--

TRUMP: It was a terrible decision to go into the Middle East. Terrible. We're now up to almost $8 trillion. And when we want to build a roadway, a highway, a school, or something, everyone's always fighting over money. It's ridiculous. So that was a bad decision. President Obama didn't spend money on military. It wasn't his thing. He didn't want to spend. So I inherited a very depleted military. You can't have a depleted military today. And we have now a military that's very close to being at a level that we haven't had it in many, many decades.

STEPHANOPOULOS: We talked about Russia before, but we haven't talked about Robert Mueller's evidence on obstruction of justice. The attorney general said you didn't commit obstruction of justice. Robert Mueller said he's not reaching a decision-- could not exonerate you. And he laid out all that evidence. More than a thousand former federal prosecutors--

TRUMP: Oh, that's-- but they're all--

TRUMP: --politicians. Hey George. Look, I know more about prosecutors than you'll ever know. They're politicians. I could get you 5,000 that would also say that there's nothing. You know, I-- I saw their names. And these are all-- many of them are Trump haters. Many of them if you look at the names.

TRUMP: I could get you thousands. You know how many prosecutors there have been over the-- if you add them all up? We could get you thousands of prosecutors. I've been treated so unfairly because I never did anything. There was no crime. The crime was committed by the Democrats. It was committed by your friend Hillary Clinton. The crime was committed by them. The crime was committed by Comey and all of these people. Now, we're going to find out. Because I guess there's an investigation. I stay away from it, but I guess there's an investigation going on. George, I could get you thousands of prosecutors that say this is the most unfair-- you take a man like Alan Dershowitz, who's a very brilliant guy. He thinks this is one of the worst things ever to happen to our country because I've been unfairly treated. Even a question like that's unfair.

TRUMP: But they're taking-- they're taking people and you're taking people, and you're-- I could get you thousands of prosecutors--

STEPHANOPOULOS: Mr. President, there's nothing unfair about the question.

TRUMP: --to say whatever I want them to say--

STEPHANOPOULOS: One of the-- one of those prosecutors today, Kamala Harris, running for president--

TRUMP: Oh, give me a break. She's running for president. She's doing horribly. She's way down in the polls.

STEPHANOPOULOS: She said she would have no choice--

TRUMP: And I must say Pocahontas is--

STEPHANOPOULOS: --but to prosecute you.

TRUMP: --really-- cleaning her clock. And I heard she made that statement. And you know what? Who wouldn't? Probably if I were running in her position, I'd make the same statement. There was no crime. There was no Russia collusion. There was no Russia, I'll put it in your language, conspiracy, which is even better than collusion. You know, the word ""collusion"" is a softer word than ""conspiracy."" If you look at what Robert Mueller wrote-- who's no lover of Donald Trump I will tell you. Frankly, he was conflicted. He shouldn't even be allowed to do it. No special counsel should have ever been appointed. You know why? Because there was no crime.

TRUMP: They had no-- excuse me. They had no evidence of crime.

STEPHANOPOULOS: He lays out a lot of evidence, including the episode where you ask your White House counsel, Don McGahn-- you tell him, ""Mueller has to go."" You call him twice--

STEPHANOPOULOS: --and say, ""Mueller has to go. Call me when it's done.""

TRUMP: And there-- now, the story on that very simply, number one, I was never going to fire Mueller. I never suggested firing Mueller. Do I think--

STEPHANOPOULOS: That's not what he said.

TRUMP: Excuse-- I don't care what he says. It doesn't matter. That was to show everyone what a good counsel he was. Now, he may have gotten confused with the fact that I've always said, and I've said it to you, and I've said to anybody that would listen Robert Mueller was conflicted. He was conflicted because we had a business transaction where I wouldn't give him back a deposit--

STEPHANOPOULOS: But Mueller writes about that--

TRUMP: --that he wanted. Excuse me.

STEPHANOPOULOS: He writes about that. Steve Bannon told you it was ridiculous.

TRUMP: Steve Bannon is trivial. Doesn't even know about it or hardly would kb at it. But he had a total conflict. He also happened to have a very good friendship and relationship with Comey. So if Mueller has a relationship with Comey and a very close relationship, right then and there he's conflicted.

STEPHANOPOULOS: But why would Don McGahn lie--

TRUMP: But we had a business-- wait a minute--

STEPHANOPOULOS: Why would he lie under oath? Why would he lie--

TRUMP: Because he wanted to make--

TRUMP: --himself look like a good lawyer. Or-- or he believed it because I would constantly tell anybody that would listen, including you, including the media, that Robert Mueller was conflicted. Robert Mueller had a total conflict of interest--

STEPHANOPOULOS: And has to go?

TRUMP: I never s-- I didn't say that. If I-- look, Article II. I would be allowed to fire Robert Mueller. There was n-- assuming-- assuming I did all of the things, I said I want to fire him, number one, I didn't. He wasn't fired. Okay? Number one, very importantly. But more importantly, Article II allows me to do whatever I want. Article II would have allowed me to fire him.

STEPHANOPOULOS: So it sounds like you--

TRUMP: But I wasn't going to fire. You know why? Because I watched Richard Nixon go around firing everybody, and that didn't work out too well. So very simply, Article II would allow me to do it. But Don McGahn thought he did a great favor. And maybe he even believes it. But that never happened. And I have people that will tell you it didn't happen.

TRUMP: Because I didn't want to fire Mueller, but I thought Mueller frankly should not have been appointed--

TRUMP: Let-- let me just tell you something. Robert Mueller had a conflict. I would say it to anybody that would listen. He was totally conflicted. He had numerous conflicts. One of them was the fact that he applied for the job to be the FBI-- the head of the FBI. And, by the way--

STEPHANOPOULOS: Steve Bannon said he didn't. That's in the report--

TRUMP: Steve Bannon wouldn't know. Steve Bannon has no idea. Steve Bannon was not in the room. He was in line. I can get you two people that work in the White House office, in the Oval Office to tell you he was standing in line along with other people applying for the job. I was interviewing people. That's when we made a deal with Chris Wray. Robert Mueller wanted the job. He wanted to go back as the FBI director. That's perfectly fine. But I told him no. And then the next day he's appointed special prosecutor or shortly thereafter. I think it was actually the next day. He's appointed special counsel? That's a conflict--

STEPHANOPOULOS: The report says he didn't--

TRUMP: George, that's a conflict. It was in the papers--

STEPHANOPOULOS: But the-- the report says he didn't--

TRUMP: It was in--

STEPHANOPOULOS: --apply. But let-- let's-- I want to talk--

TRUMP: It was in-- George, it was in the newspapers. He came into my office. He wanted to be FBI director again. And I said no.

STEPHANOPOULOS: The report says that's not true. But let's talk about this Article II thing.

TRUMP: Excuse me. Don't-- don't just, you know, shove it out like that. He applied for a job. I said no. And the next day, he's my-- he's my person that's going to be taking a look at me? Also, business conflict. Also, we had a conflict with-- with Comey. He had a-- his friend is Comey. So don't tell me about this, George.

STEPHANOPOULOS: You talk about Article II. So your position is that you can hire or fire anybody, stop or start--

TRUMP: That is the position of a lot of great lawyers. That's the position of some of the most talented lawyers. And you have to have a position like that because you're the president. But without even bringing up Article II, which absolutely gives you every right--

TRUMP: A president can run the country. And that's what happened, George. I run the country, and I run it well.

STEPHANOPOULOS: When the president does it, it's not illegal?

TRUMP: I'm just saying a president under Article II-- it's very strong. Read it. Do you have Article II? Read it.

STEPHANOPOULOS: I know what Article II says--

TRUMP: Read it. No, read it.

STEPHANOPOULOS: --in front of me. I--

TRUMP: Read it for your audience.

STEPHANOPOULOS: It-- it-- it talks about executive power. But your position--

TRUMP: You know what? Let's get onto another subject that's a very simple subject, Article II. But besides that, Mueller had conflicts.

STEPHANOPOULOS: But if you answer these questions to me now, why not answer them to Robert Mueller under oath?

TRUMP: Because they were looking to get us for lies or slight misstatements. I looked at what happened to people, and it was very unfair. Very, very unfair. Very unfair.

STEPHANOPOULOS: So you-- it was the right thing not to answer the questions?

STEPHANOPOULOS: Happy to. So I'm listening to you. You're not worried about being prosecuted once you leave office?

TRUMP: Did nothing wrong, George. Did nothing wrong. There was no collusion. (SIREN) You don't even hear Russia mentioned anymore. Are you guys okay? ... There was no collusion. You don't even hear Russia mentioned anymore. Russ- Russia's not mentioned. Now, it's all about obstruct-- obstruction of what? They built up a phony crime. They hired a man that hated Trump. He hired 18 people that were Democrats that hated Trump. Some of them contributed to Clinton's campaign. A couple of them worked for Clinton. I mean, what kind of a rigged deal is this? (THROAT CLEARING) And then on top of it, after two years and after being the most transparent in history, I gave them 1.5 million pages of documents, right? I gave them four or five hundred witnesses. I let Don McGahn testify. I let him say-- he was the White House counsel. I let him testi--

STEPHANOPOULOS: But you knew he was--

STEPHANOPOULOS: --an interview. You didn't answer questions on obstruction.

TRUMP: Wait a minute. Wait a minute. I did answer questions. I answered them in writing.

TRUMP: I don't know about this-- I don't know. I answered a lot of questions. They gave me questions. I answered them in writing.

TRUMP: Look. George, you're being a little wise guy, okay-- which is, you know, typical for you. Just so you understand. Very simple. It's very simple. There was no crime. There was no collusion. The big thing's collusion. Now, there's no collusion. That means they set-- it was a setup. In my opinion, and I think it's going to come out.

STEPHANOPOULOS: Who set it up--

TRUMP: I hope it's going to come out. We're going to find out very soon. Because I really believe it's going to come out. When you look at Strzok, these FBI guys that were lowlives, when you look-- because the FBI's the greatest. But these-- the top people were absolutely lowlives. When you look at Strzok and Page and they're talking about an insurance policy just in case she loses, that was the insurance policy--

STEPHANOPOULOS: You know, I've heard you talk about that--

TRUMP: George, I went through the insurance policy.

STEPHANOPOULOS: I understand that. But if they were determined to prevent you from becoming president, why wouldn't they leak it beforehand?

TRUMP: You know what--

STEPHANOPOULOS: It didn't come out before the election--

TRUMP: You'd have to ask them. Oh, they tried. They tried. You know, it's an amazing thing. Probably one of the few times I respected the press is that the f-- the dossier, that fake news dossier, that fake pile of garbage that Comey knew about and all of these people-- and they paid a fortune for-- and Hillary Clinton paid for it. And the Democrats, okay? And they got information from Russia that turned out to be false. But that fake dossier, if you like that, they used that all over the place. And the one time I respected the press because they did the right thing, they wouldn't print it. They couldn't get it printed. They tried it to be before the election. If that would have happened before the election, I could have lost.

TRUMP: No, no. Because the newspapers would not print it. I cannot believe it. Because I've-- I've so lost confidence in press. I've so lost-- as you probably know, I've so lost confidence in media. I think it's disgraceful. They do societies that are so false. Everything-- I mean, almost everything. They do so many false. The one time, they could not get the fake dossier printed prior to the election. It came out a number of weeks after the election, and it didn't mean, you know, as much except I said, ""Boy, that's terrible. What a fake deal that is."" But had that been printed before the election, that could have changed the whole election. And that's what they wanted to do: steal. And Comey and all these lowlives, they wanted to have that fake dossier, which was all phony stuff. They wanted it to go out before the election, George. And you know what? Had that gone out before the election, I-- I don't think I could've-- I don't think I would've had enough time to defend myself--

STEPHANOPOULOS: You clearly believe there was-- a group of people working against you. Do you think President Obama was behind it?

TRUMP: I would say that he certainly must have known about it because it went very high up in the chain. But you're going to find that out. I'm not going to make-- that statement quite yet. But I would say that President Obama had to know about it.

STEPHANOPOULOS: How are you going to put this behind you?

TRUMP: Well, I would put it behind. I wouldn't have answered any of these questions. I wouldn't have made the statement except you start off with your first question is about this.

STEPHANOPOULOS: My first question was about Barron, and I had a ton of questions--

TRUMP: Good, you said about Barron. You get immediately onto this. People are fixated. No collusion, no obstruction. Because the attorney general, who's a great gentleman and a highly respected man, based on the evidence given said, ""There's no obstruction here."" And Rod Rosenstein--

TRUMP: --agreed with him. Rod Rosenstein-- which is a big thing. He agreed with him.

STEPHANOPOULOS: And you think that's the final word? You're not worried about what happens in Congress?

TRUMP: Look. The Republicans in the Senate, every single one of them that I see know this is a witch hunt. They get it 100 percent. And that's what matters. The Democrats are going to do it only because they might think it helps them. I think it actually hurts them in the election. But there's never been a time in the history of our country where somebody was so mistreated as I have been. And this should never, ever be allowed to happen to another president again. A previous administration used the intelligence data and the intelligence agencies to spy on my campaign.

STEPHANOPOULOS: Do you believe that President Obama spied on your campaign--

TRUMP: I don't know. But hopefully we're going to find out.

STEPHANOPOULOS: Final question. When this is all over, whether it's a year and a half from now or five and a half years from now, how do you want to be remembered as president?

TRUMP: As a president that loved the people, took care of the people, made our economy tremendous, built up our military, took care of our vets. Our vets are doing fantastically now with choice. Somebody that really loved the country and did a great job, whether it's four years or hopefully it's eight years. Because I still have work to do. Somebody that did a really great job for the country.

STEPHANOPOULOS: Mr. President, thank you for your time.

TRUMP: Thank you very much."

187,3,"The heap of ashes behind Jay Inslee used to be an acute-care center in Paradise, Calif.

Now it was a backdrop for the message the Democrat was about to bring to the 2020 presidential campaign trail — the message he has embraced for more than two decades.

“We can’t allow climate deniers in the White House,” Inslee said in a short video he posted to Twitter soon after the deadly November wildfire. “You can’t stand here and say you don’t believe in climate change.”

Inslee, who is serving his second term as governor of Washington, doesn’t see climate change as an issue for the next president of the United States to address. He sees it as the issue.

It’s why he’s turned flooded towns in Iowa and burn zones in California into campaign stops; it’s why he’s giving headaches to Democratic leaders by demanding a climate debate.

“My wife and I had a discussion about this,” Inslee, 68, said about his decision to run for president on a climate platform. “We wanted to be able to say we did everything we could. And we realize how diminished and degraded and despoiled my grandchildren’s lives will be if we don’t get a president in the next term to make it job number one.”

Inslee grew up hiking, skiing and kayaking and lives on idyllic Bainbridge Island outside Seattle. His parents were amateur conservationists who helped restore the alpine meadows on Mt. Rainier in the summers.

As a congressman from Washington state, he warned his fellow representatives in July 1999 about “insidious” greenhouse gases overheating the planet.

Inslee saw an obvious solution: The government could help create a clean-energy economy to cut emissions and create jobs.

The transformation didn’t happen. But the story of Inslee’s political career is that if at first you don’t succeed, you can try, try again — and again, and again, and again.

“He’s like the Energizer Bunny in that regard,” said Brian Bonlender, a former congressional chief of staff and former head of Washington’s Department of Commerce under Inslee. “He will not stop.”

Climate scientists warn that world leaders are running out of time to prevent a future of scorching temperatures, rising oceans, worsening natural disasters.

But President Trump’s administration has unapologetically rolled back Obama-era environmental policies meant to monitor and limit climate change.

“We got a guy in the White House telling us that the climate crisis is a Chinese hoax. What a bunch of baloney,” Inslee said after visiting businesses damaged in recent Iowa flooding, anger creeping into his voice.

“It makes me” — Inslee searched a moment for the word, settling on a safe folksiness — “hopping mad, as you can tell.”

The governor’s campaign will be a test of whether a climate-focused candidacy can translate into the kind of environmentalist victories recently seen in European elections.

Inslee hasn’t polled above the low single digits but has secured enough donors to qualify for the first round of Democratic primary debates.

The satire publication the Onion has taken notice and has caricatured the Bunyanesque governor as the Democratic field’s own Captain Planet, armed with a solar-powered mech suit and guarded by a loyal pack of dolphins. “We need someone like him who’s going to prioritize the planet over being elected,” The Onion ribbed.

The Democratic National Committee has refused his call for a climate debate, drawing condemnations from environmentalists and prominent Democrats including former Vice President Al Gore.

It’s the same kind of politically inconvenient demand Inslee has made of his fellow politicians for the last 20 years, when the timing has rarely ever been right.

In 2003, Inslee compared U.S. leaders to the tyrant Nero, who “sang while Rome burned,” for not having acted more aggressively in studying clean-energy technologies. In 2005, he proposed the 476-page “New Apollo Energy Act” to domestically develop green tech and cut oil use. (It didn’t pass.)

He also led a push in 2010 for then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton to block the Keystone XL pipeline, which has since been approved by the Trump administration.

After Inslee became governor of Washington in 2013, he pressed his warnings locally, struggling to win cooperation from the Republicans then controlling the state Senate.

But there are signs that more policymakers are coming around to Inslee’s philosophy of pairing clean-energy investment with jobs, housing and other liberal policy initiatives. Now congressional Democrats are discussing a Green New Deal to transform the economy to produce clean energy.

“He was one of the people who was arguing for a Green New Deal before the Green New Deal was the Green New Deal,” said Michael Brune, the executive director of the Sierra Club environmentalist group. “He doesn’t get much credit for that.”

Several Democratic presidential candidates have now proposed aggressive climate investment programs. But Inslee’s plan, which includes closing all coal plants by 2030 and investing $3 trillion in emissions-efficient transportation, infrastructure and housing, has received the biggest raves from climate experts and activists.

“@JayInslee’s climate plan is the most serious + comprehensive one to address our crisis in the 2020 field,” Democratic New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a key proponent of the Green New Deal, tweeted in May.

Inslee also secured perhaps the biggest climate-policy breakthrough of his career this spring with the signing of a law requiring Washington state to adopt 100% clean energy by 2045. The victory was made possible after Democratic state senators gained a majority in 2017.

Nationally, Inslee is betting that the political opening for a climate-centered candidacy will keep growing as voters encounter more and more disasters linked to the effects of climate change: bigger wildfires, heavier floods, rising oceans.

“When you’re surfing, you gotta wait for the wave,” Inslee said in a recent interview. “The wave is showing up now in the form of Paradise, Calif., burning to the foundations; Iowa and Nebraska being underwater; Miami Beach being flooded. Seattle, Wash., had to close its swimming pools last summer because of the smoke [from wildfires]. So the wave has arrived.”

In March, Inslee visited Agoura Hills, Calif., where the Woolsey fire had razed the Seminole Springs mobile home park to the foundations.

“Trying to stop these forest fires just with raking the leaves is like trying to turn back the rising tide with a spoon,” Inslee said during the visit, mocking a suggestion made by Trump.

Marsha Maus, 75, who’d lost her home, hugged Inslee. “Thank you for what you do. You give me hope.”

On a recent campaign visit to Davenport, Iowa, Inslee toured businesses along the Mississippi River that had been deluged by record flooding. Workers tossed plastic bags filled with waterlogged belongings into dumpsters as Inslee talked to three women who help run the Dress for Success store. The nonprofit, which provided clothes for women in need, lost half its inventory.

“There’s not enough sandbags in the world to protect you from these floods,” Inslee told them.

LuAnn Haydon, a Dress for Success board member, agreed, urging immediate action to halt climate change. “Look at the fires all over California. Look at the floods in the Midwest. It’s not going to stop,” she told Inslee.

So far, Inslee’s focus on climate hasn’t led to a breakout moment on the trail.

His low profile in the race is common for governors, his campaign staff says, citing Bill Clinton’s successful 1992 presidential campaign as a little-known, slow-starting governor from Arkansas.

They believe Inslee will also benefit if voters learn about his liberal record on matters other than climate change. Under him, Washington had the first state-level net neutrality law; the first state-run public health insurance option; free college for low-income students; a ban on the death penalty; and guaranteed paid family leave.

Inslee supports the U.S. Senate abolishing the filibuster and theorizes that progressives can secure lasting victories with just 50% majorities.

“We’ve never actually gone backwards once we’ve embraced any degree of social change, from Social Security, to Medicare, to Obamacare, to civil rights, to gay marriage equality,” Inslee said. “Once you win, you only have to win once.”

But he worries that other Democratic candidates, who lack his lifetime of effort, are treating the issue as one policy battle among many.

“You can’t totally restructure the United States economy to be a clean economy by mid-century by putting it on your to-do list,” Inslee said. “This has to be the central defining mobilizing tenet and organizing principle of your entire administration.

“And I am convinced to a moral certainty,” he said, “that I’m the only candidate who has the fire in the belly to actually do it.”"

190,3,"During the impassioned Los Angeles teachers’ strike earlier this year, one of the chief disputes was whether charter schools were a lifeline to students who deserve an alternative to low-performing district schools, or a leech that insidiously siphons money from a public school system struggling to fulfill its obligation to educate the vast majority of L.A.’s students. After the strike ended in January, Gov. Gavin Newsom called for a task force to study that question and other charter-related issues to inform future policy decisions.

Now the task force has wrapped up its work, and it is depressing to find that it didn’t accomplish what was supposed to be its overriding goal. The group’s report included several reasonable recommendations for overdue reform of California’s charter schools. But we still don’t know whether charters are draining vital resources at publicly run schools or having a minimal impact on them.

That question has been at the forefront of anti-charter complaints across California. Enrollment has been shrinking significantly in the Los Angeles Unified School District, with a hefty amount of that caused by the growth of charter schools, which enroll more than 100,000 students within the district. State funding for those students follows them from the district schools to the charters.

The answer is key to the hot topic of how strictly to control charter expansion in California, if at all. Many charter schools offer an educational lifeline to students who otherwise would have to attend low-performing district-run schools. But the state also has an obligation to keep the money drain associated with charters from harming traditional public education, which will always be needed and which serves the vast majority of students.

Enter the Fray: First takes on the news of the minute »

Supporters of charter schools say that districts don’t need the money because they no longer have to educate the students who leave. Charter skeptics point out that districts still have fixed costs, such as buildings and administration, and that students don’t always leave in numbers that allow a school to shrink their roster of teachers.

What’s been needed is an objective analysis that serves as the foundation for considering any policy changes, such as whether to let districts consider the financial impact of a new charter school when deciding whether to grant approval, or whether to place a temporary moratorium on charters. There are various pieces of legislation designed to address these issues; all of them are controversial, and some are making more progress through the Legislature than others.

One proposal in the report calls for continuing to pay schools for each student they lose to charters for one year to help them adjust to the shift in revenue. Is it too much money? Too little? Taxpayers who would pick up that extra tab of paying twice in one year for the same student have no way of knowing because the research hasn’t been done. Who decides what the financial impact of charters would be in the absence of a state analysis of the actual effect? Allowing school boards, which have a vested interest in the outcome, to do that would be like handing the hen house keys to the local fox.

The report is on shaky ground when it comes to financial issues because it simply didn’t do its homework on them. It had a few school districts make presentations; it looked at analyses compiled by others. But school districts are of course not disinterested parties. And the outside analyses were conducted by groups or people with pro- or anti-charter leanings.

It’s not surprising, then, that the most useful recommendations from the task force have nothing to do with charters’ fiscal impact. Those include having a state body set the standards for authorizing and overseeing charter schools, given that better oversight has been needed for years; taking away the State Board of Education’s authority to approve charter applications on appeal, because people on both sides of the debate agree that the board provides little oversight; and banning school districts from approving charter schools outside their own boundaries.

Thanks to the task force for providing some useful ideas. But if the state wanted to learn the facts about the financial impacts of charter schools, it might have been better off asking the Legislative Analyst’s Office to do the work, or the state auditor. With nothing more than this report to guide policy, California will be arguing charter school finance well into the future.

193,3,"An Instagram couple from Germany is getting ridiculed on social media after setting up a GoFundMe page to fund their trip to Africa.

Cat and Elena of the Instagram account Another Beautiful Day have come under fire for requesting 10,000 euros ($11,234) to help them go on a “huge adventure” to Africa starting late July. According to GoFundMe and the couple’s Instagram page, the pair are planning on tandem cycling from the “middle of Germany” toward “Africa, and hopefully beyond.”

The two, who did not give specific destinations, described the vague trip as “a celebration of life.”

“We want to take you all on this huge adventure,” the GoFundMe page read. “A celebration of life, as we ride freely across mountains, by the sea and through metropolitans. We will show the beauty of this planet and its inhabitants, but also the ugliness.”

The pair said the money raised would go toward the bike and gear as well as food, accommodations, Internet, SIM cards in every country, insurance and to cover for emergencies if they arise.

“We hope you all enjoy and learn with us,” the post continued before concluding “Together we can make a difference.”

Since posting the money-seeking post, the couple has been ripped apart for being “narcissist.”

“Or you could tell people to save their money up and go and have the experiences themselves not ‘through you’. Total liberty!” one wrote on Instagram.

“You want people to fund your lifestyle lol. Pathetic. Get jobs and support yourselves. You narcissistic cretins. You’re not even raising money for a good cause. You’re literally asking people to fund your holiday wtf. What a waste of life you are,” one person harshly stated.

In a follow-up post, Cat tried to play down the negative responses by claiming the couple had the “courage” to ask and accept help. Cat also shared that the couple are currently being funded by his mother – who he described is working two jobs and does not much for herself, The Sun reported.

“Some people are quick to judge and speak. At this very moment we don’t have much, we are accepting money from my mother and also donations but we don’t hide that. This situation is teaching us a lot,” a caption read, along with the hashtag “trying to do something bigger.”

Those on social media continued to slam the couple on all platforms.

“Wow , don’t you feel ashamed to be such a burden on your mother that is working 2 jobs to support both of your lavish fantasy’s … she already sacrificed so much raising you and providing for you , at that age you should be taking off burdens of her not adding to it,” one person wrote on the GoFundMe.

“Get a couple of jobs and support yourselves!” another commented.

“Posting your holiday photos to Instagram isn’t changing the world, it’s purely increasing your already inflated sense of self-worth. If you want to plan an epic trip, get a job and earn the money yourselves. No more handouts from Mummy (who is currently working 2 jobs while you post selfies for a living) or expecting strangers to maintain your lifestyle. Time to enter the real world,” one wrote.

Cat posted on the couple’s Instagram that he will be taking a 30-day break from social media to do some “soul searching,” though it was not clear if the monthlong leave was fueled by the response from his followers or if it was previously planned."

196,3,"It’s time for agricultural researchers to take better advantage of the massive amount of data they produce and move into an era of “big science.” Open data—data that are publicly available and have been intentionally prepared for reuse and innovation by others—is the path to the research breakthroughs of the future. But to make that move, agricultural science must change in significant ways. That’s what our seven-person task force concluded in a report published March 11 for the Council for Agricultural Science and Technology.

Small science—researchers working alone or in little groups, analyzing, interpreting, and sharing only their most important result(s)—is no longer adequate to improve world food production, nutrition enhancement, food safety, and disease prevention, all while protecting the environment. Teams from different disciplines, working with robust data sets and widely available and shared information are what’s required today to make substantive progress on complex problems that transect traditional disciplines.

But there are impediments to implementing big science in agricultural research. One is the lack of access to the data that are already out there. Plenty of data are produced but not shared. Lack of data accessibility diminishes the value of public investment in science as it is a barrier to making better decisions in agriculture. Without evidence-based decision making, policy leans too much and too often on expert opinion and partial information.

In agricultural research, approaches to research design and data collection are rarely standardized across studies, and data access and use by others remains dependent on individual agreements and one-time, trial-and-error solutions for data transfer.

We need an infrastructure to support data sharing and its routine synthesis into agriculture practice and policy. This would empower a statistical approach for combining multiple studies and lead to a better understanding of experimental results. The concept is not new. It is done routinely by medicine and other disciplines to translate science into effective practice. It should happen in agriculture too.

To that end, we call for the creation of centralized “knowledgebases” linking emerging institutional and discipline repositories for agricultural research data. At the National Center for Biotechnology Information, for example, genetic sequence data from thousands of species are housed as are the tools developed to search them. As a result, researchers are rapidly identifying the functions of genes, causes of diseases, and human evolutionary signatures. This simply could not be done if genetic/genomic data were dispersed across hundreds of individual researchers’ lab computers. The challenge is extending this model to the diverse methods and scales of studies designed to understand the interactions of plant and animal genetics with the varied and ever-changing management technologies and environments in which they are used.

Although challenging to achieve, establishing similar knowledgebase infrastructure for agricultural sciences would facilitate the organization of research data according to principles articulated in the acronym F.A.I.R.: data must be Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable. Such knowledgebases would serve not only as portals to data reuse, but would create value-added data products based on anticipated interests and objectives of scientists and innovators seeking data for new projects. Examples of these include fusions of data from similar field experiments with regional mapping data of soil properties and in-stream monitoring for water quality to support sustainability metrics for food supply chains. But how can we do this?

First, agriculture researchers will need to partner with data scientists who know how to assemble information into forms that can be mined for trends, filtered for promising ideas, and translated for end-users. Colleges and universities will need to reorient themselves to support team science and data sharing. Undergraduate and graduate curricula must include some understanding of data sciences and their use in food-systems research. Professional assessment and reward systems for professors have to factor in the broader array of faculty activities associated with team science.

A strong data-sharing program should include information not currently fully represented by peer-reviewed publications. For example, data sets inclusive of all information on crops, soils, environment, and other meta-data acquired by individual researchers and universities need to be embedded with each scholarly publication; at present, publications include only a fraction of the data and meta-data researchers collect.

Regarding peer-reviewed literature itself, more needs to be done to publish studies with negative results or verification studies that confirm previously published research results. Many journals specifically discourage authors from submitting “non-novel” results; researchers have responded by skipping the time-consuming process of pushing their less scientifically exciting results into this formal record of science. Yet, these are critical to an unbiased foundation for evidence-based agricultural practice. One idea: the use of “registered reports” where peer-approved proposals are registered prior to data collection assuring that authors will publish their results no matter the findings.

Other data inefficiencies also exist in agricultural science. At present, individual US Department of Agriculture agencies such as the Agricultural Research Service, the Farm Service Agency, the Forest Service, and the National Agricultural Statistics Service, separately maintain and pay for their own geospatial data platforms. It is inefficient for multiple organizations to create their own stop-gap solutions. Pooling data sets and creating one-stop shopping is more cost-effective and efficient, and simplifies data discovery.

One of the keys to making data more available is changing the business model of agencies that fund agricultural research. Granting agencies should require data sharing and pooling, whenever possible. And perhaps funding agencies should pay directly—in proportion to the amount they award—for the infrastructure needed to create a “national center for agricultural research information.” It’s an investment that would pay for itself many times over.

198,3,"Democrats have been hoping that a wave of successes in recent Virginia elections will move them into control of the legislature for the first time since 1995. The party in charge in 2021 will oversee the next statewide re­districting effort, following next year’s census — potentially cementing an advantage in future elections.

The 5-to-4 decision did not shed light on how courts should consider claims of racial gerrymandering, but rather who has the right to sue. The court is considering potentially more groundbreaking cases about partisan gerrymandering, in maps drawn by Republicans in North Carolina and Democrats in Maryland.

The court has never found that politics have so infected a redistricting process that voters’ constitutional rights were violated. Its decision in those cases will come before the end of the month.

“The State of Virginia would rather stop than fight on,” she wrote. “One House of its bicameral legislature cannot alone continue the litigation against the will of its partners in the legislative process.”

Ginsburg was joined in an unusual alignment by fellow liberal Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan, as well as conservatives Clarence Thomas and Neil M. Gorsuch. Because Thomas is the senior justice in that coalition, he would have assigned the opinion to Ginsburg.

Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. dissented, saying he saw no support “for the proposition that Virginia law bars the House from defending, in its own right, the constitutionality of a districting plan.” He was joined by fellow conservatives Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. and Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh, as well as liberal Justice Stephen G. Breyer.

The districts have been subject to legal challenges ever since they were drawn in 2011. Republicans controlled the House of Delegates at the time and Democrats the state Senate. Under a deal, Republicans drew the map for the House, and Democrats drew the one for the Senate without interference from the other chamber.

But courts eventually found that legislators had placed too much emphasis on race in drawing the lines, and a panel of federal judges found that 11 House districts were improper. The House declined the court’s offer to draw new maps, and the court hired an expert to do the work.

It realigned 26 House districts as it remedied the 11 under court order. Republican incumbents in six of those districts will find it more difficult to defend their seats against Democratic challengers this November, according to an analysis by the nonpartisan Virginia Public Access Project. Primaries were held last week in the new districts.

“Today’s Supreme Court ruling is a victory for democracy and voting rights in our Commonwealth,” Gov. Ralph Northam (D) said in a written statement. “When we corrected racially gerrymandered districts earlier this year, we righted a wrong — as I have always said, voters should choose their representatives, not the other way around.”

“It’s unfortunate that House Republicans wasted millions of taxpayer dollars and months of litigation in a futile effort to protect racially gerrymandered districts, but the good news is that this fall’s elections will take place in constitutionally drawn districts,” Herring said in a statement.

“The broader implications of this holding will reverberate across the states, touching virtually every area of politically charged law,” he said in a statement. “The Court has sown to the winds of expediency and will reap a whirlwind of partisan mischief as state attorneys general pick and choose which laws they will defend and which they will disregard on behalf of those plaintiffs with which they are politically or ideologically aligned.”

The Trump administration filed a friend-of-the-court brief that essentially agreed with Herring, saying the House of Delegates as an institution has no inherent interest in the shape of its districts or who gets elected to represent them.

Ginsburg agreed. “The House does not select its own members,” she wrote. “Instead, it is a representative body composed of members chosen by the people. Changes to its membership brought about by the voting public thus inflict no cognizable injury on the House.”

“It seems obvious that any group consisting of members who must work together to achieve the group’s aims has a keen interest in the identity of its members, and it follows that the group also has a strong interest in how its members are selected,” he wrote."
199,3,"When the laws on the books conflict with the better angels of modern society, they must be changed.

The State Legislature has the chance to update the law in two such areas before the session ends next week.

The first involves the so-called “gay panic” legal defense. In cases across the country, some of those accused of killing LGBTQ individuals have tried to bolster defenses and reduce sentences by blaming their violent acts on a reaction to the victim’s sexual orientation or gender identity.

Did the victim blow a kiss the defendant’s way? Was the defendant just surprised to learn that the victim was transgender? This is now a legitimate justification in court.

The American Bar Association in 2013 called for these defenses to be legislated away. Getting rid of them won’t leave those accused of crimes defenseless. And even if these defenses aren’t frequently successful, they are embarrassing.

The second area where the legislature must right a wrong involves sexual harassment. Currently, the New York Human Rights Law has been interpreted using a “severe or pervasive” standard for sexual harassment claims. Crude acts like unwanted touching in private areas that occur occasionally are just as revolting as ones that happen all the time. They should be actionable.

That much is clear in the wake of astonishing testimony during a February Albany hearing from women who described acts of harassment by government officials.

New York City has a more generous standard: someone treated less well due to gender and subjected to more than “petty slights or trivial inconveniences.”

Frivolous complaints shouldn’t be encouraged but requiring sexual harassment to be “severe or pervasive” in order to win a claim is wrong.

Times have changed. The law must, too."

To understand what is unfolding, one must understand the history of this awful saying. One must also understand that we, as ethnic minorities, consider ourselves to be co-equal citizens in this fantastic country we call America. In other words, there is no place to go back to. This is my country—the one that I love.

When President Donald Trump said four members of Congress should “go back” to the “places from which they came,” he was wrong, and he shouldn’t have said it.

His words conjured up unpleasant memories for so many black people like me and immigrants alike who have been targets of the “go back to your country” taunt throughout their lives. His words hurt people beyond the congresswomen he intended to condemn.

I won’t offer an excuse for his ill-worded tweets, but simply some perspective as someone who has met with the president and whose organization works with his administration daily.

The president loves this country, believes in the goodness of this country, and defends this country when others attack it. His tweets and follow-on comments were unacceptable, but let’s also be honest enough to recognize the destructive and divisive nature of the rhetoric of the members of Congress in question.

I can understand why Americans are tired of the growing chorus of anti-American sentiment from “The Squad.” We all can certainly have honest disagreements with how the country is being run—that’s one of the wonderful features of the American system—but to regularly trash it, its people, and those who protect it is another thing entirely.

I have found their rhetoric to be hateful, destructive, and dangerous. I will continue to expose their hypocrisy. What I will not do is join them in their ad hominem attacks as we debate policy.

As a woman and as a black person who lived through segregation, I know from personal experience about some of our nation’s shortcomings.

Despite these challenges, America was founded on a set of principles that have allowed us to rectify our wrongs, and in the process, build a freer and more prosperous nation where anyone has the opportunity to succeed.

One thing this whole incident can provide is the opportunity for discussion, education, and some level of understanding among the races about where insults like this and others originated, how they have been historically used to taunt and jeer, and why they still cause pain today.

I don’t think the president meant to tap into that pain, but he did.

When faced with a situation like this, we always have the choice to try to understand each other better or to become more divided. In my life, I’ve always sought to push toward more understanding.

The resolution in the House condemning the president is just the opposite. The intent is clear: It’s simply more partisan politics that is meant to divide us rather than unite us.

Our political discourse must be better, and politicians on both sides must do better. One of the unique characteristics about America is our freedom to disagree and challenge each other, but civility is needed, or else it all breaks apart.

We have a responsibility to demonstrate to the rest of the world what it looks like to live in a pluralistic society. That responsibility is not only to ourselves and to the world, but to our children who will inherit this country and become its next generation of leaders."

Both Sanders and Stein have refused to directly address any of the claims that they may have unwittingly (stress mine - I don't want people accusing me of claiming they were part of some conspiracy) helped the Russians defeat Hillary Clinton and elect Donald Trump.

This will come across as blasphemous to some, but I have come to accept that FDR isn't the knight in shining armor that I once considered him to be. This realization didn't come out of nowhere, but instead after countless hours of research and soul searching.

It's true that FDR helped guide the American people out of the worst economic downturn in a generation, but it's also true that he injected steroids into Jim Crow laws in the south *and* the north. In the south, racism was blatant; in the north racism was economic. In that respect, FDR failed miserably and signed multiple pieces of legislation into law that created the bedrock of the institutionalized racism we are still grappling with to this day.

The National Housing Act of 1934, which FDR signed into law, gave permission to the Home Owners' Loan Corporation to create ""residential security maps,"" which were used to single out minority neighborhoods from receiving any federal funding. These minority neighborhoods were literally outlined in red and allowed banks to deny all mortgage capital to people living within them.

""It takes many people by surprise. This whole history has been forgotten. It used to be well-known. There was nothing hidden about it. The federal government pursued two important policies in the mid-20th century that segregated metropolitan areas. One was the first civilian public housing program which frequently demolished integrated neighborhoods in order to create segregated public housing. The second program that the federal government pursued was to subsidize the development of suburbs on a condition that they be only sold to white families and that the homes in those suburbs had deeds that prohibited resale to African-Americans. These two policies worked together to segregate metropolitan areas in ways that they otherwise would never have been segregated.""

So FDR signed legislation into law that ""demolished integrated neighborhoods in order to create segregated public housing"" *and* used federal dollars to develop suburbs ""on a condition that they be only sold to white families.""

I fully understand that many people will retort with ""he was simply doing the best he could during the times he was living in,"" but I just don't buy that. He picked winners and losers and the losers are still grappling with the housing choices he made nearly a century ago.

I also fully understand that many people will vehemently disagree with my having the audacity to criticize a man countless Democrats look to as a hero and I am ok with that. I don't idolize anyone. It's important for us to understand history and why decisions made decades ago are still negatively affecting the lives of millions of people of color to this day.

We can dig our heads in the sand and act like none of that ever happened, or we can learn from it. I understand many people will continue to dig their heads in the sand, but I'm choosing to learn from it."
208,5,"Former Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens has died, ABC News first reported Tuesday. He was 99.

The big picture: Stevens was the 3rd-longest-serving member of the Supreme Court before he retired in 2010, per NBC News. After being appointed to the court by President Ford in 1975, he went on to have an impact on almost every area of the law, writing the court’s opinions in several landmark cases, the Washington Post notes.

After starting out as a moderate conservative, Stevens went on to become a leader of the court's liberal wing. He acted to limit the death penalty, establish gay rights, promote racial equality, preserve legal abortion and protect the rights of undocumented immigrants facing deportation, per AP.
• Stevens told the New York Times in 2007, ""I don’t think of myself as a liberal at all. I think as part of my general politics, I’m pretty darn conservative.""

During his retirement, Stevens remained an active voice on big issues. In October last year, Stevens said Brett Kavanaugh should not be appointed to the Supreme Court because of his performance at Senate confirmation hearings.

In his 2019 autobiography, ""'The Making of a Justice,"" Stevens addresses notable landmark cases the Supreme Court dealt with when he was on the bench — including Bush v. Gore, which led to former President George W. Bush winning the 2000 election.
• In the book, he writes he was confident while watching the Florida recount that the incident wouldn't end up in the Supreme Court, because ""the Constitution, after all, expressly delegates the 'time, place, and manner' of elections to the states,"" according to an excerpt of the book in the Seattle Times.
• He was shocked when a majority of the court intervened to stay the Florida recount — a ruling he dissented. (Stevens dissented from the court's rulings more frequently than any other justice during his tenure, NPR notes.)

Since the right wing has effectively shut down most important research, that could help many disabilities, or cure diseases, because the GOP openly objects to any stem cell research

 which is often obtained from ""fetuses."" NOW we potentially have a New Source for ""stem cells.""

 

 In August 2008, it was revealed that scientists in Japan were able to successfully harvest stem cells from wisdom teeth. This discovery is of great clinical importance, as wisdom tooth extractions are a relatively common type of oral surgery. Patients who have their wisdom teeth removed are currently able to opt to have stem cells from those teeth isolated and saved, in case they should ever need the cells. [one potential use is to restore breast tissue after removal of a cancerous tumor]. Many others are being discovered."

211,5,"Here’s the news as told by The New York Times:

John Paul Stevens, whose 35 years on the United States Supreme Court transformed him, improbably, from a Republican antitrust lawyer to the outspoken leader of the court’s liberal wing, died Tuesday at a hospital in Fort Lauderdale, Fla. He was 99.

The cause was complications from a stroke he suffered the day before, the Supreme Court announced in a statement.

When he retired in 2010 at the age of 90, Justice Stevens was the second-oldest and the second-longest-serving justice ever to sit on the court. Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr. was about eight months older when he retired in 1932, and William O. Douglas had served 36 years (1939-75).

Justice Stevens had spent much of his service on the court in the shadow of more readily definable colleagues when he emerged as a central figure during a crucial period of the court’s history: The last phase of Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist’s tenure and the early years under Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr."

But when your own Mother says ""If you don't like that what I do for three hours a night makes you boiling mad then you can just get the hell out of here!"" after weeks of rational attempts to solve the issue then how would you feel?

And her only sentence is ""I have my conservative values.""

She has not realized or accepted that this is not conservatism. She has been conned and it made me irate and disgusted to watch, for three hours a night, and every morning, and at lunch.

My values are not underage rape, sexual harassment, groping women for 50 years, bullying, lying, cheating, fraud, fake businesses, wire fraud, bank fraud, 45 years of racist real estate practices, utilizing racism to win votes and keep you out of prison, etc. And that's about 1/10th of it.

Just because people refuse to accept facts does not mean they do not exist.

So makes it very hard to deal with them. I have strong values. I was raised right. Which makes it twice as hard to watch her try to remain in the year 1955.

I can explain all of this in vast detail. How it all happened, the history, minute details of every single thing that has happened over the past three years, or 20.

That is just a fact.

So it is very difficult to deal with cult members. Funny thing is this has all been done intentionally, for this very reason.

If those are my Mother's values then I want no part of it. But it is sad because she has literally no clue what is true or what is fiction, and is not interested in finding out. A cult.

Have a good night! Still love you! :) :) :)

It's okay. Life is complicated sometimes."

217,5,"President Trump has on numerous occasions expressed that without borders we do not have a country. Historically and scripturally he is right.

The leftist would have you believe a narrative convenient to their open border assertion: That we've welcomed with open arms anyone fleeing countries with a story to evoke sympathy and compassion and that it is an imperative from God Almighty that we do so. Both assertions are blatantly false.

As Christians, our guide should first be God's word.

The Bible is filled with references to borders, walls, and nations. God divided the peoples into nations and established the borders. The Hebrew word ""chowmah"" appears over a hundred times in the Old Testament and refers to walls built for the protection of the area within.

Walls are depicted favorably when strong and broken walls designated the negative. Such a reference is even made regarding our spiritual state, “He that hath no rule over his own spirit is like a city that is broken down, and without walls,” Proverbs 25:28 (KJV).

Likewise, throughout the Old Testament, the differentiation between sojourners/legal travelers and foreigners/illegals is cited.

In Acts 17:26 (KJV) we are told God, ""...hath made of one blood all nations of men for to dwell on all the face of the earth, and hath determined the times before appointed, and the bounds of their habitation.""

In our fallen state, many people worldwide are not guided by the morality and values we choose. Thus, the government is instilled for our protection. Be it defense from the evils of deliberate physical aggression, or from the dangers to our health, well-being, and economy, a righteous government such as ours is to be obeyed, ""Let every soul be subject unto the higher powers. For there is no power but of God: the powers that be are ordained of God. Whosoever therefore resisteth the power, resisteth the ordinance of God: and they that resist shall receive to themselves damnation,"" Romans 13:1-2 (KJV).

It follows then that the law established (unless in direct violation of God) should be respected and obeyed. For a government not to protect its people is in direct opposition to God's will, likewise, those who would violate a wall of a sovereign entity are in opposition to God's will.

Nehemiah was led by God to rebuild the wall around Jerusalem and after its completion exclaimed, ""So the wall was finished...And it came to pass, that when all our enemies heard thereof, and all the heathen that were about us saw these things, they were much cast down in their own eyes: for they perceived that this work was wrought of our God,"" Nehemiah 6:16 (KJV).

We also have the example of another man of God, Moses, despite needing to traverse land, obeying and not crossing when permission was denied. In Numbers 20 we learn that Moses sent messengers to plead with the king of Edom that they would be allowed to simply cross his country's land, saying ""...behold, we are in Kadesh, a city in the uttermost of thy border: Let us pass, I pray thee, through thy country: we will not pass through the fields, or through the vineyards, neither will we drink of the water of the wells: we will go by the king's high way, we will not turn to the right hand nor to the left, until we have passed thy borders. And Edom said unto him, Thou shalt not pass by me, lest I come out against thee with the sword,"" Numbers 20: 17-18 (KJV).

Did Moses trespass? No. However, he did implore once more for permission, ""We will go by the high way: and if I and my cattle drink of thy water, then I will pay for it: I will only, without doing anything else, go through on my feet. And he said, Thou shalt not go through. And Edom came out against him with much people, and with a strong hand. Thus Edom refused to give Israel passage through his border..."" Numbers 20-19-21 (KJV).

At this second denial, Moses made his journey through another route. He did not ignore the nation's laws nor did God tell him to ignore it and break the law by trespassing. He respected the border despite his personal situation.

The United States has long welcomed immigrants; we've been the most welcoming nation and the most sought after nation people worldwide want to enter. It's part of our history and tradition to welcome those seeking a better life in the land of opportunity. But it's never been open borders and for good cause.

The United States has a history of selecting and vetting who enters our country and who is denied. A clear example of the Biblical mandate as to why governments exist is the protection of a nation's citizens from those who may bring harm.

The checkpoint at Ellis Island, for example, did this by admitting people legally who met the criteria both financially to support themselves and were free of certain diseases. Even without the current welfare burden placed on taxpayers, those without proof of financial stability were turned away. The relative ease of entering the United States, including at our southern border, later changed due to the best interests of the United States.

It is always a nation's rightful prerogative to determine who enters, for what reason, and who cannot. Various type immigration acts did this over the years in our country changing depending upon the needs of the nation.

To challenge the wisdom and will of God, who created the nations and their respective borders, in favor of open (essentially no) borders is to defy His will as well as the historic precedence of controlling who enters our country. Open borders (be it through slack immigration laws, tolerated misuse of the legal means or borders being neglected and unenforced) is to sow the wind and reap the whirlwind of all manner of destruction.

There is no compassion in encouraging people, ignorant and desperate, to forge forward to illegally enter a country. It's wrong. Such sentiment and actions result in rampant needless suffering en-route and once detained due to the sheer numbers overloading this nation's resources directed for it.

The contemporary immigration disaster is tragic and due to incompetence and disregard of what is right for the American people by the legislature. Those seeking entry to our country should be met with the rule of law, as it is the rule of law responsible for creating the wealth and security such foreigners at best are seeking as they flee countries void of both.

Compassion would be taking actions to affect the people's home countries and their governments or establishing places of refuge in churches in countries which give permission for the foreigners to stay. Forcing the American taxpayer to foot the bill for such immense welfare is an evil perpetrated by the left against the core principles of this nation and against the will of God as given by Scripture.

Every nation has the moral obligation and right to choose who enters its borders and who may reside there."

220,5,"News from the legal front is not good for Donald Trump or anyone who had anything to do with his 2016 inaugural committee.



 CNN is reporting that tens of thousands of documents have been turned over in response to a subpoena issued by the SDNY, and that means that prosecutors in that office are clearly on the verge of possibly issuing indictments in the case, which could prove catastrophic for First Lady Melania Trump:

“The end of the document production indicates the investigation is moving into the next stage. Authorities are investigating whether any of the record $107 million in donations for the inaugural was misspent, used to improperly benefit certain individuals, or came from foreign donors in violation of campaign finance laws that prohibit foreign money in US elections, people familiar with the inquiry said.”



 It also appears that one key figure from the Trump inaugural has already been interviewed by federal prosecutors:

Yes, the First Lady herself could be facing federal charges if it can be proven that she directed funds from the inaugural committee be steered to Wolkoff. That would be a direct violation of federal law and could result in charges of fraud being filed against the president’s wife.



 The inaugural committee investigation is a direct result of a recording obtained when federal officials raided the office and residences of President Trump’s personal attorney and fixer, Michael Cohen. The New York Attorney General is also believed to be investigating the inaugural since the Trump Organization is headquartered in the Empire State.

One name that keeps coming up is Imaad Zuberi, CNN notes. He was the only person singled out in the subpoena from the SDNY:

It’s becoming clearer by the day that the Russia investigation was just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to Trump’s legal problems. Considering that he’s allegedly committed endless crimes over the years, there’s certainly no shortage of evidence."
221,5,"Six million disenfranchised citizens; voter identification laws that disproportionally affect minorities and the poor; moving polling stations, reducing early voting days, and canceling Sunday voting altogether. Welcome to the Jim Crow of the 21st Century. It's less sexy than the racist laws of the 20th Century, but it's just as dangerous.We need to revisit our past to understand how we got here. Jim Crow laws came about after the north basically gave up on reconstruction and left the south to fend for itself. The utter failure of reconstruction allowed the same individuals who fought for the Confederacy to take charge and enact brutally racist laws designed to terrorize and disenfranchise the newly freed blacks of the south.This hell on earth lasted nearly one hundred years until the civil rights movement which began in earnest during the mid-20th Century. Jim Crow laws were eventually thrown out with the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibited disenfranchisement based on race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.Not surprisingly, those who wanted to reverse these gains had to think of new ways to make it hard for minorities to vote. What better way to do that then declare a 'War on Drugs' and start imprisoning millions of citizens for nonviolent offenses? Who do we have to thank for this 'war' that has imprisoned and disenfranchised millions of Americans? Every conservatives hero, Ronald Reagan.America's prison population exploded during Reagan's tenure and continued to rapidly rise for the next thirty years. This war was deliberately directed towards America's minority population, as anyone who studies the numbers can attest to. Crack cocaine would get you locked up for one hundred times longer than powder cocaine. Seriously, 100:1. The Fair Sentencing Act of 2010 changed that ratio to 18:1, which still doesn't make much sense considering it's the same drug! Not just that, but study after study shows that black Americans sentences are disproportionally longer than those of whites.Eleven states currently have laws that can strip voting rights of convicted felons for the rest of their lives. Another twenty states strip voting rights during a prisoners incarceration, parole, and probation, which can sometimes last the rest of their lives. Four states strip voting rights during a prisoners incarceration and parole. And thirteen states plus Washington D.C. restrict voting rights during a prisoners incarceration. Only two out of fifty states allow prisoners to vote while they are in prison. This has to change and change now.Voting is a fundamental right in this country. It is time for Democrats and liberals to stand up and demand this change. President Obama and Attorney General Holder have tried to get this conversation started, but they need us to stand with them. It is my belief that every legal citizen in this country should have the right to vote. If you stand with me then contact the Attorney General and the Senate and House Judiciary Committee's. We need to convince our leaders that this is the top Civil Rights issue of the 21st Century."
222,5,"Now is the time to canvass and win key races in an area right next door to us. 



As you well know, activists must be careful about where and how they spend their time and energy. With so many fights at so many levels of government happening at once, and so many strategies and tactics to choose from, bandwidth and effectiveness are more essential considerations than ever in deciding how progressive activists should use their resources.



This is a fight worth fighting, and spending time here is worth it.



(If you’re thinking “You had me at the headline dude. I don’t need to hear the rest of this!” click here to see canvassing opportunities).



The Pearland ISD Elections are in May. That’s just as massive block walks kick off for Houston City Council. 2020 Election campaigns haven’t even taken shape yet.



Between now and May is a gap when those who primarily focus on electoral politics as a mechanism for change have a gap in their election schedules. Even if you are not focused first and foremost on electoral politics, this is still a good time to flip these seats; candidates for later elections will be hitting events in higher volume later on, leaving plenty of time to birddog for later date.



The Texas legislature is still massively important, and deserves some attention, as do plenty of issues at the county and federal level, but now is a time when the electoral calendar has just enough of a gap for us to get out and spend extra resources in Pearland.



2) These are the wins we need most.

Local victories grant elected progressives outsized control and influence over policy. As the old adage goes, the closer someone’s front door is to your front door, the more influence they have over your life. Winning local elections has a massive, immediate impact on the lives of those in the community, and will massively impact the lives of parents, teachers, and students in the school district. 



Local electoral victories also build up a bench; the victors in these races may be able to move on to higher profile seats at a later time thanks to the name ID and electoral work they put in now. And thanks to the experience they will have gotten on the job, they will be prepared to govern well in those positions later on, too.



The more of these wins we can pick up in red areas, the better. Progressives- not just Democrats, but people with progressive values- winning in areas where they “weren’t supposed to win” changes the entire investment calculus of fundraisers and organizations around the nation. Progressive progress in an area like Pearland may mean more money in Texas for 2020 elections, or more investment in rural and red suburban areas by state bundlers. We can’t just win where progressivism is already popular. We have to expand the map.



Wins like these do just that.



3) Wins in red turf energize our base for future elections.

The other advantage of winning in these areas is the energy and the expansion of the movement that comes with victory. Suddenly, people see progressivism as viable. Closeted progressives come out of the woodwork. Progressives who have been fighting for years take on a new energy and gear up for the next fight with wind beneath their wings. And moderates and even conservatives who previously viewed progressivism as the boogeyman may even have the opportunity to see that the movement isn’t so bad, and may even start to consider some our values and ideas as our candidates take seats.



After all, everyone loves a winner.



Just as we want our side fired up and ready to fight, we want those who wish to quell civil rights to feel as though our victory is inevitable. While we would all prefer to persuade people over entirely and close the divide between progressivism and the opposition, some people aren’t persuadable (as many political consultants would attest).



People who have really ugly and hate-filled ideas may find their own energy in losing, but more often than not, taking what they assumed to be out of reach for we progressives will make them want to throw in the towel more than it makes them want to get up and fight. And should they want to get up and fight, that’s a good sign, too… it means we’re winning, right?



5) Winning three seats would officially flip control of the Pearland school board.

The Pearland ISD board is almost entirely Republican. The exception is Mike Floyd, who won his seat at 18 years old running principally on the issue of civil rights, particularly trans rights. Unfortunately for Mike, Pearland, and the progressive cause, the rest of the board votes 6-1 against progressive policies in many instances.



Winning three seats would give control of the school board to progressives. Instead of having one dissenting voice on the board, the center of gravity would lean left. The board presidency could later be taken by a progressive.



It’s simple math: three more votes means a majority that didn’t exist, and another local board flipped for our causes.



6) These candidates are worth fighting for.

Dona Murphey, Joseph Say, and Al Lloyd are running on a progressive slate and are worth fighting for. Backing them is not an alliance of convenience; these are candidates we can truly stand behind. Joseph (Former Executive Director of PSR Texas) and Dona (a doctor, parent, and Founder of PSR Texas) in particular have been active in the Houston community and fight for equity for all. They say what they mean, and the fact that they are choosing a local seat in their communities instead of trying to jump into something high profile only further speaks to their dedication to truly helping those around them instead of running for fame or glory. Al, an assistant principal at Bellaire High School, has dedicated his career to education and rounds out a very strong ticket with good credentials and values.



7) The hard right in Pearland has acted in particularly bad faith this election.

I’m not going to repeat or outline the extremist reputational hit jobs the hard right in Pearland has tried to level at the progressive candidates in the race, but please believe me when I say that if you saw them you would want to work that much harder to make sure our candidates win. Incumbents on the Pearland ISD board should denounce the attacks on the character of our candidates and the lies that underlie those attacks, but in lieu of that, defeating them at the polls would be a fitting counter to their vile dishonesty.



This is a chance to conquest over the trolls in our own backyard. How can we pass that up?



8) The votes are there.

These races are winnable. The only question is whether or not we do what we need to do to emerge victorious. Pearland may look red, but there is ground to make up out there, and activists can make it up by engaging the community and outworking the opposition. 



Ground game is good for up to 5% in an election that can be measured. In other words, field work can make up five measurable percentage points in an election if it is running top notch. These points are measured by seeing which voters who were contacted went to the polls to vote.



Beyond that 5% ground game can also have numerous immeasurable impacts. When a canvasser introduces a candidate, the canvasser is usually the first impression that candidate is making on the voter. The first impression is hard to undo, and is likely to stick. In addition, people who are engaged by a candidate may be more likely to mention the candidate to others online, at the water cooler at work or other places. They may donate to the campaign or volunteer to knock doors themselves, or simply boost morale by bringing cookies to the campaign office.



The point is that canvassing matters and can change the outcome of elections. We saw that example in the case of Mike Floyd, who knocked tons of doors in Pearland in his race, and Elizabeth Santos, whose campaign team canvassed areas of HISD District I that had previously been overlooked. 



Ground game can make the difference here, too.



10) It’s all on us.

An unfortunate fact exposed by the current administration and the horror show happening at various levels of government is that elected officials, larger institutions, businesses, etc. are not going to save us from our problems. It’s sad but true. There is no cavalry, no deus ex machina, no Zeus on horseback, lightning bolt in hand to step in and save us.



The only ones who can truly make change in our communities is us.



I can think of noone braver, more courageous, or more worthy to make it happen.

Join the Pearland ISD Progressive slate for block walks now through election day on May 4th.

I will be walking as part of a MASSIVE 1000 Door Walk on April 7th.

You can see all future events and walks here."

224,5,"When he was asked about Jeffrey Epstein— who was accused of sexually assaulting numerous underage girls — in July of last year, President Donald Trump pretended he hadn’t had contact with Epstein in years, commenting:

What kind of falling out? Trump didn’t specify, but he was clearly trying to put as much distance between himself and Epstein, who allegedly committed suicide by hanging himself while in federal custody awaiting trial.



 As it turns out, the “falling out” that took place 15 years ago just so happens to coincide with when a woman says Epstein and Trump raped her. She was 13 at the time. And she sued Trump in 2016, PBS reports:

“Jane Doe” aka “Katie Johnson” – 1994. Lawsuit filed June 2016, refiled October 2016 as reported by Buzzfeed and others, then dropped in November 2016.

 Jane Doe is an unnamed plaintiff, who has also gone by “Katie Johnson” in legal papers. She claims she was repeatedly raped by Trump and Jeffery Epstein at Epstein’s New York City apartment in 1994, when she was 13 years old. A witness, also given a pseudonym — “Tiffany Doe” — said she recruited “Jane Doe” and others. Doe, using the name “Johnson,” gave an interview to the Daily Mail in which she said she did not know who Trump was at the time of the alleged attack but identified him later when she saw him on television. It is not known why she withdrew the lawsuit. She has not spoken publicly or withdrawn her rape allegation since then.



 In that filing, there’s this horrific description of what allegedly transpired between Trump and Epstein as they argued over which one of them would be the first to rape the girl:

“Shortly after this sexual assault by the Defendant, Jeffrey E. Epstein, on the Plaintiff, Katie Johnson, Plaintiff Johnson was still present while the two Defendants were arguing over who would be the one to take Plaintiff Johnson’s virginity. The Defendant, Donald J. Trump, was clearly heard referring to Defendant, Jeffrey E. Epstein, as a ‘Jew Bastard’ as he yelled at Defendant Epstein that clearly, he, Defendant Trump, should be the lucky one to ‘pop the cherry’ of Plaintiff Johnson.”



 If indeed Trump was present when the 13-year-old was raped — even if he didn’t participate in the act — he’s still an accomplice to a felony. If that’s not a “high crime and misdemeanor” as called for to impeach a president, then nothing is.

Donald Trump is a disgusting scumbag. He needs to be impeached or voted out of office. And the minute he leaves the White House, he needs to be arrested, indicted, and prosecuted."
226,5,"Fish die-offs in Wisconsin lakes are expected to double by mid-century and quadruple by 2100 due to warmer summer temperatures, according to a study published Monday in the journal Nature Climate Change.

To better understand how fish die-offs are changing, researchers from Reed College and UC Davis analyzed a database of freshwater fish die-offs in Wisconsin combined with lake temperature data and simulations. They found that more than 100 of 500 fish die-offs recorded between 2004 and 2014 in the state were strongly linked with heat waves and warmer average surface water temperatures.

“This research takes a substantial step forward in connecting the dots between the occurrence of rare ecological catastrophes and climate warming,” said lead author Samuel Fey, a mass mortality specialist and assistant professor at Reed College in Portland, Oregon. “Historically, the causes of animal die-offs have been difficult to study because these events tend to be rare and unpredictable.”

Summertime die-off events occurred in lakes that were warmer than lakes without die-offs, and during years of particularly high water temperatures.

The scientists used climate projections to forecast fish die-offs driven by warming summer temperatures over the coming decades. Their results indicate a sobering future for common species such as bluegill, walleye, largemouth bass and northern pike that inhabit these lakes. In the modeling, significant numbers of fish die-offs occurred with an increase of just 2 degrees Celsius, which the globe is on track to surpass by 2100.

“This study is unveiling another reality of what climate change will look like for north-temperate lakes across the world,” said co-author Andrew Rypel, an associate professor at UCD and the Peter B. Moyle and California Trout Chairman in Coldwater Fish Ecology. “Analyses provide an up-close view of how fish populations will die, and how species will die due to climate change. It’s particularly problematic for freshwater fishes in landlocked lakes, as they don’t have the ability to adapt to changing climates by migrating. Effects have to be dealt with by managers right where they are.”

The historic and predicted future distribution of summer fish-kill events in Wisconsin lakes. (a) reported summer kills from 2004-2013, (b) projections for die-offs by 2059, and (c) projections for 2100. (Nature Climate Change)

The study shows most future fish kills are expected to occur in the southern portion of the state, which is the warmest and most populated part of Wisconsin. Urban, agricultural and industrial activities combine to impact lakes in the area.

Rypel says this presents a problem for fish but also opportunities for their management, adaptation and resilience. Cities, communities and resource managers could take measures to improve lake conditions through heightened efforts to manage phosphorous loads and restore forests around riparian areas to act as a sponge for contaminants that could otherwise enter the lake."
227,5,"Huron, Ohio is“A Great Lake Place,” a small town with a handful of stop-lights, situated on the picturesque shores of Lake Erie. But a recent development in its real estate has some residents concerned about the future of the city’s family-friendly atmosphere. Last month, News5Cleveland reported that Ohio Patients’ Choice, which has already begun construction on a large cultivation site in the town, plans to invest $2 million into a medical marijuana dispensary located on a main community intersection. The site, formerly host to the local Burger King, has a contract pending the approval of OPC’s licensure approval with The State Board of Pharmacy.

The local community, including long-time teacher and football coach, Tony Legando, are surprised at the lack of communication concerning the city’s plans to allow the dispensary; especially since it will be prominently located at an intersection that serves as an elementary school entry.“I’m not sure that anybody really thought that this is the entrance for the drop-off and pick-up zone for the kids at our intermediate school,” Legando told .Sarah Phinney of News5Cleveland,“We should be getting a lot of communication about this. That just hasn’t been the case and that’s concerning me.”

The dispensary, pending licensure approval, will sit on the intersection of Cleveland Rd. and Lake Erie Parkway. Though the proposed dispensary site meets the minimum distance from a school of 500 feet as required by Ohio law, the largest elementary school in the city of Huron sits just outside of that legal distance. Every parent and bus driver is currently required to drive right by the possible future site of a marijuana dispensary. “Parents dropping off or picking up intermediate school students should do so from Lake Erie Parkway,” states the school’s newsletter,“After dropping off or picking up your student please continue to follow Lake Erie Parkway back out to Cleveland Rd.”

The opportunism for crime at an all-cash dispensary is also a concern. Even thoughlegislationhas passed to address this problem, the funding to establish it has yet to materialize. The Arizona Daily Sun reported that dispensaries are cash-only, “as marijuana remains listed as a Schedule 1 drug under federal law- putting it in the same category as heroin, LSD and Ecstasy.”

Jeff Grabmeier of The Ohio State University reported on a three-year study in Denver published in the Journal of Primary Prevention: “Researchers found that crime isn’t higher in the area immediately surrounding marijuana outlets. But adjacent areas saw about 84 more property crimes per year than neighborhoods without a nearby marijuana store.” In the small community of Huron, many kids walk or ride their bikes to such neighborhoods. Lead Author of the study, Bridge Freisthler, is a professor of social work at The Ohio State University. She stated in the article:“If you’re doing strictly from a public health standpoint, there is reason to be somewhat concerned about having a marijuana outlet near your home.” In their study, they found that when Colorado’s laws made recreational marijuana legal, “only those dispensaries that already were selling for medical purposes were allowed to apply for a license to sell recreational marijuana.”

News5Cleveland also reported that “The State Board of Pharmacy may award up to 60 dispensary licenses in the spring.” Two dispensaries will be awarded licenses within the four counties where Huron sits. One city within those counties has already rallied together in order to prevent medical marijuana from being processed or sold.

On November 7, 2017, Mansfield City Council members voted 6-1 to ban medical marijuana sales. Law director John Spon, explained, “We have enough addictions in our society, and we don’t need it. We can build industry based upon other facets that don’t add to the social ills or our society.” TheMansfield Police Chief also stated, “We're a community of children and families, and at some point, revenue doesn't matter as much as maintaining the security and sanctity of your community and of your families,"" he said. ""There's other ways to make money.”

Other communities are following suit, leaving some Huron residents hopeful that their community will do the same. In January 2018, after the state had already granted a cultivation license to applicant Paragon for a site in their city, Huber Heights City Council also approved a permanent ban on medical marijuana processors, cultivators, and dispensaries.

Calaveras County, California, home to legal medical marijuana for two decades, has recently reversed its stance, even though the industry generated over $7 million in tax revenue in 2016 alone. Two hundred farmers with permits were given three months to shut down operations.

Medical marijuana has been legal in Arizona since 2010. In the same state, the opioid death rate has increasednearly 75 percent since the legalization. Harvard Health Publishing states the most common use for medical marijuana in the Unites States is pain control, and that at least several million Americans currently use it.

The Ohio Medical Marijuana Control Program states on its website that, “The State of Ohio Board of Pharmacy are required by law to take all actions necessary to ensure that Ohio’s Medical Marijuana Control Program is fully operational no later than September 2018.”

What does that mean for communities like Huron, Ohio?

Local concerned parents can attend the Huron City School Board Meeting on Monday, February 5 at 5:30pm.

Focused advocacy by the Yuba Community College District Governing Board was conducted during the 2019 Legislative Session, requesting the Governor consider including the Woodland Community College Performing Arts/Culinary capital project in the 2019-2020 state budget to fulfill a long-awaited promise to the local voters of the Yuba Community College District.

The project will provide for a new facility to consolidate and expand space for the college’s Performing, Fine Arts and Speech programs while creating space for the new Culinary Arts program.

The proposed new building will consist of 29,118 square feet with a variety of classrooms, laboratories, office space, and a new performing arts theater.

The facility is estimated to cost a total of $42 million with the state matching $18.87 million of the total cost of the building.

Chancellor Dr. Douglas Houston stated, “On behalf of the YCCD Governing Board, I want to express my appreciation to the Governor and the California Legislature for approving the state matching funds so that we can construct this critical WCC facility. This construction project enables us to keep a commitment to voters and will serve the students of Yolo, Colusa and Lake Counties for future generations.”

The Woodland Community College Performing Arts/Culinary capital project was included in the Measure J General Obligation Bond project list approved by voters in 2006 and has been included on the California Community College Board of Governor’s approved project list since it was submitted in 2009.

WCC President Dr. Art Pimentel added, “These are exciting times for our college. The new facility will allow us to optimize our students’ academic experience. The new building will enable us to offer additional programs in culinary arts as well as increase the variety of courses we offer in the visual and performing arts. We are grateful to the voters for continuing to support the long term vision of a comprehensive community college that provides exciting and dynamic academic programs for our student body.”"
230,5,"The appalling conditions at a Border Patrol facility near El Paso Texas — conditions that have led to apt comparisons to concentration camps as defined by any dictionary — were exposed by the Associated Press yesterday after attorneys attempting to help the refugee children came to the news organization with horrifying tales of “neglect and mistreatment at the hands of the U.S. government.”

The lawyers had interviewed 60 out of the 250 infants, children and teens being held at the facility in Clint, Texas and described what they discovered to the AP.

“…there were three infants in the station, all with their teen mothers, along with a 1-year-old, two 2-year-olds and a 3-year-old. There are dozens more under 12. Fifteen have the flu, and 10 more are quarantined,” the news organization reported “Three girls told attorneys they were trying to take care of the 2-year-old boy, who had wet his pants and had no diaper and was wearing a mucus-smeared shirt when the legal team encountered him,” the report continued. “’A Border Patrol agent came in our room with a 2-year-old boy and asked us, “Who wants to take care of this little boy?” Another girl said she would take care of him, but she lost interest after a few hours and so I started taking care of him yesterday,’ one of the girls said in an interview with attorneys.”

Warren Binford, a law professor who is assisting in the interviews with the captive children, described the extremely young detainees as “so tired they have been falling asleep on chairs and at the conference table.”

Holly Cooper, the co-director of the University of California, Davis’ Immigration Law Clinic, represents incarcerated children and told the AP that “in my 22 years of doing visits with children in detention, I have never heard of this level of inhumanity.”

The lawyers were interviewing the children after negotiating access with Border Patrol officials who knew of their visit several weeks in advance. According to government regulations, unaccompanied minors are only allowed to be held by Border Patrol for up to 72 hours before being transferred to facilities run by the Department of Health and Human Services.

The Trump administration’s crackdown on immigration, however, has led to severe overcrowding at both the Border Patrol and HHS facilities.

Acting Customs and Border Protection Commissioner John Sanders told the AP that his agency is currently holding 15,000 people, while their capacity is only 4,000 people. He pleaded with Congress to pass a pending $4.6 billion emergency funding package —including nearly $3 billion to care for unaccompanied refugee children.

The co-chair of the American Academy of Pediatrics Immigrant Health Special Interest Group, Dr. Julie Linton, said that the Border Patrol stations are completely inappropriate places to hold children.

The AP also quoted Gilbert Kliman, a San Francisco psychoanalyst who has evaluated about 50 asylum seekers, about the lasting psychological damage that the trauma of their detention is causing the children in custody.

While Republicans in Congress continue to play semantic games by objecting to Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s (D-NY) description of the nation’s overflowing immigrant detention centers as “concentration camps,” anyone with a brain and a dictionary can see how apt the totalitarian nomenclature is.

Things will only change if enough people stand up and say “enough!”

The Trump administration must be removed from office, and its white nationalist policies repudiated and reversed as soon as possible.

These words by the Attorney General should send shockwaves through America.

American citizens – and even possibly a political campaign – were spied on, and the only question is whether it was “adequately predicated.” In other words, was proper procedure followed, or was there rampant political bias and Deep State abuse of our legal system?

We’ve long warned of FISA (Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act) abuses by the Deep State bureaucracy. We’ve been fully engaged in multiple federal court cases – uncovering numerous abuses and political bias at the top levels of the FBI, DOJ, and other senior officials from the Obama Administration.

Now there are two investigations into the spying on American citizens and potential politically biased abuse of power by the Deep State. An Inspector General’s report is due soon, and the Attorney General just announced that he is investigating the “spying” as well.

At the ACLJ, we’re urging a full and thorough investigation of these Deep State abuses. Take action with us.

232,5,"On May 30th, President Trump signed a monumental bill into law that fundamentally changes the treatment process for those with terminal illnesses. The Right To Try Act will allow patients who are terminally ill to try experimental treatments without government intervention after all other options have been exhausted. However, the patient first needs approval from their doctor and the drug manufacturer. Before this law, a patient was required to apply to the FDA for ""compassionate use"" of an experimental treatment, in hopes of being allowed to have the opportunity to save their life.

Critics of the legislation have noted that the bill undermines the role of the FDA to screen harmful drugs from reaching the general public. However, as FDA commissioner Scott Gottlieb had stated, the FDA already approves 99 percent of cases when people apply for experimental treatment. Other critics have argued that the bill gives patients ""false hope,""since pharmaceutical companies are not required to approve the patients' use of the experimental drugs. However, the FDA website statesthat the FDA cannot force a pharmaceutical company to provide an experimental drug and that a company reserves the right to turn down a request from the FDA for a compassionate use treatment.

Proponents of the new bill argue that it provides a faster, more efficient means for patients to receive the treatment that could save their lives, as in the case of 83-year-old Bob Gadshall, a 20 year member of the Pennsylvania State Legislature who is a success story of the saving potentiality of experimental treatments. The Right To Try act can be read here at the official website of the US Congress.On May 30th, President Trump signed a monumental billinto law that fundamentally changes the treatment process for those with terminal illnesses.

233,5,"President Donald Trump’s tweets about Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and other minority congresswomen, in which he called for them to “go back and help fix the totally broken and crime infested places from which they came,” will remain on Twitter amid the controversy they have caused.

Twitter won’t be removing them because it determined they don’t violate its terms of service, although the company said Monday — during which the hashtag #RacistPresident was among the top trending topics — it would have no comment about the matter.

Neither has Twitter applied a label to Trump’s tweets under its new policy, announced last month, which would add a disclaimer to political leaders’ tweets that the company deems to have violated its rules. Twitter’s rules include no attacks on others “on the basis of race, ethnicity, national origin, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, religious affiliation, age, disability, or serious disease.”

Twitter has yet to label any tweets under its new policy, which also is supposed to downgrade the visibility of the tweets.

Twitter has rarely taken action against Trump, who has 61.9 million followers on the @realDonaldTrump account he has had since before he became president, despite many calls to rein him in or even ban him because of his tweets. He has attacked minorities, women, individuals including former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, Sen. Elizabeth Warren and former President Barack Obama — and many others — on Twitter. The San Francisco-based company has said multiple times that the president’s tweets are newsworthy, although in 2017 it did remove a couple of his retweets amid a crackdown on some far-right accounts.

“What they’ve said is that they’re going to keep his tweets up and they will exempt him from their standards because of ‘public interest’,” said Malkia Cyril, founder and executive director of Center for Media Justice, an Oakland-based media and civil rights advocacy group, in an interview Monday. “But public interest also includes holding officials accountable. There’s nothing holding the president accountable.”

“Trump’s consistent targeting and abuse of women of color in congress is not only vulgar, reckless and shameful — it’s flat out dangerous,” said Brandi Collins-Dexter, senior campaign director for Color of Change, another civil rights advocacy group founded in Oakland. “Twitter choosing not even to label his content what it is, is just more proof they can’t be serious about fixing a problem of their own making.”

Trump on Sunday targeted the Democratic U.S. congresswomen with a tweet thread that did not specify their names, but it was understood that he was talking about Ocasio-Cortez, who hails from the Bronx in New York and is of Puerto Rican descent, Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts and Rashida Tlaib of Michigan, who were all born in the United States, plus Rep. Rep. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, who was born in Somalia but became a U.S. citizen in 2000 when she was a teenager. The four have been clashing with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-San Francisco, and Trump exploited that rift.

Monday, the president doubled down and said the four congresswomen have themselves been guilty of “(spewing) racist hatred,” and suggested that they apologize to him.

Pelosi slammed Trump’s tweets as “xenophobic” and on Monday backed a resolution in the House to condemn his statements. She noted in a letter to House Democrats that a resolution is coming and that it will be “sponsored by Congressman Tom Malinowski, who was born abroad, and Congressman Jamie Raskin, along with other Democratic Members born abroad.”

Some Republican lawmakers have also criticized the president’s statements, with Rep. Will Hurd of Texas, the only black Republican member of the House, saying the “tweets are racist and xenophobic.”

Ocasio-Cortez tweeted Monday: “It’s important to note that the President’s words (yesterday), telling four American Congresswomen of color ‘go back to your own country,’ is hallmark language of white supremacists. Trump feels comfortable leading the GOP into outright racism, and that should concern all Americans.”

Tlaib addressed Trump in a tweet Sunday: “Detroit taught me how to fight for the communities you continue to degrade & attack.”

Ocasio-Cortez did the same on Twitter: “THIS is what racism looks like. WE are what democracy looks like. And we’re not going anywhere.”

And Oman’s tweet: “Mr. President, As Members of Congress, the only country we swear an oath to is the United States. Which is why we are fighting to protect it from the worst, most corrupt and inept president we have ever seen.”"

A teenage girl has died after her uncle allegedly threw her from an 11th floor apartment in Iran.

Fatemeh Ghozat, 16, was allegedly beaten and then murdered by her uncle Mojtaba Namdar after speaking out against his abuse on May 22.

The alleged incident took place in the Shahrah-e Aseman neighbourhood of Parand in southeast Tehran.

The victim’s mother is now speaking out after Namdar was released on bail just two weeks after the incident, Iran International TV reported.

Speaking to Iran International TV, Bariha Rahmani said: ‘He threw my girl out of the window in front of my eyes, and then placed her body in my hands.

‘He has now been released on bail and walks free. He threatens my son, and tells him, “It’s your turn now!”.

‘I’m afraid for myself and my children.

‘Tell me, in what other country in the world, when a murder has occurred and all the evidence points to the fact it was murder, would the accused be released on bail two weeks later?’

Relatives insist that Mojtaba Namdar confessed to killing Fatemeh in front of all their neighbours before emergency services arrived at the crime scene.

However, after the girl was pronounced dead, Mojtaba allegedly retracted the confession and claimed there had been no witnesses.

Legal analyst and Journalist at Iran International TV, Nargess Tavassolian said: ‘This case is very strange, it is not known why the uncle was released after only two weeks.

‘The most important issue is the independence of the judiciary so that a criminal cannot get off the hook through his “connections” and get freed on bail easily.’

She added: ‘The judiciary is losing its independence more and more.

‘There are only two cases where the law allows for the murderer to either escape punishment or receive a more lenient punishment, but none of these laws apply here.’"

247,5,"Dan Savage is a well-known advocate for LGBT rights and host of the “Savage Lovecast” podcast. And he says he’s sick and tired of all the deference being shown to Melania Trump by many in this country.

Savage began one his podcasts by announcing:

Then Savage went on to explain why he feels so strongly about the current First Lady:

“I’m not alone in loathing Donald Trump’s third wife. She’s married to a misogynist after all. Odds are good her husband hates her too. “But there are some folks on the left who not only don’t hate her, they view her as some sort of sympathetic figure. The pretty princess in the tower locked up by the orange ogre with the bad combover, a princess desperately blinking out distress signals during swearing-in ceremonies and inaugural balls.”



 Savage theorizes that liberals have an “undeservedly charitable view” of Melania Trump because she’s attractive, so she has to be pretty on the inside, too. Savage says he could not disagree more strongly:



 As evidence, Savage reminded his listeners of two things:
• Melania is a birther who “went on TV to push the same racist conspiracy theories about Barack Obama that her husband did.”
• Her hypocritical views on immigration, her plagiarism, and her lawsuits against the media:

And Savage said the double standard of how Melania Trump is treated compared to Michelle Obama also angers him:

“I don’t know if you can impeach a first lady or how that would work. But I do know that we would have found out pretty fucking fast if Michelle Obama had said the same during her husband’s presidency.”



 Add to all of this the fact that Melania wore a jacket as she was boarding a plane to visit children who had been ripped away from their parents by her husband which read:

Considering the case Savage makes — and what we’ve seen from the current First Lady — it does make you wonder if she gives a damn about anything but herself."

249,5,"Stopping trump from Being an Energy Vampire

He’s Sucking the Life Out of the Country

For anyone that had the disdain to see trump throughout the years, you would have recognized that he was and will always be a narcissist sociopath who has a need to have constant attention on him. This is a standard for those that are energy vampires, because their goal for survival is to take all of your energy and leave you completely drained. You may know a few of these people in your life, and you can recognize the symptoms of interaction because after you are done with them, you are exhausted. Like a badly written script, we are watching the country get sucked into a vortex while his adoring cult drools and supports him.

The media was responsible for giving this dictator wannabe the platform that he desired, and they did it all for ratings. Yes, another example of throwing the country under the bus so that they could line their pockets, but in their case, it’s backfiring. You see, trump is using the same playbook as many of the worst dictators by trying to turn public view against the very media that gave him his position. Like the vampires of old, trump has drained as much as he can from the media and he has turned his eyes to the entire country.

Energy vampires have existed throughout history. Some are oblivious of what they are doing, a second type may be charming and friendly, while others are very aware and do it with malicious intent. The third type are the individuals that are obviously obnoxious, require that all of the focus be on them and their situations, and carry no empathy for others or anyone that is around them.

You innately know when you are around someone that exudes positive energy. These are the people that you are drawn to, that make you feel content when you are around them, and that you often see others feeling the same way when they are in his or her presence. There is a positive exchange that is both calming and welcoming.

This is not the case with trump. He is in a constant feeding frenzy, and the more that he takes, the more that he wants. He can’t have a single day without all of the topics of conversation talking about him, whether it is negative or not. To him, any and all focus, good or bad, is the meal of energy that he desires, and he will go to any lengths to get it; including making up outrageous lies to redirect.

Meanwhile, the media has tried to “normalize” his behavior. Like the vampire that makes every attempt to fit in to regular society, they have given trump the platform that he craves. However, at every turn he proves that he is not only inept, but incapable of doing anything except taking. The media has devoted hours to debating his utter catastrophe of a presence, and trying very hard to fit him into the position. Energy vampires depend on people making these mistakes, and all the while they continue to shift, change, and attack to maintain their feeding.

Some Are More Sensitive to Energy Vampires

On the day of the presidential election results announcement, there was a national scream that went out across the country. The yell was deafening to those that are sensitive, and it alerted everyone to the horrors to come. Those that were particularly in touch cried and sobbed. This wasn’t a situation that was complaining about a political loss, but a personal condition knowing that evil was about to take over.

Those that have the highest levels of sensitivity were experiencing the pain throughout the election campaign. Every time he opened his mouth, it was like a high-pitched siren going off and hot-iron piercing the brain. His constant state of hatred, bigotry, racism, and sexism was too much for many, so they had to forgo even looking at him. All people of critical thinking and common sense emotions saw it on the evening of the debates, when he was stalking Hillary Clinton. He exuded the predator that he is on that evening.

The knuckledraggers that support him eagerly give their energy to him because they get something in return. These are people that are energized by pure hate. It is an elixir for them and not only jumpstarts them, but keeps them going. This is the same type of reaction that has happened every time a dictator has come to power. Like a mindless rabble, they eagerly cling to every word of destruction that he spews and they cheer and chant.

The cult supporters of trump laugh at those that are sensitive, referring to their suffering as “trump derangement syndrome.” However, every psychologist will tell you that the lack of empathy, feelings, and humanity that the supporters and trump show, are the signs of a mental disorder. In the case of trump, narcissism and sociopathic behaviors are learned, and not a mental health issue. He has honed these as part of his survival tactics throughout the years and he preys on both those that support him and those that he drains of energy.

Someone said that trump has taken up so much of our attention that we don’t even have to say his name. We can simply say “him” and everyone knows who we are talking about. There are ways that we can stop the insanity, and it takes a group effort.

The first step is in recognizing what he is; an energy vampire who will be willing to do anything to anyone to get his way. The media is slowly coming around and as the court of public opinion continues to shift against him, they will go in the direction that brings them ratings. One thing that we can do that the media pays attention to is to call all of the stations. You may think it’s a small action, but it makes a difference to the way that they shape their reports.

Continued exposure of his idiocies can happen in not so passive aggressive ways. There are two things that he cannot handle: being made fun of and losing. A constant barrage on social media, specifically Twitter, magnifying his idiotic comments will act as a catalyst that media will amplify. This will be a cascading effect because even though the GOP acts like they support him, they hold him in disdain. He has been a useful tool to get their agenda accomplished, but they know that time is ending. When the public turns on him, they don’t want to be in the line of fire because many are up for re-election.

Being aware of and reporting the social media pages and individuals that look and sound like they are part of the Russian IRA interference is another step. You don’t have to comment, but with mass reporting, you can get them identified and removed. It may take a bit of watching and reading, but you can usually tell them because they all seem to have the same parroted comments in supporting “him.” Look for statements that use the economy and jobs as examples of success, attacks on both Hillary and President Obama, the usual (and frankly getting old) yells of “fake news,” denial of facts that are presented, and accusations that they are the victims. They are typically on every newsfeed that reports any real news that they don’t want to hear, especially the concentration camps for children.

Refusing to watch or support any of the channels that show his rallies, which are little more than Hitler-esque rage rants. If you let the channels know that you aren’t watching AND that you will boycott any sponsors this can hit their bank accounts.

Unmasking an energy vampire means that you have to take proactive actions for yourself, and in this case, for our country. These are each small steps, but as you move forward they will have a cumulative effect like the proverbial “stake in the heart” for traditional vampires. As your energy is renewed you will feel empowered and this will allow you to take additional steps.

The time has come to stop being drained and turn the tables on those that want to permeate our country with hate."
250,5,"Back in 2004, some Ohioans waited in line for 10 hours to vote as President George W. Bush carried the state, and with it, the election. After reforms were put in place, voting went much more smoothly in 2008 and ’12, when Ohio twice went for Barack Obama.

So naturally, Republicans are now looking to turn the clock back a decade.

Tuesday, the state legislature will hold hearings on four new GOP-backed measures that, taken as a whole, could make voting much harder in the Buckeye State, especially for racial minorities, students, and the poor:
• None One bill would reduce the number of voting machines that counties must have on hand, almost inevitably leading to longer wait times at the polls.
• None A second would attack the state’s successful absentee ballot program. Last year, Secretary of State Jon Husted mailed absentee ballots to every registered voter, and nearly 1.3 million Ohioans cast one. But the new bill would dramatically limit the period when absentee ballots can be sent, and bar counties from sending them, instead allowing only the secretary of state, with approval from lawmakers, to do so.
• None A third measure would cut early voting by six days and end same-day registration, when voters can register and vote on the same day. Voting rights advocates say they expect additional drastic cuts to the early voting period.
• None And a fourth would reduce from 10 to three the number of days given to voters casting a provisional ballot to return with the information needed to make their vote count.

The proposed voting restrictions were flagged Saturday by the blog Plunderbund, which has closely followed the fight over voting rights in Ohio.

The clear combined effect would be not just to reduce opportunities for voting. It would also be to significantly increase the number of voters showing up on Election Day, while reducing the number of machines made available to them. The obvious likely result: longer lines at the polls, deterring some voters from casting a ballot.

We’ve been here before. The excessive lines in Ohio in 2004, concentrated in urban areas with high minority populations, turned the state into the poster child for election problems, and spurred reforms over the next few years. (One DNC study found 174,000 would-be voters left before casting a ballot, thanks to the lines.) Among those reforms were increased early and absentee voting, and efforts to ensure counties had the right amount of staff and equipment at each polling place. The last two presidential elections saw no repeat of 2004’s problems.

Still, not everything went perfectly last year, when there were several reports of long lines in urban centers after Republicans cut early voting hours. That suggests that further reductions in early and absentee voting could be disastrous.

“It’s very well documented the problems we had in 2004, with the horrible long lines,” Carrie Davis, the executive director of the Ohio League of Women Voters, told msnbc. “The reason we opened up absentee and early voting to everyone … was to combat the long lines and problems we had back in ‘04. This is taking us backwards.”

Any voting legislation passed by lawmakers would go to the desk of Gov. John Kasich, a Republican, who has said little about his stance on the issue.

A commission appointed by President Obama this year aims to reduce long lines at the polls, after some Florida voters waited eight hours or more last fall. The panel is scheduled to produce recommendations by early January."
251,5,"Never one to merely brush off even the most minor of slights — given his vengeful personality — President Trump naturally felt compelled to respond to the widely publicized and brutally honest response given by the United States women’s national soccer team co-captain, Megan Rapinoe, to a reporter asking whether she would be excited to visit the White House if her team won the Women’s World Cup.

Rapinoe’s answer was an incredulous and spontaneous emotional reaction.

This morning Trump went out of his way to prove Rapinoe wrong by extending an invitation to the team while making it clear that he believes that Rapinoe has no right to even comment on any invitation to meet the president until after her team actually wins the championship.

Shortly after beginning his tweet, Trump’s fractured syntax diverts mid-sentence to comment on a variety of other subjects, displaying an insidious internalized racism, before returning to his original topic.

Besides his thoughts on the ownership structure and nomenclature of the NBA, and a defensive — and now outdated — claim about black unemployment, he also includes lies about the U.S. poverty index, a calculation that he has tried to redefine to make the numbers look better.

Trump’s claims that “leagues and teams love coming to the White House” is belied by the many players who have declined the invitation to feast on the insulting fast food buffet that the president has unprecedentedly offered as celebratory fare for the victorious teams that he treats like trained monkeys, not worthy of the expense of a regular White House meal.

Trump’s decision to invite the women’s national soccer team to the White House “win or lose” would likely not have happened without Rapinoe’s vehement declaration that she wouldn’t attend and her doubts about whether women’s soccer was even on the president’s radar.

President Trump lectures the team’s co-captain as if her objection to meeting him stems from a lack of patriotism rather than her strenuous objection to the horrific policies of his administration in every area of its governance.

While Rapinoe has yet to reply to the president’s personal reprimand — probably because she’s focused on the next match in the Women’s World Cup — she could easily respond with the assertion that she is indeed proud of our flag and our country. It’s simply the corruption, incompetence, and evil policies of the current administration that leads her to believe that the United States is doing less than “GREAT.”

Of course there are exceptions and aberrations, but what I witnessed, what we are witnessing is a migration of folks who hold inherent indigenous technologies that will enhance our communities here in the US, as we face issues exacerbated by War Economy, like climate change, and the continued diasporas that will ensue as a result.

Adherence to these natural systems yields the sustenance of a healthy society that understands that one person’s whole survival is dependent on the survival of the group.

Often, while watching them laugh with their children, chit chat and just be, I often wonder about them seeking refuge in a country where the overall culture has lost its way.

During these moments I am also reminded of the harvest of The Local Peace Economy organized by Jodie and her active group in Los Angeles as well as Xan Joi and the Bay Area crew and other CODEPINK folks who joined in this effort.

The way the donations rolled in for the Caravaners — quickly- the way new friendships popped off, community sprouted, stories were shared, issues and tensions dissolved-resolved, information moved, people moved... support of life, true engagement and new neuro-pathways blazed!

The Local Peace Economy is always already paving the way as we walk it, so all needs are met and no one is left behind.

These thoughts help me not break down over a world I just don’t understand anymore.

A world of chaos, confusion, and more hate (fear) than I ever could have imagined.

I find myself inviting these thoughts to take root as I consider what a gift it is to be able to utilize my life’s energy to share The Local Peace Economy and its ethos, throughout the world and watch what happens as it unfolds.

Thinking like that gives clarity a boost and fuels the fire for the courage to push forward.

Thinking about the bad things, the dark things, all the stuff I saw back there in TJ, can lead to depression, anxiety, self-medication and fear-all things that fuel War Economy... not the Peaceful future we know is possible if we keep at it.

What has happened here in the US around War Economy juxtaposed hyperbolic growth of consumerism... like a cancer... in the last 50 years, is reasonable.

Like, I can look at it and see what has happened and why. I follow the timeline, I see the themes, the mythologies, the players and understand.

But the repercussions, the impact; despiritualization; an industrialized, de-natured food system; acute loneliness; deep, deep-seated fears; dis-eases like manic depression; eating disorders; drug addiction; malignant narcissism and so many adults AND children wanting to end their time here on Earth by their own hand... well the repercussions are hideous and profane and brain-bending.

And then there’s The Local Peace Economy.

The Local Peace Economy prescribes making a pot of tea, once a month... take 90 minutes and talk with friends... neighbors... folks in your community.

Have them bring a little something to share and just talk about the world you want to live in...explore some pathways... dream some pathways, get cracking and see the magic.

As we sail back up the road to Los Angeles and the texts about the police surrounding the warehouse at Benito Juarez look more and more ominous, I know that our job is to focus on the magic of The Local Peace Economy.

Knowing that it will illuminate pathways we never could have imagined and heal us along the way gives me the courage and the faith to keep going.

I have more gratitude for the lessons of my time with The Caravan than I will ever be able to express to them, so I will have to carry these lessons and continue scattering the seeds.

253,5,"President Donald Trump went on a tear on Twitter on Tuesday morning, demanding an apology from The New York Times, complaining he doesn’t get enough credit for the economy, claiming Twitter discriminates against him and ripping into the “Radical Left Democrats.”

It was a dizzying burst from Trump, who has bounced from claiming victory after the release of special counsel Robert Mueller’s report to seeking revenge on the media, Democrats and even his own aides.

In all, Trump tweeted or retweeted more than 50 times in a 24-hour period.

The media was the primary target of Trump's ire Tuesday morning, as he complained that he is subject to an unprecedented level of press scrutiny and lashed out at outlets from The New York Times to morning cable news shows while also taking shots at individual personalities.

“Paul Krugman, of the Fake News New York Times, has lost all credibility, as has the Times itself, with his false and highly inaccurate writings on me,” Trump wrote in his first post of the day, attacking the economic columnist who is often critical of the White House. “He is obsessed with hatred, just as others are obsessed with how stupid he is. He said Market would crash, Only Record Highs!”

In a second tweet, the president added: “I wonder if the New York Times will apologize to me a second time, as they did after the 2016 Election. But this one will have to be a far bigger & better apology. On this one they will have to get down on their knees & beg for forgiveness-they are truly the Enemy of the People!”

In a letter to readers after the 2016 elections, then-publisher Arthur Sulzberger Jr. and executive editor Dean Baquet wondered whether Trump’s “sheer unconventionality lead us and other news outlets to underestimate his support among American voters” and pledged to rededicate the paper to probing the driving forces of the election. But Trump has frequently claimed that the Times apologized to him for its coverage in the wake of his election, something the paper has repeatedly denied doing.

Trump then turned his fire more generally to the rest of the media, accusing ""totally insane"" Democrats of colluding with the news organizations to hamper his presidency, although he offered no evidence of such a conspiracy.

“I guess that means that the Republican agenda is working,” he wrote, teasing: “Stay tuned for more!”

He asserted, falsely, in yet another tweet that he was entitled to more positive coverage based on the strength of the economy, claiming that “in the ‘old days’ if you were President and you had a good economy, you were basically immune from criticism.”

He went on: “Today I have, as President, perhaps the greatest economy in history...and to the Mainstream Media, it means NOTHING. But it will!”

He complained that the economy's strength under his administration should inoculate him against criticism that he has nonetheless been the subject of.

To bolster his argument, Trump also invoked a catchphrase coined by former President Bill Clinton — “it’s the economy, stupid” — while ignoring that Clinton was impeached by the House despite overseeing a thriving economy in the '90s.

The president's venting came on the heels of last week's release of Mueller’s report on Russia's election interference, which cleared Trump on allegations of collusion but offered a damning view of his White House and has driven talk of potential impeachment back onto the airwaves.

Trump has fumed over the public response to Mueller’s report and how his advisers are portrayed in it, taking his frustration to his Twitter feed where he has tweeted or retweeted more than 100 times in the five-day span since the report’s release.

His apparent fury with the media may also stem from how much of its reporting that he has derided as “fake news” over the past two years of the Russia probe was borne out in Mueller’s findings.

Adding to the pile on: A poll released Monday showed his approval rating had plummeted 5 percentage points to match his lowest all-time.

Trump's screed also came hours before he was set to honor White House News Photographers Association award recipients in the Oval Office and days before the White House Correspondents’ Association hosts its annual dinner on Saturday night. Trump, amid his Twitter flurry, broke from criticizing news outlets and personalities by name to plug the rally he is set to hold in Wisconsin instead of attending the dinner.

But he quickly returned to his grievances. He offered up his thoughts on three cable networks’ morning news shows, calling “Fox & Friends,” on which he receives almost unflinchingly positive coverage, ""by far the best of the morning political shows on television.” He ripped MSNBC's ""Morning Joe,"" on which he was once a frequent guest, and CNN's ""New Day"" as far inferior to their Fox News counterpart.

The president mocked CNN for promoting former “New Day” host Chris Cuomo and giving him his own prime-time show despite what Trump contended was “his massive failure in the morning.”

To “Morning Joe” co-host Joe Scarborough, Trump offered tongue-in-cheek thanks for helping ""get me elected in 2016 by having me on (free) all the time.” The president said the MSNBC morning show, on which he is the subject of near-constant criticism, “has nosedived, too Angry, Dumb and Sick.”

Scarborough, whose show was airing live as Trump’s tweets posted, took the opportunity to respond to the president on-air.

“Hi, Donald, how you doing? We love that you watch us,” he said.

“Tell him to stop. It's a sickness,” co-host Mika Brzezinski interjected, and as the show’s panel dismissed and ridiculed Trump’s barbs, the chyron was changed to read “Morning Psycho responds to faithful viewer.”

Scarborough then took a more serious tone, thanking the show’s employees and noting that ratings were continuing to climb before facetiously thanking Trump.

“We thank the president for drawing everybody's attention to it,” he joked.

The Times offered a more solemn response to the president’s tirade, replying on Twitter with a link to publisher A.G. Sulzberger’s response from February to his attacks on the media.

“The phrase ‘enemy of the people’ is not just false, it’s dangerous,” it read. “It has an ugly history of being wielded by dictators and tyrants who sought to control public information.”

The Times’ opinion division also defended Krugman from the president’s attacks, noting that in 2008 he won the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences.

“He is a valued member of our team of Opinion columnists,” it wrote on Twitter, linking to his columns.

In another set of tweets, Trump laid into Twitter, quoting a guest on Maria Bartiromo's Fox Business show who called him the “best thing ever to happen to Twitter” but complaining that the platform doesn’t “treat me well as a Republican.”

He repeated criticisms from conservatives who accuse the social media outlet of censoring them, calling the site “very discriminatory.” Trump also claimed, without evidence, that Twitter made it “hard for people to sign on” and is “constantly taking people off [the] list,” apparently chiding the company for its removal of bot accounts or referring to accusations the network applies “shadow bans” to conservatives.

“Big complaints from many people...But should be much higher than that if Twitter wasn’t playing their political games,” he wrote. “No wonder Congress wants to get involved - and they should. Must be more, and fairer, companies to get out the WORD!”"

256,5,"With a fight over increasing the debt ceiling looming in Washington, D.C., and with Speaker Nancy Pelosi controlling the purse strings, you can be sure she’s looking for ways to politicize events.

When it comes to the national debt, the only thing as sure as the reality that it will go up is that the two parties will battle to sway the public’s perception of whose fault it is, but Fox News is citing “urgent” calls between Pelosi and Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin to report that there may be trouble on the horizon.

“House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) and Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin have become phone friends of late. They’ve burned up the lines more than teenyboppers singing “Telephone Hour” in Bye Bye Birdie,” Fox News’s Chad Pergram wrote.

According to Pergram, Pelosi is not too fond of acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney and prefers to work with Mnuchin on the debt ceiling issue.

Pelosi and Mnuchin reportedly spoke last Wednesday night about an urgent need to raise the debt limit, twice on Thursday and again midday Friday. This was followed by a 12-minute chat Saturday night and an exchange of letters.

All of which indicates there’s a problem.

The problem is that Mnuchin is imploring Congress to raise the debt ceiling right away – before lawmakers abandon Washington for most of August and the traditional summer recess. That’s because few in Washington paid close attention to this issue until a few days ago. That’s when Mnuchin suggested the government could “run out of cash in early September, before Congress reconvenes.” Government reserves will soon dwindle to about $250 billion. The accelerated timetable is partly due to diminished revenues, attributable to the new tax law.

In her missive to Mnuchin, Pelosi insisted on a deal on “spending priorities,” which is a ploy to lift mandatory spending caps Congress imposed in a 2011.

With President Trump stressing a need for more defense spending, Pelosi seems to be willing to give up a little while pushing for “parity,” which takes the form of a bump for all non-defense programs, Fox News reported.

The two sides have been talking for months about a possible two-year agreement on the spending caps and the debt limit and this possible stalemate comes after Senate Majority Leader Mithch McConnell said in May that they could be hours away from an agreement.

But that was then and this is now.

The spending cap issue could wait until January, and a senior Congressionalsource told Fox News that a short-term extension of the debt limit may have to happen, but Pelosi is reportedly now coupling these issues.

All of which suggests Democrats have developed what they see as a winning narrative in forcing a government shutdown — at least until Trump starts tweeting."

Scientists studied the DNA of skeletons from a 3,000-year-old Philistine cemetery and published their findings last week in the journal Science Advances. The study showed the DNA was related to the gene pool of southern Europe.

The Philistine cemetery was uncovered in 2016 in Ashkelon, in southern Israel. Ten of 108 skeletons had sufficient DNA to be used.

“A new study of DNA recovered from an ancient Philistine site in the Israeli city of Ashkelon confirms what we know from the Bible -- that the origin of the Philistines is in southern Europe,” Netanyahu wrote.

Netanyahu then referenced Amos 9:7 and Jeremiah 47:4, which say the Philistines came from Caphtor – modern-day Crete, the Greek island in southern Europe.

“The Bible mentions a place called Caphtor, which is probably modern-day Crete,” Netanyahu wrote. “There’s no connection between the ancient Philistines & the modern Palestinians, whose ancestors came from the Arabian Peninsula to the Land of Israel thousands of years later.”

Netanyahu concluded, “The Palestinians’ connection to the Land of Israel is nothing compared to the 4,000-year connection that the Jewish people have with the land.”

The word “Palestinian” is thought to have derived from “Philistine,” although modern-day Palestinians say they did not originate from that people group.

The Philistines often warred with the biblical Hebrews. Goliath, who was defeated and killed by David, was a Philistine.

“For more than a century, we have debated the question of where the Philistines came from,” archaeologist Eric Cline told National Geographic in an email. “Now we have the answer: Southern Europe, and probably more specifically mainland Greece, Crete, or Sardinia. This fits with what had seemed the most likely answer previously, especially judging from [the archaeological remains], and so this seems a logical finding.”

265,5,"HYDERABAD, India, July 15, 2019 (Morning Star News) – Christians who worshipped privately in their homes in a village in eastern India were dragged to local leaders last month and forced to bow to a goddess idol, sources said.

The mob action on June 14 followed an announcement two days earlier by the heads of Mahuatoli village, Gumla District in Jharkhand state, that 12 Christian families would be banished if they did not return to the tribal Sarna religion, they said.

Threatened with death, most of the Christian families have fled the village.

“Threats have always been there in this area in Gumla District, but it had never escalated to this point that the Sarna extremists vowed to take lives,” said area pastor Boyen Munda. “They are not in a right state of mind now. The Hindu extremist forces have joined hands with them and have been inciting them against the believers.”

The mob of 20 villagers broke into the home of Jogiya Munda and pushed him and his widowed mother out of their house, the pastor said. Munda and his mother, who have been Christians for 17 years, were dragged to the village leaders and forced to sit and bow to the goddess idol, Pastor Munda said.

“They poured buckets of water on them [as a purification rite] and made them do a ritual which is believed to be a procedure to renounce Christ,” Pastor Munda said. “They fled to a safer place very far away. The village heads plotted to kill the mother and son if they find them praying any day after the ‘reconversion ritual.’”

The Sarna ritual is akin to a last chance for those who have left to return to their former tribal religion, he said. Two families who were also forced to undergo the ritual ostensibly renounced Christ and remain in the village, he said.

“But they shared with us that they have not done it on their will but because of the pressure they had been put through,” Pastor Munda said. “It has been a month since the Christians are scattered in neighboring villages seeking refuge. It is the monsoon season, so if they can’t return back to cultivate their land, they will have to go hungry for next one year.”

The Sarna villagers had refused to supply water for the Christian families’ farm fields, disconnected their electricity and threatened to stop all government benefits, he said.

“But they [10 Christian families] stood against the plots devised by the most powerful religious extremists,” Pastor Munda told Morning Star News.

He said the Christians never held group worship in Mahuatoli village, instead traveling to Dolaichi for more secure worship.

“They never had an open service or loudspeakers – it has always been a private family prayer at each individual’s house,” he said. “Even that few minutes of private prayer is being seen as crime.”

At the June 12 meeting of leaders in Mahuatoli, the 12 Christian families were summoned for the public announcement of their banishment from the village.

“The Sarna religious heads and village council were present,” area Christian Gangadhar Munda told Morning Star News. “In front of the villagers, they declared us as ‘polluted’ and that the village should be cleansed from Christianity.”

The leader read out orders for villagers to refrain from mingling with Christians, exclude them from family and social gatherings, and to refrain from speaking with them, buying from or selling to them, or having any communication with them, Gangadhar Munda said.

Distressed by the orders, Christians Mangra Munda Junior and Balveer Munda, along with Gangadhar Munda, raised their concern, he said.

“We told the village heads that we don’t approve their decision, and that it is a fundamental right, and that we are free to practice Christianity,” he said. “We said we belong to this village as rightfully as other Sarna villagers. We did not commit any crime to be humiliated and ostracized publicly like this. How can they pass rules convenient only to them?”

The village leaders rebuked them for objecting to their ruling, he said.

“It angered them that we raised a voice against them,” he said. “They said, ‘These Christians should be cleansed at the pandal [a raised platform for seating idols].’ But some of the village heads said that we should not be forced, and that if any Christian wants to return to Sarna faith, they should come to the pandal on their own. Nobody among our 12 families accepted this offer. We stood strong in faith and decided that no matter what happens, we will not give up our faith.”

In the early evening, however, a large mob showed up at Balveer Munda’s house, he said. They destroyed the entrance and demolished the walls, and when Balveer Munda tried to stop them, they shoved him away and stole food grain, clothes and chickens, Gangadhar Munda said.

“It was a robbery in broad daylight,” he said. “When we tried to stop them, the mob threatened us that we would be killed if we don’t vacate the village immediately. Their threats grew intense; they said they will not offer us even a drop of water, and that our lands will be snatched away if we don’t obey their orders and convert to Sarna.”

His wife, he added, was in her 39th week of pregnancy at the time.

“They terrorized the woman and children,” he said. “My wife was horrified watching them threatening me that they would kill me. She was panicked and under stress the past month.”

Anima Munda, who gave birth on July 10, told Morning Star News that the family immediately fled to Dolaichi, nearly four miles from Mahuatoli, on foot.

“I’m scared to go back to our home,” she said.

Her husband said leaving their home at that time was especially difficult, and his wife’s inability to eat well since then weakened her, contributing to a prolonged labor of 24 hours.

“We had no other option but to move from the comfort of our home to a believer’s house in neighboring village,” he said. “It was a sudden decision, and my wife had not fully adjusted herself here and had not been eating well. The doctors said she was too weak for labor.”

On June 17, the Christian families went to Bharno police station to submit a complaint, but officers refused to register their pleas and advised them to arrange a “compromise” and not file a case.

They then filed a complaint online, thus getting a First Information Report (FIR) registered, met with the Gumla District superintendent and handed over copies of the complaint and FIR, sources said.

A source who spoke on condition of anonymity said Hindu extremists influenced the villagers.

“We received information that the villagers received orders from Hindu Jagran Manch [Hindu Awakening Forum], an affiliate of the Vishwa Hindu Parishad [World Hindu Council] and its youth militant partner, Bajrang Dal,” the source said.

Aggrieved by police inaction, the Christians filed a private complaint under Section 200 of the Criminal Procedure Code in Gumla District Court on June 26. A hearing was scheduled for Monday (July 15), attorney Makshud Alam said.

“An increasing number of incidents of mob violence are happening in Jharkhand,” Alam said. “The extremist forces are setting up [tribal] Advisasis against Muslims and Christians.”

Police officials at the Bharno police station denied that the Christians came for help.

“They never approached us, and we did not receive any complaint,” Jaswinder Choudhary, the officer in charge of the station, told Morning Star News. “There are no religious issues in Mahuatoli village, and everybody is living in peace. If there be any problem, they can always file a complaint, and we will take action.”

Local newspapers tending to sympathize with Hindu nationalism such as Dainik Bhaskar, Prabhat Khabar and OP India claimed that Christians underwent gharwapasi (“reconversion” or “homecoming”), and that they were lured into Christianity earlier for healing.

Jharkhand state has a recent history of anti-Christian violence. On April 10, Jharkhand police found four Christians lying in a pool of blood in Gumla District. A mob of 25 Hindu vigilantes trying to stop the slaughter of cows, which are considered sacred, had accused the Christians of killing cows and attacked them with swords and sickles.

One of the four, Prakash Lakra, reportedly succumbed to his injuries.

“The state government and the ruling BJP [Bharatiya Janata Party] are complicit in targeting the church and the Christian community,” John Dayal of the United Christian Forum told Morning Star News. “They have ranged tribal Sarna who are not Hindus against their brethren who have accepted Christ.”

Hindu extremists are targeting the church with an eye to grabbing land allotted to or bought for Catholic and Protestant educational and medical institutions the past century, he said.

“And they are persecuting missionaries, including Catholic nuns,” Dayal said. “The chief minister himself is party to hate speech. It needs be remembered that a Christian has been lynched by ‘cow vigilantes’ in the recent past.”

Advocacy group Alliance Defending Freedom-India has recorded close to 160 incidents of hostilities against Christians in the first half of 2019.

Anti-Christian sentiment has grown worse since the BJP’s rise to power in 2014, according to Andreas Thonhauser, director of external relations at ADF International. Hindu nationalist Prime Minister Narendra Modi was re-elected earlier this year.

“Many Christians had hoped that voters would not grant him a second term as prime minister of the world’s largest democracy,” Thonhauser wrote in a recent issue of the Catholic Herald. “While Modi won his first elections primarily on economic and reform-oriented ideas, this time his party focused on Indian identity and the Hindu nation.”

The outcome of the elections is not good news for the country’s Christians, Thonhauser wrote.

“Although Christians comprise only 2.3 percent of India’s population, they are known for running excellent schools and well-maintained hospitals,” he wrote. “Anti-Christian sentiment is not a new phenomenon. Nevertheless, the situation has grown worse since the current ruling party’s rise to power in 2014.”

India is ranked 10th on Christian support organization Open Doors’ 2019 World Watch List of the countries where it is most difficult to be a Christian. The country was 31st in 2013, but its position has been worse each year since Modi came to power.

266,5,"Crackpot billionaire PayPal and Palantir founder Peter Thiel, an avid Donald Trump supporter/adviser most known as regular sayer of outlandish things, appeared on Tucker Carlson's white nationalist-promoting Fox News show on Monday. Why a billionaire felt the need to slum around on a show more regularly devoted to promoting fringe figures mainstreaming the ideas of racist websites we (cough) cannot fathom, but he brought his own new conspiracy theory to Carlson's audience, claiming that tech giant Google is secretly working with China to do ""seemingly treasonous"" things to the United States.

But as a Trump booster, he also took the opportunity to insult Trump's potential 2020 opponents en masse. Except one:

""I'm most scared by Elizabeth Warren. I think she's the one who's actually talking about the economy, which is the only thing, the thing that I think matters by far the most.""

Warren is not the only one talking about the economy, but she has differentiated herself from the other candidates in her very specific diagnosis of the economy's woes. She believes that corporations and the wealthy have dramatically unbalanced and endangered the economy through specific acts of deregulation and de-taxation, and has outlined a program to re-establish rules intended to protect the broader economy—and, especially, consumers—from predatory upper-crust manipulation.

It is this focus on pulling the American version of capitalism back from the brink of overt kleptocracy that has the financial industry, in particular, in spasms. Many of the too-late protections established after the last financial crisis, a crisis caused entirely by widespread crookery in the financial sector, have already been undone by still-compliant legislators and regulators. The notion of instituting fixes closer to the core of continued Wall Street recklessness has the nation's most reckless figures fearing their best money-squeezing schemes might soon by drying up.

As for Warren, she has no illusions that the Peter Thiels of the world (PayPal, remember) can be convinced to support capitalist reforms rather than fighting them tooth-and-nail, and lobbyist-and-pocketbook. Responding to reports of Thiel's remarks, Warren only tweeted: ""Good."""

The purpose behind this monument, built between 3000 and 1600 B.C., remains a mystery to historians. But, as Stonehenge enthusiasts know, the pillars of the monument are in just the right location to perfectly frame the rising sun on the day of the summer solstice.

According to the website EarthSky, “[I]f you stand in just the right place inside the Stonehenge monument on the day of the northern summer solstice, facing northeast through the entrance towards a rough-hewn stone outside the circle—known as the Heel Stone—you will see the sun rise above the Heel Stone.” For a stunning image of the alignment, view this article at EarthSky.

A few articles published this week about Stonehenge’s connection to the summer solstice bring up yet another interesting tidbit about the monument. “Many assume that cavemen built the monumental megalith in Wilshire,” writes Sean Martin at Express, “but new evidence suggests that brainiacs could have been behind the building of Stonehenge.” This book, Megalith, takes a look at the geometry of the monument, postulating that the builders likely used the Pythagorean Theorem to build Stonehenge.

The crazy part is that Pythagoras, the Greek philosopher who came up with the theorem (which says that “the sum areas of two squares on two sides of a triangle will always add up to the area of a square on the hypotenuse”) wasn’t born until 2,000 years later, in 570 B.C.

If the author is right, then this poses an issue for the common view that people at that time were primitive beasts, just a step up from apes. As one contributor to the book, John Matineau, explained, “People think of our ancestors as rough cavemen but they were applying Pythagorean geometry over 2,000 years before Pythagoras was born.” Sorry, Pythagoras. You’re not as original as you thought you were.

270,5,"This year’s Fourth of July celebration on the National Mall in Washington, DC has become a stop on the Trump for President re-election campaign trail. His “Salute to America” has become a “Salute to Donald Trump.” He has called the events the “show of a lifetime!” and an unprecedented celebration of American military strength.

Presidents have traditionally stayed away from July 4 celebrations out of concern that it would politicize independence day. The last time there was a similar attempt at a Presidential take-over of the Fourth of July was fifty years ago in 1970 when President Nixon, appearing by video from the White House, wanted a huge display for support for the Vietnam War. However, the Mall ending up being filled with anti-war protesters whose presence symbolized the outrage at the war on Vietnam.

The last time a president took part in a July 4 program in Washington DC was in 1987 and the last time military tanks were seen on DC streets was 27 years ago during the 1991 Gulf War parade.

Trump’s militarized Mall has the feeling of Red Square and Pyongyang—and France’s Bastille Day which Trump seems to be trying to replicate his trip to Paris two summers ago. The “supreme leader” wannabe of the United States will preside over jet fly-overs, including one from the Air Force One fleet, and tanks, admittedly, not many of them because the crumbling roads of the nation’s capital cannot withstand the weight of the huge military equipment.

Joining the Air Force One plane will be Blue Angels, an F-35 jet from the Navy, at least one aircraft from Marine Helicopter Squadron One, a B-2 stealth bomber, and F-22 Raptor fighter jets. Commercial air traffic into National Airport will be disrupted for three hours as Trump smiles triumphantly from the steps of the Lincoln Memorial.

Trump’s decision to capture the Fourth of July for his personal use and the huge expense that U.S.military, National Park Service and the City of Washington is incurring, no doubt is causing great heartburn in career government employees in the Pentagon, State Department and probably even in the White House, as well as from the general public. Pentagon officers refuse to provide information on the costs of the planes, tanks and other military equipment and are “hiding out and hoping it all blows over.""

US Congressional Representative Elijah Cummings tweeted that: “President Trump is willing to spend millions of taxpayer dollars and accept donations of fireworks for his partisan Fourth of July celebration while his Administration is turning away donations of diapers and toothpaste for immigrant children.”

Presidential candidate Marianne Williamson reflected the sentiments of many people throughout the country when she tweeted: “Watching army tanks being hauled through DC for Trump’s July 4 celebration is heartbreaking & repugnant.”

Despite complaints from Congresspersons, the DC city council and civil society, the military dominated Fourth of July will go forward. However, 12 years ago, during the Bush administration’s wars on Iraq and Afghanistan, citizen activism forced the Bush administration to end its military equipment display on the Mall that would take place every year on Mother’s Day, a day that was created as a call by mothers to end all wars. For five years, CODEPINK: Women for Peace organized demonstrations against the having military equipment on the National Mall. CODEPINKers climbed onto and into tanks and unfurled Stop the Wars and peace flags. We sang peace songs and gave away peace buttons while the military was giving away foam grenades as gifts. Finally, after five years, the military ended their equipment displays on the Mall on Mother’s Day.

This year, CODEPINK is challenging Trump and his policies by flying the internationally famous Trump Baby Balloon on the National Mall on July 4, and having a “Trump is a Big Baby Festival.” The 20-foot balloon that features Trump in a diaper and with a cellphone for his tweets is an apt symbol for a president who is so erratic, self-centered, prone to tantrums, and doesn’t care about the consequences of his actions. If Trump tries to do this antic again next year—politicizing and militarizing our national holiday—we better have more than a big balloon to greet him.

Medea Benjamin is the co-founder of CODEPINK: Women for Peace and the author of numerous books including “Inside Iran,” “Kingdom of the Unjust: Saudia Arabia” and “Killing by Remote Control-Drones.”

Ann Wright is a retired U.S. Army Colonel and a former U.S. diplomat who resigned in 2003 in opposition to Bush’s war on Iraq. She is the co-author of “Dissent: Voices of Conscience.”"
272,5,"Here is a Thought Experiment for you.

Sit down and give careful thought to what Bernie Sanders would try to do if he came into real political power…. like being President of the United States. Remember that Sanders is a hard-core, card-carrying socialist who spent his honeymoon in Russia. Remember, he campaigned for the Marxist party and supported Marxists in the Reagan era. The only reason he is running as a Democrat is because the U.S. socialist and Marxist parties have zero chance for victory in nation-wide elections.

Knowing that, what plans would Sanders try to put in place, as President? What Executive Orders would he probably impose, how would he re-engineer his Executive Branch agencies, and his Cabinet, to inflict his dirty work?

For starters, Sanders could try to nationalize the country’s educational system, so that what our children are taught in K-12 would be imposed by a federal program run by Sanders’ socialist appointees. This effort would be extended to include the nation’s colleges, so that federal money to colleges would be conditioned on following certain curriculums and courses of study.

As President, Sanders could initiate an enormous recruitment program to establish government-subsidized socialist cells locally all over the nation. Perhaps he would try to hide the names of the people recruited for these cells. Sanders might use federal resources to create a kind of intramural “Bernie Peace Corp.”, staffed with younger millennials with socialist stars in their eyes. These recruits could be propagandized and trained to run for city, county and state elected office. And Congress.

Bernie as president would most likely embark on a tried-and-true socialist blueprint that leaders of other socialist countries have imposed on their unfortunate populations. He could try to put the “workers” and his young recruits in charge of passing local legislation. Sanders would do this by creating top-down governing structures that would use their political power to dictate how socialism would be implemented at local levels.

Sanders could use eminent domain laws for “land reform”—to confiscate land and redistribute it, like the Communist Party did in China in 1949. Private farmland would be expropriated, or taken with minimal compensation, from private owners, “for public use” and turned into collective farm cooperatives governed by the farmworkers. Part of the land could be used for dormitories to house the government workers, using the farm products to feed them.

Sanders could try to use eminent domain and government money to take over oil & gas fields and fracking lands, and pipelines, so oil & gas revenues would be collected by the executive branch, to finance Sanders’ socialist programs.

Another initiative Bernie Sanders could impose is to use his Executive Branch agencies, and their rule-making ability, to impose new rules and ordinances that would be difficult or too costly to obey. Cleverly, these rules would not be “laws” because that’s the province of the Legislative Branch. Then when rules are broken by individuals or companies, Sanders’ executive agencies could charge enormous fines to the “rule-breakers”, to provide him more money to impose socialism.

What else would Crazy Bernie, who has nary an ounce of humor, likely do if he had the power? Let’s answer that with his own statements. He would abolish private insurance plans, replaced with a government-run plan, and would provide Medicare-For-All, hang the $33 trillion cost. Sanders supports free “unlimited” health care for all illegal aliens, and would not impose “criminal” penalties on them. He’s “for open borders”, the “Green New Deal” and a carbon tax, “affirmative action”, he’d kill the Electoral College, and “tax the middle class”. Sanders would re-join the Paris Agreement and the Iran Nuclear Deal, provide “free college tuition” and “eliminate student loan” debt. Bernie would not “support federal caps on medical malpractice lawsuits”, but he would increase the estate tax, raise the minimum wage, eliminate drone strikes, partially abolish ICE, impeach Trump, end capital punishment, and decrease the military budget.

There’s no doubt the legislative and judicial branches would try to block many Sanders initiatives, but the Executive Branch has substantial power to create rules and to determine how Congress’s laws are actually carried out.

If you do not believe Sanders would seek to accomplish these initiatives, you are woefully naïve and history-ignorant. These are the historical ways that socialists clinched power. Be warned.

Three days after he became president, Trump signed an executive order that denied U.S. assistance to any foreign-based organization that performs, promotes or offers information on abortion . A similar plan, known as the Mexico City policy, was in effect under past Republican presidents. But Trump expanded it exponentially to apply not just to around $600 million in overseas family-planning funds, but to the entire $8.8 billion in annual U.S. global health aid.

Abortion is one of the very few topics that manages to combine religion, politics, and sex, and it has REALLY screwed up our politics. I have 2 relatives who voted for Trump ONLY because of the abortion issue.

Up until about 10 years ago, I was pretty conservative on this issue, but gradually came to understand that my position was incorrect.

I just finished reading an excellent book bu Jodi Picoult titled ""a spark of light"", which is a story about a man who storms into the ONLY abortion clinic in Mississippi and starts shooting people. Like all her books, this one is thoroughly researched and thought provoking. There are 5 states, incidentally, that have only ONE clinic.

A paragraph from the author's notes in the book vividly demonstrates the hypocrisy of the ""pro-life"" people.

The National Abortion Federation compiles statistics on violence committed by anti-abortion protesters in the United States and Canada. Since 1977, there have been 17 attempted murders, 383 death threats, 153 incidents of assault and battery, 13 individuals wounded, 10 stink bombs, 373 break-ins, 42 bombings, 173 arsons, 91 attempted bombings or arsons, 619 bomb threats, 1630 acts of trespassing, 1264 incidents of vandalism, 655 anthrax threats, and 3 kidnappings.

11 people have been killed: four doctors, 2 clinic employees, a security guard, a police officer, a clinic escort, and 2 others.

In addition to the violence, clinics have been attacked by politicians. In the past 5 years, more than 280 laws have been passed that restrict access to abortion. In Mississippi, a woman can actually be charged for murder if she terminates her pregnancy. The two provisions in the law are Mississippi code section 97-3-17, section 1, and Mississippi Code 97-3-19, section D.

Since there have been FOUR Supreme Court decisions in favor of the ""pro-choice' crows, it seems to me that the Mississippi laws are unconstitutional, so I wrote a letter to the Mississippi chapter of the ACLU a few days ago, and asked them if they had brought suit yet against the state.

If you have the time to read another book about abortion, I would recommend reading ""scarlet A"" by Kaatie Watson, who is a bioethicist at Northwestern's medical school, and a senior counsel for the American Civil Liberties Union of Illinois."
274,5,"Preet Bharara is used to dealing with bullies. When he was the US attorney for the southern district of New York, the premier law enforcement body in America, his office prosecuted Osama bin Laden’s son-in-law, Crips and Bloods gang leaders and mafia bosses. For going after the infamous arms dealer Viktor Bout he was banned from Russia, and the Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan once tried to persuade the then US vice-president, Joe Biden, to sack him (he didn’t). The TV series Billions is loosely based on his legal battles with a hedge-fund billionaire. As he puts it himself: “Neither I nor anyone I know was too afraid to prosecute rich men in suits.”

So when Bharara says that even he is now feeling apprehensive about his personal safety, and that his fears relate not to al-Qaida or the Gambino family, but to the president of the United States, it comes as a jolt. “I used to have great confidence that my government would protect me,” he says. “You understood that if you were an American citizen like me, or resident like Jamal Khashoggi, you weren’t going to be rendered somewhere, you didn’t think that if you travelled to Madrid, say, and a BS red notice was issued for you, you’d be on your own. I’m a citizen of the United States and I served my country for 17 years, yet I don’t have that confidence any more. I don’t know that the government at its highest level thinks of Americans first – it’s whether you are on his side, or not on his side.”

Bharara, 50, has been thinking a lot lately about bullies, and their nemeses – those unsung heroes who strive for what’s right. His first book, Doing Justice: A Prosecutor’s Thoughts on Crime, Punishment and the Rule of Law, takes us back to basics, asking us to reflect on what truth means when a serial liar sits in the Oval Office; what civility involves amid all the social media yelling; and how to uphold the rule of law when thuggish behaviour appears to be the order of the day.

The book is a love letter to the southern district of New York (SDNY) that he led for more than seven years until he was abruptly fired by Donald Trump in March 2017. He praises its spirit of independence – its moniker is “Sovereign District” – and the committed people who work there, such as the “real-life mob-busting cop” Kenny McCabe who took on all five families of the Cosa Nostra.

As one of the earliest law enforcement agencies in the country, its aligned federal court, known as the “mother court”, has sat continuously since 1789, hearing cases from the sinking of the Titanic to the trial of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg as Soviet spies. The reach of SDNY prosecutors is unlimited. When someone asked Bharara recently to define the agency’s jurisdiction, he replied: “Are you familiar with Earth?”

At its most powerful, Doing Justice works as a metaphorical survival guide for the Trump era. As with everything Bharara does, he writes in a tone that is calm and considered, a warm bath after the outrage of Trump’s daily tweets.

That’s what has made him such an unlikely superstar following his dismissal at Trump’s hands. Since he was ousted from the southern district, he has created a hugely popular podcast, Stay Tuned, exploring the intersection between law and politics, and now has more than 1 million followers on Twitter. “Can you imagine! A former prosecutor has a million Twitter followers – it makes no sense,” he says. “I’m told it’s anxiety, but there’s also a desire to learn from those with experience about what’s going on.”

In the hour I spend with Bharara at his podcast offices in Manhattan, he treats me to the same measured analysis. The style of his conversation is soothing, reassuring, but its content is wholly alarming.

It starts with a phone call he received on 9 March 2017. The president of the United States was on the line, he was told, did he want to take it?

Bharara was puzzled. He’d been summoned to meet the president-elect in Trump Tower shortly after the November 2016 election, when Trump had invited him to stay on at the helm of the SDNY.

Before the meeting ended, Trump asked Bharara for his phone number. That struck the lawyer as odd, though he duly wrote it down on a Post-it note. Now, a few weeks after Trump had been anointed, here he was again on the phone and, against protocol, wanting to talk.

Bharara did not pick up. And he did not call back.

It has been two years since then, and Bharara is still at a loss about why Trump called him. He wonders why, the day after the call, he was told to resign, when Trump had specifically requested that he stay on. (Bharara refused to quit, forcing Trump to fire him 48 hours after his unanswered phone call, on 11 March.) More importantly, he asks himself what that call had been about. What had Trump been after?

“Imagine what it would look like now if I were still US attorney and it became known that I had quiet little chats with the president at the same time we were investigating the Trump organisation and Michael Cohen. So I didn’t call back, and it’s one of the best decisions I ever made.”

Bharara has had no interaction with Robert Mueller’s investigation into possible collusion with Russia during the 2016 election, as the special counsel was appointed two months after Bharara was fired. He has watched the inquiry unfold with detachment but increasing agitation.

He sees Trump’s relentless sniping at Mueller as nothing less than a threat to judicial independence. “The incessant cry of ‘witchhunt’, the constant blurring of the line between politics and law enforcement … A particular person in power doesn’t want to be investigated, and wants to get his supporters to doubt the veracity of the result, so he’s undermining people’s faith, in a direct way, in the rule of law.”

That chipping away at public faith in the law, pumped out through Trump’s Twitter feed – “the biggest megaphone of any human being on Earth”, he calls it – leads Bharara to be deeply fearful of what will happen when Mueller completes his report, as he may any day now.

“I have a great fear that no matter what Mueller says – if it’s a devastating indictment of the president or the opposite – one half of the American people won’t accept it.”

How dangerous would that be? “I think it would be terrible,” he says. “If someone like Bob Mueller, who volunteered to go to Vietnam and took a bullet wound, who held high-ranking jobs then chose to take on lowly homicide cases, if someone of that stature can be attacked and you can make tens of millions of Americans think he is a piece of shit, that’s horrifying to me.”

It’s at this point, just as we are reaching full-blown despair, that we return to the subject of the southern district of New York and its fierce spirit of independence. In his book, Bharara takes us through the fundamental principles of justice and truth that motivate the SDNY’s investigators under the agency’s unwritten mantra: “Do the right thing, in the right way, for the right reasons.”

Drawing on his past cases, he teases out good practice for the rookie prosecutor, as though he were preaching to his own younger self when he joined the SDNY in 2000. He spreads words of wisdom along the way. One of his favourite quotes is from Oliver Cromwell: “I beseech ye in the bowels of Christ, think that ye may be mistaken.”

While most of the media has fixated on Mueller, the southern district, motivated by such values, has quietly been compiling a devastating case against Trump all of its own. It is not a random fact that the conviction of Michael Cohen, Trump’s lawyer and fixer, for tax fraud and campaign finance violations relating to the pay-off of the adult film actor Stormy Daniels, was secured not by Mueller but by the SDNY.

Bharara, like most informed observers, thinks it highly unlikely that the SDNY will indict Trump while he is still in office. Though there is nothing in the constitution or in law to stop the SDNY from charging Trump, Department of Justice guidelines bar sitting presidents from being prosecuted, and Bharara does not expect to see his former colleagues “going rogue” in that way.

But when Trump leaves office, all bets are off.

The culture of the SDNY is such that if they feel they have sufficient evidence they will definitely go after him when he leaves the White House. “Right is right, and no one’s above the law. That’s not just lip service – the SDNY is steeped in it. No one is above the law: I don’t care who you are, how much money you have, who your friends are.”

Bharara stresses that he has had no inside intelligence about his old stomping ground since he was fired. But when he detects SDNY activity – the boxes of recordings they seized in raids on Cohen’s home and legal office, for instance – it ignites in him his innate pride and confidence in the “Sovereign District” as a bastion against the forces of darkness. “It seems to me that what the SDNY is doing is pulling on a thread. And when the thread is named Michael Cohen, God knows what other things lie ahead.”

275,5,"News from the legal front is not good for Donald Trump or anyone who had anything to do with his 2016 inaugural committee.



 CNN is reporting that tens of thousands of documents have been turned over in response to a subpoena issued by the SDNY, and that means that prosecutors in that office are clearly on the verge of possibly issuing indictments in the case, which could prove catastrophic for First Lady Melania Trump:

“The end of the document production indicates the investigation is moving into the next stage. Authorities are investigating whether any of the record $107 million in donations for the inaugural was misspent, used to improperly benefit certain individuals, or came from foreign donors in violation of campaign finance laws that prohibit foreign money in US elections, people familiar with the inquiry said.”



 It also appears that one key figure from the Trump inaugural has already been interviewed by federal prosecutors:

Yes, the First Lady herself could be facing federal charges if it can be proven that she directed funds from the inaugural committee be steered to Wolkoff. That would be a direct violation of federal law and could result in charges of fraud being filed against the president’s wife.



 The inaugural committee investigation is a direct result of a recording obtained when federal officials raided the office and residences of President Trump’s personal attorney and fixer, Michael Cohen. The New York Attorney General is also believed to be investigating the inaugural since the Trump Organization is headquartered in the Empire State.

One name that keeps coming up is Imaad Zuberi, CNN notes. He was the only person singled out in the subpoena from the SDNY:

It’s becoming clearer by the day that the Russia investigation was just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to Trump’s legal problems. Considering that he’s allegedly committed endless crimes over the years, there’s certainly no shortage of evidence."
276,5,"Take the case of sick leave. Democratic bills in the Senate and House would make offering paid sick days to employees a requirement of most businesses. With nearly 40 percent of private-sector U.S. workers offered no paid sick leave at all, such a mandate would obviously impact men in the workforce as well as women. But as advocacy groups have discovered, the issue has a greater resonance when cast in terms of working mothers: Why should a woman have to choose between caring for a sick child and earning a day's pay? That kind of framing helped make Connecticut the first state in the U.S. with a paid sick day law on its books in 2011.

Republicans appear to sense some vulnerability on the working-family front. As part of its post-2012 rebranding efforts, the GOP made a big push on its Working Families Flexibility Act, a measure that would loosen overtime laws to allow private-sector workers to take time off rather than pay for the extra hours they work. The measure stands little to no chance of passage in the Senate -- Democrats have killed the proposal twice before, on the grounds that it's ripe for abuse by employers -- but having it on the docket has allowed Republicans to accuse their Democratic colleagues of voting against working moms.

""The minimum wage now isn't enough to do anything,"" Ibanez said. ""You have to buy groceries and food for the children and be able to pay your rent at the end of the month. It's hardly ever enough. I almost never have the luxury of going to name-brand stores to buy the things we need. I'm always bargain-hunting. This is what the minimum wage does to us. We have to live these types of shared lives.""

Rep. Joaquin Castro (D-Texas) is one of those members. He said he and his twin brother were raised by their mother and grandmother, both of whom struggled financially to make ends meet. ""My mom, the year before we went to college, made less than 20,000 that year and was sending two sons off to school,"" he said last week at a press conference on equal pay. ""So I grew up in a household where this issue was very important. As soon as the leader asked me if I'd be part of this press conference, I said yes in honor of my mom."""
277,5,"Though it’s hard to believe now, there was actually a time when Lindsey Graham was one of Donald Trump’s harshest critics. Graham even predicted back in 2016 that if Trump was the GOP nominee, some very bad things were in the cards for Republicans:

Graham also encouraged the late Senator John McCain (R-AZ) to give the infamous Steele dossier to the FBI, Axios notes:



 And yet, this is the very same Lindsey Graham who helped shepherd the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh through the Senate Judiciary Committee, blowing a gasket when committee Democrats dared to raise issues of sexual assault against Kavanaugh, who was eventually confirmed in one of the closest votes in history.

Now Graham is once again in the headlines, defending Donald Trump despite his incriminating call with the Ukrainian president in which he suggested he wouldn’t release military aid until Ukraine dug up dirt on the family of former Vice President Joe Biden.

So what exactly is with Senator Graham? Why is he so eager to protect Trump, no matter what?



 Perhaps it’s time we take another look at some information that came from Jon Cooper of the Democratic Coalition earlier this year. Cooper posted this on Twitter:

No one knows exactly what that “kink” could be, and the very thought of what bizarre things Graham could be involved in boggles the mind and induces nausea.

If anyone would have this information, it’s likely to be Trump, or some of the shady organized crime figures he’s done business with over the years.

Whatever the reason, let’s hope Graham’s secret becomes public knowledge soon, because in a state as conservative as South Carolina, a sex scandal could sink the his chances of re-election to the Senate in November."
278,5,"Despite a billion dollars’ worth of negative press to destroy Trump before he was elected — over 500,000 lying articles claiming that Trump colluded with Russia and the Deep State’s $30-million illegal investigation, Trump has miraculously survived. Incredibly, Trump has stayed on offense, laser-focused on making America great again. The treasonous anti-Trump coalition is frustrated, hatefully consumed with creating Kryptonite to take down this political Superman.

While he has performed like a man of steel, Trump is only human. Ninety-two percent of media reporting on Trump is negative. How much abuse can this man take? It is vitally important that We the People assure President Trump that we have his back. Tea Party Express launching “Tea Party for Trump” is divinely timed.

Sarah Palin was a conservative warrior, an answer to the prayers of Christians, conservatives, and Republicans. I still remember the joy and excitement I felt hearing Sarah Palin’s acceptance speech to run as John McCain’s vice president. Palin was bright, bold, and beautiful, unembarrassed to stand up for principles and values that have made America great.

Immediately after Palin accepted the V.P. nomination, the American left launched a no-holds-barred campaign to destroy her. Palin’s entire family, including her Down syndrome toddler son, were high-tech lynched by fake news media. Every word out of Palin’s mouth was spun to brand her crazy, stupid, or racist.

This is exactly the same tactic Democrats and their minions have used to keep Trump’s approval below 50%. The same way leftists viciously attacked Palin’s family, actor Peter Fonda said Trump’s 12-year-old son should be caged with pedophiles to be gang-raped. Whose family could endure such vile, relentless hate? The American left decreed commenting on Obama’s family out of bounds while declaring it open season on attacking the families of Palin and Trump.

Despite the Mueller Report concluding that Trump did not collude with Russia to steal the presidency from Hillary, NeverTrumps and Republicans maintain a safe distance from Trump, halfheartedly supportive of his America first agenda. Once again, I am reminded of our side’s disloyalty to Sarah Palin.

Making sure that none of the excrement fake news media showered upon Palin splashed on them, conservatives and Republicans distanced themselves from Sarah Palin. Word in conservative and Republican circles was that Palin had become politically toxic. Frustrated, I thought, “So this is how we treat our friends and courageous warriors?”

Trump does not play by any of Washington, D.C. elitists’ rules. Trump drives them nuts.

The assault on Palin pales in comparison to what Democrats, fake news media, Hollywood, NeverTrumps, RINOs, and the Deep State are doing to President Trump. Every day, this man awakens to face a tsunami of media lies, distortions, and the narrative that Americans hate his guts. None of Trump’s remarkable, unprecedented achievements for We the People is reported.

Trump is despised by the American left because he is effectively blocking its mission to transform America away from the vision of our Founding Fathers, rooted in biblical principles. Another reason Trump is despised is because he is a man of the people. Leftists and political elites are shallow, ruled by surface appearances.

For example, New York Times columnist David Brooks absurdly said seeing Obama’s perfectly creased pants told him Obama would be a great president. Obama was a master of what we in the black community describe as “jive talkin.” Whenever Obama gave one of his incomprehensible, rambling answers, his fake news media sycophants were enraptured. They would interpret the brilliance of Obama’s superior intellect to us commoners.

The Bible says, “Man looks on the outward appearance, but the Lord looks on the heart” (1 Samuel 16:7). When Trump speaks, leftists and political elites are appalled. In contrast, We the People see, hear, and connect with Trump’s heart — his love for America and his sincere commitment to serving her best interest.

God has a hedge of protection around Trump. Millions of Christians are praying for him, which I believe is the source of Trump’s remarkable strength, endurance, and focus. Still, Trump is only human. Anti-Trump resisters relentlessly attempt to character-assassinate him 24/7.

Trump needs to hear daily that we appreciate his courage and that we are solidly standing shoulder to shoulder with him. We must help Trump keep America great in 2020.

Why it matters: There are several signs that should give the Trump-is-toast self-assured pause."
281,5,"Book publishers are asking President Donald Trump to reject a proposal for what many are calling a “Bible tax.”

According to CBN News, the proposed tariffs are on $300 billion of Chinese goods and include printed materials, such as Bibles and children’s books, which are made in China. The tariff is about 25 percent.

Bloomberg reports that those materials are printed in China because of “the unique paper, printing technology and skills needed.”

During a hearing this week, however, companies and trade groups that would be impacted by the proposed tariffs ask the U.S. International Trade Commission to reconsider the tariffs.

Mark Schoenwald, the chief executive officer of HarperCollins Christian Publishing, attended the hearing.

“We believe the administration was unaware of the potential negative impact these proposed tariffs would have on Bibles and that it never intended to impose ‘a Bible tax’ on consumers and religious organizations,” Schoenwald said.

He added that the tariff would impact the entire publishing market.

In response to the tariff, publishers would have to raise their prices. CBN News also said Christian booksellers, ministries and churches would face the new challenges.

“If tariffs are imposed, there will be fewer books available to American kids,” said Daniel Reynolds, CEO of Workman Publishing Co. in New York.

He said production could not move to another country because China uses materials that other countries do not have.

M. Luisa Simpson, vice president of global policy at the Association of American Publishers, said at the hearing that American publishers do not have the capacity for production and profit margins are low.

Stan Jantz, head of the Evangelical Christian Publishers Association, said he hoped Trump would reconsider the tariff.

“I know there’s a great interest in the area of religious freedom and access to religious goods on the part of the administration,’’ Jantz said after he gave his testimony to the panel. “We do hope that there would be an openness and strong consideration for Bibles in particular and also for books.’’"
282,5,"Nationwide raids to arrest thousands of members of undocumented families have been scheduled to begin Sunday, according to two current and one former homeland security officials, moving forward with a rapidly changing operation, the final details of which remain in flux. The operation, backed by President Trump, had been postponed, partly because of resistance among officials at his own immigration agency.

The raids, which will be conducted by Immigration and Customs Enforcement over multiple days, will include “collateral” deportations, according to the officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the preliminary stage of the operation. In those deportations, the authorities might detain immigrants who happened to be on the scene, even though they were not targets of the raids.

When possible, family members who are arrested together will be held in family detention centers in Texas and Pennsylvania. But because of space limitations, some might end up staying in hotel rooms until their travel documents can be prepared. ICE’s goal is to deport the families as quickly as possible.

The officials said ICE agents were targeting at least 2,000 immigrants who have been ordered deported — some as a result of their failure to appear in court — but who remain in the country illegally. The operation is expected to take place in at least 10 major cities."
284,5,"Working with a faith-based coalition, Kenny Alphin of country duo Big & Rich met with six U.S. Senators this past week. They spoke on behalf of people worldwide facing extreme hunger.

“I want to make a difference even in the smallest way. I’m only one person, but I can feel it working…""

As half of country duo Big & Rich, “Big” Kenny Alphin sings their hit song “That’s Why I Pray” on stages across the country night after night. On June 20, he put the sentiment into action when he joined a coalition of faith leaders on a mission to Capitol Hill. They met with leaders in six Senate offices to advocate for global nutrition funding in U.S. foreign aid.

“I'm grateful that you may know my voice for singing songs,” said Alphin in a statement. “I'm even more grateful to use it to speak on behalf of our fellow brothers and sisters who are suffering from hunger and malnutrition.”Since their debut in 2004, when they won Best New Artist honors at the Billboard Music Awards, Big & Rich have been a staple on Top 40 radio.

The Faith-Based Coalition for Global Nutrition represents the collective voice of more than 250 evangelical pastors, recording artists, and nonprofit leaders. Members include Gospel Music Association president Jackie Patillo, recording artist Michael W. Smith, and Dr. David Stevens, CEO of the Christian Medical and Dental Associations.

Longtime global health leader Jenny Eaton Dyer, Ph.D., previously affiliated with The ONE Campaign founded by Bono of British rock band U2, directs the group’s advocacy efforts.

“I was excited when Big Kenny was able to make time during his tour schedule to come and join us this past week,” said Dyer in a recent phone interview. “We are in an emergency moment in several countries right now. Last year alone, this funding through USAID served over 22 million children—really, it saved their lives.”

Current efforts of the coalition are focused on ensuring that nutrition is fully funded in the Fiscal Year 2020 federal budget. The House passed the State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs funding bill on May 16, and that bill is currently being debated in the Senate.

A report released last fall by several world health agencies surprised many observers. For the third year in a row, the number of undernourished people in the world has risen. It’s a fact that coalition members had at the ready when meeting with the offices of Senators Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.), Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-Miss.), James Lankford (R-Okla.), Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.), Roger Wicker (R-Miss.), and Todd Young (R-Ind.).

“Over the past couple years, we’ve seen some of the largest famines worldwide since the 1980s,” said Dyer, who teaches religion and global health courses at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tenn. “From North Africa to the Middle East, there are currently about 52 million people on the brink of famine, suffering with chronic undernourishment.”

Contrary to popular understanding, she explained that famine does not result solely from drought. War and social unrest also break down a community’s capacity to flourish. “Famine is often manmade, with conflict being the key variable,” added Dyer. “Around these conflict states, you find lack of access to resources for the population which include food and clean water.”

Such pronounced needs compel Christians broadly to affirm the coalition’s response, including at the conservative-leaning Institute on Religion & Democracy (IRD) in Washington, D.C.

“Christians should desire for governments to do justice,” stated IRD president Mark Tooley via e-mail. “For religious groups to urge government to spend more to alleviate human suffering, there’s nothing objectionable about such an initiative. Governments obviously have an important role.”

The series of meetings on Friday marked the first advocacy trip to Capitol Hill for singer/musician Alphin, though he has long spoken out for the impoverished in South Sudan and Haiti. While his Top 40 hits often mention Christian faith, the Nashville celebrity has not publicly discussed his church affiliation.

In February 2017, when Alphin’s father died at age 86, he shared of his faith heritage. “If you ever got to hear him pray, there was no doubt his heart was pure,” Alphin wrote on Facebook, in tribute to his father. “His faith was as strong as any and his kindness and compassion for others ran deep… He showed us what it meant to live an exemplary life of service to God, family, and community.”

The Faith-Based Coalition for Global Nutrition, an initiative of The 2030 Collaborative founded by Dyer, has elevated the country star’s voice in new spheres. “Big Kenny has played an integral part in philanthropy and issue awareness,” said Dyer. “For years, he has championed education for girls, emergency relief funding, and fighting poverty.”

When navigating issues of partisan politics, the country duo has attempted to walk the line.

During the 2017 inauguration of President Donald Trump, several major recording artists opted not to accept the invitation. Yet Big & Rich, comprised of Alphin and John Rich, said they considered it an honor to headline a D.C.-area gala hosted by the Great America Alliance.

Now Alphin has joined a coalition somewhat at odds with the Trump administration. The faith-based collective advocates for nutrition funding to reach $175 million, an increase of $30 million from current levels. However, the Presidential budget recommended global nutrition be cut to $79 million.

“This is some of the most effective funding spent in our national budget,” said Dyer. “We understand concerns around budget deficits, but this is not the place to cut. Foreign aid represents less than one percent of the U.S. budget, and it is saving the lives of literally millions of people.”

For the Capitol Hill meetings, Dyer and Alphin were joined by coalition members Matthew Boulton, former president of Christian Theological Seminary in Indianapolis, Ind.; Doug Severn, senior pastor of City Pres Church in Oklahoma City, Okla.; and Rita Wray, founder of Wray Enterprises and a community organizer from Jackson, Miss.

USAID reports that 76 million people received assistance last year through its food programs. For years Dyer and her longtime collaborator, former Senator Bill Frist (R-Tenn.), have documented the cost-effectiveness of foreign aid.

Yet it raises questions for some, about whether the church rather than government should be leading in international relief efforts.

“Churches don’t seek to replace government, but do have a distinct message that government cannot replicate,” said Tooley, whose group founded in 1981 provides analysis on policy issues to diverse evangelical leaders. “The church’s chief focus should be on how Christians can directlyalleviate human suffering in witness to Christ. That message inevitably is obscured when church groups instead focus on secular humanitarian outreach.”

A native of Nashville, Dyer speaks often to local congregations where she answers objections to Christian involvement in advocacy for public funding of relief work.

“As Christians, we should be praying and giving to nonprofits, and to our churches that do work locally and globally” she said. “Then our government is able to tackle some extreme poverty issues like hunger. That requires expertise, funding, and infrastructure at a level the church doesn’t quite have the ability to do.”

According to a 2017 report from the World Health Organization, nearly one in three people worldwide suffer from at least one form of malnutrition. At a time when some leaders urge pulling back from international relief efforts, the Faith-Base Coalition for Global Nutriton has committed to address this issue.

They have united based on their shared faith values. “We are called to lift up the widow, the orphan, and the refugee,” said Dyer. “There are over 2,000 Scripture verses urging us to help those who are hungry and living in poverty. We really need political will and sustained effort to achieve these goals, which have been reset for 2030.”

Having seen Scriptures used in service of various political causes, the president of the Institute on Religion & Democracy urges modesty when applying particular verses to current policies.

“Bible verses don’t necessarily command specific government actions,” stated Tooley. “What the Bible does command is the church’s evangelistic mission, for which secular humanitarianism is no substitute.”

For Kenny Alphin, he often lets music do the talking for him. Released in 2012, Big & Rich’s hit song “That’s Why I Pray” hinted as his drive for advocacy years before he visited Capitol Hill. “People ’cross the world holding on,” he sings. “The earth caved in, the ocean came down crashing… Out of everything we can create.”

Today, Alphin has hope that believers with common cause can help solve difficult problems.

“I'm excited that we can all make a difference for the hungry,” he says. “Can I get an Amen?""

285,5,FACT CHECK: Did Sally Yates Lie During DNC Speech? We discuss this and more on today's show.
286,5,"Much like his father-in-law, White House adviser Jared Kushner struggles with telling the truth when he’s asked about his activities, meetings, business deals, or just about anything else, and that proclivity for lying has landed him in some very hot water legally.

You probably recall that Kushner was unable to get a top secret security clearance because he had too many business connections to countries such as Russia, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates, which made him vulnerable to blackmail or manipulation by those nations.



 Part of Jared’s paperwork to receive a security clearance (which was later granted to him unilaterally by President Donald Trump over the objections of top intelligence officials) is a form known as SF-86, which is a questionnaire in which a government official lists all of his contacts with foreign officials. Kushner had to repeatedly revise his SF-86 because (oops!) he forgot to disclose meetings with the former Russian ambassador, some bigwigs who control Russian banks, and that infamous meeting with Russian nationals held at Trump Tower in June of 2016 to get “dirt” on Hillary Clinton.



 As a result of his failure to tell the truth on his security clearance form, two Democratic members of Congress have referred Kushner’s case to the Department of Justice for criminal charges. One of those Congressmen, Don Beyer (D-CA), posted his letter to the DOJ on Twitter:

Granted, the likelihood that Attorney General William Barr will allow Kushner to be prosecuted is remote, but that doesn’t get him off the hook when it comes to being charged and indicted, because a new attorney general in a new, Democratic administration can still bring those charges against Jared.



 Additionally, the state of New York may also be able to charge Kushner for that Trump Tower meeting and other related crimes associated with his business dealings, which are headquartered in the state. And that could mean a long prison sentence for Jared.

So while Kushner and other members of the Trump family may have managed to wriggle out of trouble in the Mueller investigation, karma is far from finished with them.

In other words, Jared might want to start thinking about finding a country that doesn’t have an extradition treaty with the United States for his next vacation."
287,5,"The Center for Military Readiness has reviewed and analyzed amendments to the National Defense Authorization Act that the House Rules Committee approved for consideration on the floor today. We urge CHQ readers and friends to call their Representative (the toll-free Capitol Switchboard is 1-866-220-0044), tell your Representative the American military is not the place for Leftwing social engineering and demand that your Representative vote NO on the following amendments.

The following amendments to the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for FY 2020 were approved by the Rules Committee for consideration on the floor of the House.

Comments below analyze the proposed amendments, described in quotes from the Rules Committee list, beginning with ones of greatest concern to the Center for Military Readiness:

 

 Amendment # 399 SPEIER (CA) et al. OPPOSE

“Requires that qualifications for eligibility to serve in an armed force account only for the ability of an individual to meet gender-neutral occupational standards and not include any criteria relating to the race, color, national origin, religion, or sex (including gender identity or sexual orientation) of an individual.”

 

 Comment: Approval of the Speier amendment in both Houses would justify a veto of the NDAA, due to both unintended and intended consequences. Would serve as grounds to eliminate virtually all enlistment requirements, provided that a person meets “gender-neutral occupational standards.” Would also reverse the Trump/Mattis Policy regarding transgender personnel, even though that policy is not based on gender identity and it does not bar enlistment or retention of transgenders as a class. The policy is based on a medical condition, gender dysphoria, which affects personal readiness to deploy and other factors.

 

 As stated in CMR’s June 27 news release, the Speier amendment calls for universal application in all personnel policies. Enactment in law would a) Put the Congress on record in favor of the unscientific notion that gender is “designated” or “assigned” at birth. even though human DNA determines gender long before birth; b) Force medical personnel to provide controversial hormone or surgical treatments that many consider unethical; c) Allow biological males to share female-only private facilities; d) Violate religious liberties; e) Eliminate female-only athletic teams, f) Force the use of pronouns inconsistent with biological sex; g) Increase non-deployability and associated morale problems; h) Impose higher costs for medical visits, i) Increase already-high rates of suicide; and j) Harm recruiting and retention in the All-Volunteer Force.

 

 Amendment #41 POCAN (WI) - OPPOSE

“Requires review of the discharge characterizations of former members of the military who were discharged because of their sexual orientation. Requires boards to change discharge characterizations from dishonorable to honorable in such cases.”

 

 Comment: The amendment is unnecessary because the law already provides for this; Discharge Review Boards (DRBs) have operated for years. No one in the history of our military has ever received a dishonorable discharge “because of their sexual orientation.” ""Being"" a homosexual was not a crime under the UCMJ. Persons engaging in homosexual conduct who were court-martialed and given a Dishonorable Discharge were convicted by proof beyond a reasonable doubt of some punitive offense under the UCMJ. All have had appellate rights available to them to challenge their convictions under the UCMJ and then to bring a collateral attack in the Federal Courts if they claimed their constitutional rights were violated.

 

 Amendment #214 LAWRENCE (MI) -- OPPOSE

“States that the Secretary of Defense shall require each of the military departments to examine successful strategies in use by foreign military services to recruit and retain women, and to consider potential best practices for implementation in the United States Armed Forces, as recommended by the Defense Advisory Committee on Women in the Services.”

 

 Comment: Some foreign militaries (which rely on America’s defense security umbrella) operate under decided to gender-integrate their all-male direct ground combat units to promote “equal opportunity,” not military readiness, but America’s military must assign priority to mission readiness and combat lethality. Reviews of practices in other countries fail to consider priorities and practices used in the militaries of potential adversaries.

 

 Amendment #222 OMAR (MN) - OPPOSE

“Specifies that the DoD plan for diversity in hiring, promotion, and retention should include plans for hiring, promoting, and retaining racial minorities, women, religious minorities, immigrants, members of the LGBTI+ community, and people with disabilities.”

 

 Comment: This would lead to quotas for various minority groups which the Supreme Court has held are unconstitutional. Currently, officer promotion boards have to be very careful to further diversity ""goals"" without slipping over into ""quotas,"" which this amendment seems to demand.

 

 Amendment #129 BROWN (MD) – NOT NECESSARY

“Directs the Secretary of Defense to produce a report on the number of certain waivers received by transgender individuals.” 

 

 Comment: Data can be useful for many purposes, but there are many disqualifying conditions that can be waived. If there is a need to evaluate military waivers, ALL conditions, not just waivers for transgenders or persons diagnosed with gender dysphoria, should be considered.

289,5,"There is Nothing Tolerant About Killing the Weak and the Helpless.

Tolerance in its highest and purest form is simply love—love for those who are different, contrary and inconvenient. To love liberally is to tolerate abundantly! Tolerance is not agreement; it is grace—towards those who slight you, contradict you and generally inconvenience you. For the sake of peace, tolerance puts the interests of others first—which is something abortion knows nothing of. Abortion is the antithesis of tolerance. Don’t be deceived, there is nothing tolerant about sentencing your own child to death. And there is nothing noble in “tolerating” violent injustice."
290,5,"Back in April, former Vice President Joe Biden lied to the American people by falsely claiming that the Obama administration had been devoid of a single “whisper of scandal.”

Three months later, the 2020 contender has “upgraded” of sorts from simply lying about the Obama administration to now, amazingly enough, touting the administration’s own lies (of which there were many).

Case in point: Speaking at an AARP event in Iowa on Monday, the former partner in crime of America’s 44th president, Barack Hussein Obama, repeated nearly verbatim one of Obama’s most notorious lies.

“How many of you like your employer-based healthcare? Did you think it was adequate? If I come along and say finish, you can’t have it anymore — well, that’s what Medicare-for-All does,” he said.

“You cannot have it, period. … So I’d leave people the option. If you like your health care plan, your employer-based plan, you can keep it. If in fact you have private insurance, you can keep it.”

The former VP had been defending his healthcare vision for America — which calls for “fixing” Obama’s Affordable Care Act (aka Obamacare) — by blasting his 2020 opponents’ healthcare plans, the vast majority of which call for implementing Medicare-for-All.

Were his opponents’ radical plans implemented, private insurance would indeed disappear, meaning that nobody would be allowed to keep their employer-based plan.

Biden clearly was hoping to ding his opponents Monday by highlighting this fact. The error he made however was in trying to highlight it by repeating Obama’s most notorious lie.

Prior to the implementation of the ACA, then-President Obama repeatedly promised the American people, “If you like your health care plan, you can keep it.” Except this promise turned out to be such a whopper of a lie that it was rated the “Lie of the Year of 2013” by PolitiFact.

“It was a catchy political pitch and a chance to calm nerves about his dramatic and complicated plan to bring historic change to America’s health insurance system. … But the promise was impossible to keep,” the left-wing fact-checking website ruled in late 2013.

“So this fall, as cancellation letters were going out to approximately 4 million Americans, the public realized Obama’s breezy assurances were wrong.”

“Boiling down the complicated health care law to a soundbite proved treacherous, even for its promoter-in-chief. Obama and his team made matters worse, suggesting they had been misunderstood all along. The stunning political uproar led to this: a rare presidential apology.’

“For all of these reasons, PolitiFact has named ‘If you like your health care plan, you can keep it,’ the Lie of the Year for 2013.”

That Biden would repeat one of Obama’s own lies — and only months after he himself had lied to the American people — points to a level of incompetence that’s difficult to fathom. It’s as if he’s too old and senile, or perhaps just too egotistical, to realize how he sounds to the American people.

And this comes only weeks after every candidate on stage — including Biden — raised their hand at the second Democrat presidential primary debate in late June after the moderators asked those candidates who support providing healthcare to illegal aliens to raise their hands.

This matters because it was Obama who claimed during a speech to Congress in 2009 that the ACA — the same healthcare plan Biden is now pushing (albeit in its “fixed” form) — would not lead to illegals obtaining healthcare insurance.

“There are also those who claim that our reform effort will insure illegal immigrants. This, too, is false – the reforms I’m proposing would not apply to those who are here illegally,” Obama had said.

At the time, then-Republican Rep. Joe Wilson attracted widespread, bipartisan criticism for interrupting this portion of the speech to yell, “You lie!”

Yet exactly ten years later, Biden rushed to raise his hand when asked about the prospect of providing healthcare to illegal aliens. This seems to point to yet another lie.

So does what the former VP said to CNN earlier this month.

“I think undocumented people need to have a means by which they can be covered when they’re sick,” he said at the time to network host Chris Cuomo. “And so the idea is that’s what I think we should be doing by building more clinics around the country. Not just for undocumented, for other people when they’re ill, when they’re sick. People need — this is just common decency.”

So which is it? Do illegals get healthcare, or do they not? And do the American people get to keep their current healthcare plan, or don’t they? Or is it possible that, much like with Obamacare, nobody will get to find out the truth until Biden’s plan is (if ever) actually signed into law?"
291,5,"Hillary Clinton extending an olive branch to loyal Obama supporters by choosing to keep Vice President Biden on her ticket in would all but guarantee her winning the Presidency in November.

Think about it for a second. What other person has the approval rating, name recognition, and proven loyalty to the Commander-in-Chief than Vice President Biden? He is beloved by Democrats across the ideological divide and hasn't tried to steal the show by being a rival to President Obama. Instead, he has relished in his role as #2 and has shown that he will always put country over his own ambitions.

Here's five reasons why I think Secretary Clinton would be wise to pick Vice President Biden as her running mate.

Sure, Secretary Clinton can go for a flashy newcomer to the political scene that will excite this or that group in the Democratic Party and no one could blame her for doing so. Picking a Latin American or Asian American as her running mate will undoubtedly be exciting not just for those groups, but for the entire party.

One of the issues with this scenario is that Clinton runs the risk of being outshone by her VP and wind up dampening some of the excitement of her being the first female President in American history. Picking Biden negates that risk entirely. He would be a loyal adviser and confidant to Clinton while shying away from the spotlight.

Biden would also give Clinton advice without preconditions. He isn't interested in being President, so Clinton would never have to worry about him giving advice that would wind up suiting him politically while hurting her.

It's hard to overstate how wildly popular Joe Biden is among Democratic voters. He has a deft understanding of the 'common man' Democrat while also leading the charge in the 1990's in passing 'The Violence Against Women Act.'

People can tell he's speaking from the heart whenever he talks and not just saying what he or his advisers think people want to hear. He also happens to have one of the highest approval ratings of a Vice President in modern American history.

In this time of hyper partisanship, having someone who has a working relationship with members on both sides of the aisle could go a long way. Vice President Biden has been the point man in negotiating with Congress throughout President Obama's tenure and his expertise could go a long way in a Clinton Administration.

Congressional Democrats and Republicans alike respect and admire Biden and his many years in Congress helped him forge relationships that have helped bridge the ideological divide. An unknown Vice President will have to work hard to get that trust and that could wind up hurting Clinton's chances of getting anything of major importance done during her tenure.

4. Biden Will Won't Need Any Training Wheels

Vice President Biden knows what he's doing and won't have to take any time getting used to the job. He knows what's going on throughout the world and is privy to many of the top secret things that are done in the name of keeping Americans safe. He has been involved in every decision from killing Osama Bin Laden to navigating General Motors out of bankruptcy. He knows how to do his job and how to do it well.

5. Biden Can Bring in Democrats Who Aren't 100% With Clinton

It's not a secret that many Obama most ardent supporters are the biggest of fans of Secretary Clinton. What better way to bridge that divide than bringing in Vice President Biden as her running mate? It would bring the Democratic Party together at a time it desperately needs to in order to beat Donald J. Trump in November.

The number one goal of this election is to stop Donald J Trump from being the 45th President of the United States. A unified Democratic Party will be able to make that a reality if we join forces and bring together Hillary Clinton and Joe Biden as our nominees for President and Vice President."

293,5,"Are We Ready For An Implant That Can Change Our Moods?

Our thoughts and fears, movements and sensations all arise from the electrical blips of billions of neurons in our brain. Streams of electricity flow through neural circuits to govern these actions of the brain and body, and some scientists think that many neurological and psychiatric disorders may result from dysfunctional circuits.

As this understanding has grown, some scientists have asked whether we could locate these faulty circuits, reach deep into the brain and nudge the flow to a more functional state, treating the underlying neurobiological cause of ailments like tremors or depression.

The idea of changing the brain for the better with electricity is not new, but deep brain stimulation takes a more targeted approach than the electroconvulsive therapy introduced in the 1930s. DBS seeks to correct a specific dysfunction in the brain by introducing precisely timed electric pulses to specific regions. It works by the action of a very precise electrode that is surgically inserted deep in the brain and typically controlled by a device implanted under the collarbone. Once in place, doctors can externally tailor the pulses to a frequency that they hope will fix the faulty circuit.

The FDA has only approved deep brain stimulation for a handful of conditions, including movement disorders — dystonia, essential tremor and symptoms of Parkinson's disease — and a type of treatment-resistant epilepsy. Now, many scientists in the U.S. and around the globe are experimenting with the technology for psychiatric conditions like depression or obsessive-compulsive disorder.

The results of clinical studies so far are very mixed: Some patients say they have been totally transformed while others feel no effect at all, or they get worse.

Yet research continues and the technology's potential to instantly and powerfully change mood raises ethical, social and cultural questions. NPR spoke to neuroethicist, James Giordano, chief of the Neuroethics Studies Program at Georgetown University Medical Center, about this new technology and its potential benefits and harms when used for psychiatric treatment. In addition to his work at Georgetown, Giordano has consulted with the U.S. military about these technologies and their possible use.

This interview includes answers from two separate conversations with Giordano, one conducted by Alix Spiegel and one by Jonathan Lambert. It has been edited for clarity and length.

What is deep brain stimulation and how does it work?

Scientists have been stimulating brains for a while now, but it has historically been quite crude. A neurosurgeon [would] touch a brain area with an electrode, and see what happened, what types of functions were affected. But we didn't have a detailed picture of what we wanted to target in the brain, and the electrodes themselves were not very precise.

Now we have a much more detailed map of the networks and nodes of neurons involved in different pathologies [like Parkinson's, obsessive-compulsive disorder, etc.] or different thought patterns or emotions. Deep brain stimulation provides a fairly specific and very precise way to utilize electrodes to deliver electrical current in and around a small set of brain cells to turn them on or modulate their activity.

Modify the circuit, and you can modify the behavior. The goal is to use DBS to modify the circuits in such a way as to improve symptoms in a very specific and precise way.

How do you know what kinds of specific inputs you want the electrode to a deliver, and where in the brain to deliver them?

There's an old adage in brain science: ""When you've seen one brain, you've seen one brain."" This is certainly true, but all brains have a lot of similarity on which individual variation is built because brain structures are changed and developed as a consequence of experience.

So when implanting a device, we know generally where we're going, but because the patient is awake while we're implanting the device, we can further tailor it to know where precisely to put it for the desired effect. More fine-tuning, in terms of the kind of stimulation to provide, can be done after surgery, because the device can be tuned externally.

Though it's not yet FDA approved for them, there is ongoing research on treating psychiatric disorders with DBS? What is the research finding so far?

Many studies are certainly finding evidence that DBS can be effective for treating disorders like Tourette's syndrome, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and even depression. Patients are reporting a reduction in the symptoms, but we certainly still have many questions that need answering. For example, when do we treat with DBS? Early in the development of a disorder? Later, after other options have been exhausted? These are questions that still need answering.

How would you explain the difference between how an antidepressants affects the brain and how deep brain stimulation works?

A drug like Prozac or antidepressant drugs is basically like throwing water on your face to get a drink of water. Using something like deep brain stimulation is like putting a drop of water on your tongue. We can increase the specificity and precision ... and, in many ways, the precision and specificity of deep brain stimulation makes it a more effective tool. It can be turned on and turned off. It can be adjusted in the very short term so it can be a more flexible tool that allows a much more precise control of mood.

And compared with antidepressants, are there differences in moral or ethical implications in the use of a treatment that allows us to act so specifically on mood?

Specificity is power. And the moral obligation that comes with great power is overwhelming. The responsibility to understand as best as conceivably possible what you're doing not only on a neurobiological level, but also on an existential and even social level. What are you doing? Are you creating new normal [in terms of mood]? And if you're creating new normal, do we have what I'll call ""the ethical equipment"" on board to be able to address this? In some cases I think the answer is yes, but I think in other cases what you're going to begin to see is that new ethical principles may need to be developed because of the potential and reality of the way these things are being used.

For example, expressive creativity. Is there an ethical principle of self-creativity ... that I can define myself and say I want to create myself in these ways?

Do you mean, theoretically, in the future, you could go to a doctor and say I want to be a great artist?

Now we're not quite to that point, but I could certainly go to a physician and say I want to be more outgoing, I want to be less inhibited. I'd like to be happier on a daily basis. I'd like to feel more enlightened in my daily experiences ... In an open society, are we saying that one should be able to define 'I want to be this' and this is a tool to get there? Perhaps, but then we also have to balance that. What about others? ... This gets back to a question of fairness. Can everybody get this? Who's going to get this?

What can go wrong with this technology? What should we be worried about?

Well, it is neurosurgery, and there are certainly risks that go along with that, infection, problems with the procedure. Targets could be missed or misidentified. Those are risks that come with the territory.

But there are some more cases more specific to DBS. What if you get effects that you didn't anticipate? By stimulating Area X, it's possible that we could get a spillover effect that modulates other things ancillary to that, like personality, temperament, character, personal preferences. There have been case reports and anecdotal reports of things like that happening, but they're rare.

So could implanting a DBS device have some unanticipated consequences for our tastes or personal characteristics like introversion and extroversion?

One of the better-known cases, for example, was a person whose musical taste had nothing to do with country music. And after a deep brain implant for a movement disorder, [the person] developed a real pathos for Johnny Cash music and was just totally into the aesthetic of Johnny Cash. Is it possible for these things to occur? Of course, it is. The brain works as a coordinated set of nodes and networks that are intercommunicative and reciprocal. So changing the local field electrical activity in one area isn't necessarily going to be completely discrete from the wiring, if you will, of the kind of activities and the functions of other brain areas. These things occurring up- and down-stream represent real effects.

Can treatment with a DBS device change more than just our mood, but also our personality?

Yes, although we have to ask ourselves whether those changes are due to the positive consequences of DBS. If someone with Tourette's was an introvert, and then they get a DBS implant and become more of an extrovert and more socially engaged, is this a side effect of the DBS? Or because they're no longer bearing the burden of being someone with a constant verbal tic?

DBS also raises questions of personal autonomy. Are we going to get cases of people saying ""my deep brain stimulator made me do it""? Perhaps. But very often patients report that the condition they had which DBS is treating impaired their autonomy more than they feel the deep brain stimulation is.

What guidance would you give doctors working with DBS in a patient? Because they can affect the state of someone's mood by the levels of the electrical current in the device, how do they know what level to set?

To the point of clinically relevant therapeutic improvement. Just as one would set for example the levels that one could use through any other therapy, [like] cognitive behavioral therapy. Is the person functional? Are they saying, ""yes I feel better, my mood is better."" The same would be true of a drug, however this is more powerful because you're directly affecting those nodes and networks that appear to be some substrate of the thing that causes this person's mood. So you want to be cautious. The general tenor in the field is start low and go slow.

Beyond DBS, where this might this technology ultimately go?

There is a do-it-yourself market if you will, for not deep brain stimulation but transcranial electrical stimulation. What that's showing is that there is an increased interest in neurotechnologies that are not just oriented toward alleviating a medical condition but that change key aspects of cognition, emotions and behavior. This is sometimes referred to as the cosmetic use or designer use of neurotechnology. [If] I don't like key aspects of personality, [such as being shy], could I modify that for example through the use of these neuro technologies? Those things are coming and it's not in the near future — there's interest now.

What pitfalls do we face if this technology becomes more widely used?

Mistakes will get made. Hopefully, we'll be bright enough to correct them and recognize them when they occur not only in terms of the technological and scientific mistakes but ethical, moral, legal mistakes. In many ways, this represents something of a brave new world of capability. And I think that we have to be very, very sentinel to what the potential of this could yield. Yeah this could yield some really wonderful things but also, along with that, if it's used for cosmetic purposes like self-enhancement, could this lead to potentially violent outcomes? I can guarantee you that things that are at very, very problematic and, in some cases, devastating will occur. Do I believe that the net effect will be beneficial because we will respond appropriately to those mistakes that we make? Yeah that's my hope. Do I know that we will? I don't know."

In large measure, these are the defining characteristics of abortion-vulnerable children. Oftentimes, they are not just fatherless, they have fathers who are actively pursuing their demise. Do we dare ignore their plight?!"
297,5,"It didn't take a long for Congress to realize that the 18th amendment was a huge mistake. Officially, prohibition started on January 17, 1920, exactly 98 years ago last Wednesday. It was repealed by the 21st amendment on December 5, 1933.

The guy who benefited the most from Prohibition was Al Capone, who was worth as much as $1.3 billion (in today's dollars) at the height of his ""empire"". However, he wasn't the only one who benefited. Here are a few quick facts:

During the first 13 years of Prohibition, the government appointed 17,971 people to the Prohibition Bureau. Ultimately, 13,588 were fined for bribery, extortion, theft, falsification, conspiracy, forgery, or perjury.

Convictions for liquor offenses rose from 35,000 in 1923 to 60,000 in 1932.

It is estimated that there were between 200,000 and 500,000 speakeasies in the United States.

In 1928, it is estimated that doctors had netted nearly $40,000,000 by writing prescriptions for whiskey.

Today, Jeff Sessions would like to reverse the decisions by a few states to legalize marijuana, which should remind us AGAIN how foolish it was to prohibit liquor a long time ago. Today's version of AL Capone is Pablo Escobar, who was worth an estimated $30 billion in the early 1990's (roughly $56 billion in today's dollars). The ""war on drugs"" has been a HUGE success for people, but a disaster for most of us.

Go home , Jeff. We don't need your advice."

It's worthwhile to set aside some time, and read as much of it as you can. Trump, naturally, would call it all ""fake news"", but it is very obvious that it is anything but."

300,9,"Top treatments, new breakthroughs, education and lifestyle changes are winning the battle against heart disease

In the not-so-distant past, patients suffering from heart disease had a very different experience than patients do today. As recently as a couple decades ago, heart attack patients were likely admitted to a hospital’s coronary care unit where doctors could monitor the patient but didn’t have a lot of options when it came to saving the heart muscle, according to Kirit Patel, M.D., medical director of the cardiac catheterization lab and chief of division of cardiology at St. Joseph Mercy Oakland.

“Twenty-five to 30 years ago there were no stents available and we didn’t even know to give aspirin to heart attack patients,” Patel says. “Now, patients have angioplasty or stents and go home the next day. That’s how fast technology has moved.”

Today – although angioplasty, stents and other artery-opening procedures are still widely used – cardiovascular treatment has changed, with more of a focus on advanced minimally invasive procedures that have transformed heart disease from a possible death sentence to a treatable condition that patients live with for years.

“[In the past,] treatment was driven by coronary artery blockages. Emergency procedures, angiograms, stents and open-heart surgery were 85 percent of what we did,” says William W. O’Neill, M.D., medical director of the Center for Structural Heart Disease at the Henry Ford Heart and Vascular Institute. “The good news is the epidemic is abating and we are seeing fewer heart attacks. We have patients now with coronary artery disease who are relatively stable.”

That means doctors are treating older patients – even in their 90s – and seeing conditions that used to be somewhat rare become more prominent.

“We are seeing more patients with atrial fibrillation, a condition that one-third of those over the age of 80 have,” O’Neill says. “There’s also more valvular disease because as we age, our valves wear out. There used to be a lot of open-heart surgeries, but now there are a wide variety of ways to fix the heart without open-heart surgery. That’s where it’s at now.”

Those in the medical profession expect research and technology will continue to move at a rapid pace, according to Tom Davis, M.D., medical director for cardiovascular research and the cardiac catheterization labs at St. John Hospital and Medical Center.

“We are reinventing ourselves every five years,” Davis says. “Everything I do today is completely different than when I started in 1993.”

Davis says he expects to see a continued push to minimally invasive strategies to treat heart patients.

“I expect soon we will see more heart surgeries done in an outpatient setting,” he says. “There will be shorter procedures and the patient will go home the same day.”

O’Neill says regenerating heart muscles with stem cell therapy and tissue engineering, where parts such as valves will be individually made using 3D models, are also on the horizon.

“This is not science fiction or something that is light years away,” he says. “It’s very realistic that we will see these procedures 10 years from now.”

A new class of LDL-cholesterol-lowering drugs called PCSK9 inhibitors, which don’t have the side effects of statins, will also be a game-changer, O’Neill says. Though the injectable drug is quite expensive – about $14,000 for a one-year supply – and only currently FDA-approved for those with familial hypercholesterolemia, a genetic condition that causes up to three times the normal level of LDL cholesterol, and certain patients who require more lowering of LDL than they are getting with statins, O’Neill says he expects all that to change in the near future.

“These drugs can dramatically lower cholesterol,” he says. “If there is widespread use, we will see coronary artery disease disappear from society.”

302,9,"The classic seaside town of Daytona Beach has an iconic vibe, a longstanding motorsports heritage, and a surprising array of new offerings.

But beyond its miles of sparkling beaches and NASCAR epicenter are glories like new cultural museums, accommodations, parks, attractions and more.

And since JetBlue is adding daily nonstop service from JFK to Daytona Beach starting January 7, 2016, now’s the perfect time to plan a dreamy long weekend.

Accommodations span a large spectrum on Daytona Beach — from rustic campgrounds and casual one-of-a-kind motels to popular chain motels and luxury vacation suites.

If you’re drawn to the perks of a luxury beach hotel (saltwater pool, spa, kid’s amenities), check into The Shores Resort & Spa, a 4-diamond property on the beach. Each of the 212 rooms has a view of the ocean, the beach, or the Intracoastal.

There’s plenty of Floridian charm to be had in charming nearby New Smyrna Beach, particularly at the Black Dolphin Inn, a 14-room Spanish-Isle charmer crafted with old Florida wood and filled with mid-century decor. Top off your morning coffee with a locally sourced breakfast in the sunny dining nook before heading off for a back-country fishing excursion with BlackFly on the Indian River in Mosquito Lagoon.

When cold beers and fish tacos call, head to The Taco Shack, a locally owned and operated surf-themed taqueria where booths and burritos are in high demand.

Driving is permitted on specified areas of the hard-packed sandy beaches of Daytona Beach and New Smyrna Beach — a rarity in Florida. Pay the ten-dollar permit fee (with a maximum speed of 10 mph, windows down, lights on and no texting, please,) and take in the ocean breeze. If you’re toting kids, take them to meet the locals (turtles, stingrays, manatees) at the Marine Science Center. Or hit up Three Brothers Paddleboards for SUP jaunts on the backwater estuaries on beautifully handcrafted woodies inspired by the classic surfboards of the 1950s and ‘60s.

All that sun and sand can build up an appetite. Big bowls of mussels and cioppino are calling from a table under the arbor at The Garlic, a kitschy Italian joint where meatballs are called bocce balls (and are about the same size).

Along with 23 miles of white sand beaches you’ll find a striking, iconic watermark: the historic Ponce de Leon Inlet lighthouse. If your travel schedule and the lunar calendar align for Climb to the Moon, you’ll be treated to sparkling beverages, light bites, and a panorama of the coast under the light of a full moon.

Workout the arms and calm the mind with a morning kayaking adventure on the Tomoka River. While there, soak up the history of local Native American tribes at Tomoka State Park.

Fill up on good coffee, omelettes and apple fritters like the locals do at the upbeat Cracked Egg Diner. The sunny breakfast outpost is run by two brothers who make customers – and tasty foods – a priority.

For a look at Florida interpreted on canvas, swing by the Cici & Hyatt Brown Museum of Art, new to the Smithsonian-affiliated Museum of Arts and Sciences. The Brown Museum houses the largest collection of Florida-themed watercolors and oil paintings (dating back to 1839).

Indulge your inner carb-lover at Donnie’s Donuts, a modern doughnut shop with organic, tricked-out treats that are fried to perfection and served with fair trade coffee.

Kick back at the beach then knock a few back during happy hour at The Joint, a craft beer bar and lounge — and one of the first stops on the Daytona Beach Ale Trail that includes stops at Ormond Brewing Company, Tomoka Brewery, Seabreeze Taphouse, Odd Elixir Meads, and other local favorites. Just make sure you have a designated driver for the night.

Just outside Downtown DeLand in DeLeon Springs State Park you’ll find the oh-so-popular Old Spanish Mill Restaurant, where diners can cook pancakes right at their table. Explore the miles of trails on-site, and see manatees, alligators, and an amazing variety of birds.

For a brisk round of golf, the area provides more than 20 opportunities to hone your skills. LPGA International offers two 18-hole championship courses, and nearby Victoria Hills has rolling hills, sand obstacles, and pine tree-lined fairways that look more like the Carolinas than the Floridian-style courses.

The Golf Club at Cypress Head and Daytona Beach Golf Club are both excellent public golf courses, and definitely a good bang (and challenge) for the buck.

Before catching your flight, make a pitstop at Hull’s Seafood, a wholesale and to-go shop with daily lunch specials, fish platters, soups, salads, and steamed shellfish. Finish off with a hushpuppy and slice of Floridian key lime pie."
304,9,"The reason so many of us declare confidently—standing tall at the ripe old ages of 10,11,12—that we want to be astronauts when we grow up is the magical pull of an idea that reaches deep, an exhilarating challenge to the furthest limits of curiosity. For most people imagination is as far as it goes, and for those who actually pursue the ambition to become an astronaut, the barrier to entry is extremely high. NASA selects only a tiny fraction of applicants. In 2013, more than 6,000 people applied. NASA picked eight. Of those who make it all the way through astronaut training, even fewer have the opportunity to visit the International Space Station—an orbiting laboratory a bit larger than a six-bedroom house that contains one of the world’s best examples of international cooperation in the pursuit of knowledge. It’s up there right now, orbiting the earth once every 90 minutes, 220 miles up. NASA will help you find where it is at any given moment right here. What follows is for those of us who will never get to make the trip: a chance to see what it’s like up close.

When astronaut candidates begin training, one of the first things they have to master, oddly enough, is swimming. In addition to becoming scuba-certified, they have to swim three lengths of a 25-meter pool without stopping. Then they have to do it again in a flight suit and tennis shoes. This prepares them for spacewalks, also known as Extra-Vehicular Activities (EVAs), which refer to any work that’s done outside a spacecraft. Astronaut candidates also undergo extensive training in hypobaric and hyperbaric environments, and with periods of simulated weightlessness. Missions to the ISS can require an additional two or three years of training after the initial astronaut candidate period. At the Sonny Carter Training Facility, also known as the Neutral Buoyancy Laboratory, a 6.2-million gallon water tank is used to simulate weightlessness, and a model of the International Space Station, fully submerged, allows them to practice everything they’ll be doing at the ISS, from such daily activities as preparing food to spacewalks.

Up until March of this year, typical missions to the ISS have lasted between three and six months. But now, American astronaut Scott Kelly and Russian cosmonaut Mikhail Kornienko are almost halfway through the first ever one-year mission to the ISS. More explicitly than any previous mission, the goal of the one-year experience is to see how the two men's bodies and minds react to such an extended period in space. This will help NASA determine how far humans are from being able to handle–physically and psychologically–a trip to Mars, which could take several years. To get a sense of what that would be like, here’s a look at Kelly and Kornienko’s home:

Most people think it’s zero gravity that causes astronauts to float, but on the ISS that’s actually not the case. In fact, the station is subject to 90 percent of the gravity that’s found on the earth. Astronauts float on the ISS and outside on spacewalks because they are in a state of free-fall. They miss the earth because the speed at which they are traveling–17,500 mph–is enough to counteract the force of gravity that would otherwise pull them down, so they just keep falling, as if they’re always on the downhill side of a roller coaster. Even though they understand all this, they say, the feeling of weightlessness never gets old.

A little push with your big toe will take you halfway across the station. It’s like being Superman—with just the brush of a finger. It does not get old, even after 381 days.”

You sweat buckets up there. On the ground, when you’re riding the bike, the sweat drips off you. Up there, the sweat sticks to you—you have pools of sweat on your arms, your head, around your eyes. Once in a while, a glob of it will go flying off.”

In many elements of the ISS astronaut experience, there are attempts to approximate the creature comforts of life on earth. But, obviously, it’s never quite the same, and sleep might be the quintessential example of that. When it’s time to turn in for the night, astronauts don comfy pajamas, open the doors to their sleep pods, and zip themselves into a sleeping-bag-like enclosure. In space, though, they never actually lie down, knowing that when the lights go out and the doors close, they’ll just float in their sleeping bags, unaware of which way is up.

A lot of people think astronauts’ food is nothing like what we eat on earth–that it’s all unrecognizable and, well, gross. But while almost everything they eat is either freeze-dried, thermostabilized (i.e. canned but not stored in metal), or powdered, requiring rehydration—and while some foods are off the table entirely because they don’t conform to NASA’s requirements—meals aren’t as limited or unappetizing as we think, and the menu isn’t completely out of astronauts’ hands. There are more than 200 items on the “core menu” that NASA offers, about 110 of which have been developed from scratch by the food lab scientists. Before traveling to the ISS, astronauts meet with NASA’s food lab to try out their options and make some selections for what they want to eat (each gets to pick nine for every six-month stint on the ISS). One of the astronauts’ favorites is freeze-dried shrimp cocktail with a spicy cocktail sauce, both of which have to be rehydrated. Every once in a while, though, the astronauts get a shipment of fresh fruits, and even non-freeze-dried ice cream. And when that happens, it’s a party!

You miss literally everything. You miss water that flows from the faucet and doesn’t fly around you. You want to be surrounded by nature. You miss Earth, even though it’s always in front of you. All the normal everyday things that we often don’t value here. Up there, they become most important.”

It's kind of like going over Niagara Falls in a barrel, but the barrel is on fire.”

I’ve been telling people it’s like getting on the Tilt-a-Whirl, you know, that amusement ride — sitting on that for a couple of months and then getting off.”

And they are never the same, perhaps most of all because they have a new perspective on home, having seen Planet Earth from afar. As ISS astronaut Nicole Stott puts it: “I don't know how you can come back and not, in some way, be changed. It may be subtle. You see a difference in different people in their general response when they come back from space. But I think, collectively, everybody has that emblazoned on their memories, the way the planet looks. You can't take that lightly."""
305,9,"Memorial Day Reminds Us of the Very Best in Men

It is fitting that Memorial Day falls in the middle of our current undertaking to compile stories about “the good in men.” However, many times, the solemn awe of the sacrifice by so many is difficult to put into words. The debt owed by a nation to those who have given their very best—everything, to be precise—weighs more than a value statement to be measured by human understanding.

Though, how we carry on their legacy perhaps provides the greatest meaning. From Concord and Lexington to the modern day Middle East, the men and women who have died in battle have provided us with examples of honor, valor, courage, and all the traits to which we should ascribe. The character values of the fallen are intrinsically tied to the patriotic spirit we uphold when we recognize what they have given on Memorial Day.

This weekend, as we remember our greatest heroes, one segment of the Égard Watch Company video response to Gillette carries particular meaning. A Department of Defense statistic citing how men comprise 97% of war fatalities appears as Egard’s CEO Ilan Srulovicz asks, “Is a man a hero?”

While the rows of white headstones in Arlington and national cemeteries across the country are the resounding answer to these rhetorical questions, aspects of our culture are sadly disconnected from the realities of what type of persons are memorialized in those places.

Under each headstone lies a warrior, embodying the traits of strength, bravery, and, when needed, aggression. Yet, as those decidedly masculine traits are vital in combat, the fallen soldier has exemplified so much more. Love of country, love of others, and self-sacrifice become the transcendent characteristics to a grateful nation.

By their nature, men are driven to be providers and protectors for their families, and we hope you will read the growing collection of accounts of these men we have posted here. Furthermore, we recognize that this very nature is what leads these same men to become the heroes we remember on Memorial Day. They are not here for us to thank them directly, so it is only right that we honor what they have given by remembering that they have showed us the very best in men.

308,9,"Valerie Freeman is accustomed to being the one who cares for and encourages others, but after being diagnosed with triple-negative breast cancer in December 2010, she found herself on the receiving end of both life-saving care and tough-love encouragement from a kindred soul.

""I've come to love Dr. Waintraub because he cares about me as though I were someone in his own family. He never sugar-coats anything. He always keeps it real, but his compassion is awesome. At our first meeting, he said, 'You're going to live through this. You have an aggressive cancer, and we're going to be aggressive in treating it, but you're going to get through this,"" Freeman, 49, says of Stanley Waintraub, MD, FACP, co-chief of breast oncology at the John Theurer Cancer Center at Hackensack University Medical Center and a member of Regional Cancer Care Associates (RCCA).

As a mentor to young women in her hometown of Paterson, Freeman regularly listens to others recount their problems or challenges before offering advice and support that, while sympathetic, is also straightforward. In facing the biggest challenge of her life, she valued her physician taking the same approach. ""At every visit I had with Dr. Waintraub, he always made me feel that I could handle it, that I could get through it,"" she said of her six-month chemotherapy regimen. ""He could be stern, but he was always compassionate. No question was a dumb question. He explained everything - he even drew on a white board to outline things.""

Freeman's battle with cancer began in the summer of 2010, when she noticed a lump in her right breast. At the time, she was busy caring for her mother, who was terminally ill with lung cancer, so she deferred seeking care. At her mother's urging, she eventually had the lump evaluated, and the initial findings were negative. Following her mother's death in October 2010, however, Freeman had follow-up tests that resulted in her receiving a diagnosis of breast cancer on Dec. 29, 2010.

After undergoing lumpectomy at another area hospital, Freeman turned to the John Theurer Cancer Center (JTCC) because she had been very impressed with the way that the RCCA doctors, the nurses, and others there had cared for her mother. Further, she adds that in battling tripe-negative breast cancer, she wanted access to the medical expertise, comprehensive services, and wide-ranging clinical trials offered by JTCC and RCCA, one of the largest oncology physician networks in the United States.

The form of breast cancer that Freeman had is called ""triple negative"" because the cancerous cells do not express genes for estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR) or Her2/neu, targets of the chemotherapies commonly used to treat breast cancer. This lack of receptors that respond to standard chemotherapy regimens makes the cancer particularly difficult to treat, and often requires the use of combinations of chemotherapies. Triple-negative breast cancer, or TNBC, affects African-American women and Hispanic women at a much higher rate than white and Asian women, and during her treatment at JTCC, Freeman entered a clinical trial evaluating new therapeutic approaches to TNBC in African-American women.

While Freeman said that her chemotherapy course was marked by side effects and often grueling, she credits Dr. Waintraub and the nurses, social workers, nutritionists, and others at JTCC with providing care that was as compassionate as it was comprehensive. ""They're amazing,"" she says of the nurses and other team members. ""They didn't make me feel like a patient. They knew me - Val. They knew my likes and dislikes. When I go for follow-up visits, I still get a sick feeling in my stomach when I'm outside the center, because it brings back memories of everything I had to go through, but that goes away the minute I'm inside and seeing all the people who know me and took care of me.""

Today, a little over five years after receiving her diagnosis of TNBC, Freeman remains in remission, and recently moved from a three-month follow-up schedule to a six-month schedule. She is making the most of her good health by enjoying her family and giving back to the community. In addition to mentoring young women, she serves as secretary of Paterson Cares, an organization that feeds the homeless, and is involved in other efforts to enhance the quality of life in Paterson.

She also shares her experience with other women. ""You have to tell your story because you never know who that story will touch,"" she adds. ""I tell people not to view a diagnosis of cancer as a death sentence. That's what you think automatically when you get the news, but it's not necessarily the case any longer. With today's medicine and technology and the different approaches they can use, there is a lot of reason for hope. And while going through treatment can be tough, it's not as bad as you think.""

Dr. Waintraub, who treated Freeman, is a board-certified medical oncologist and hematologist specializing in breast cancer care and research. He received a medical degree from New York Medical College and completed his residency at Metropolitan Hospital Center in New York City before going on to fellowships at Montefiore Medical Center and Memorial Sloan-Kettering Medical Center. He has treated patients in northern New Jersey for more than 30 years.

Dr. Waintraub is one of more than 100 cancer care specialists in RCCA, an oncology physician network dedicated to transforming oncology care by ensuring that cancer patients have access to the highest-quality, most-comprehensive, cutting-edge treatments in a compassionate and community-based setting. RCCA's cancer care specialists are supported by 700 employees at 30 care delivery sites, providing care to more than 23,000 new patients annually and more than 240,000 existing patients.

For some participants in a July 16 cleanup of the Clinton River in Oakland County, the main goal was to help boost fish populations. Others wanted a cleaner river to enjoy for activities such as canoeing or kayaking. Whatever their motivations, the cleanup left all groups satisfied and, organizers said, served as another example of outdoor lovers of all kinds coming together to preserve the state’s natural resources.

“Essentially, it’s for the preservation and the overall benefit of the river,” said Adam Trenz, who organized the Metro-West Steelheaders participation in the effort. “Without someone stepping up and doing it, what would the river look like?”

Joining members of the Steelheaders in the cleanup were volunteers from the Clinton River Watershed Council and the Michigan United Conservation Clubs On the Ground program.

During the three hours the 15 volunteers spent cleaning a 2-mile stretch of the Clinton River at Yates Park in Rochester Hills, they removed more than 200 pounds of trash, including items such as a tire, a large metal grate, a bucket of paint, many bottles and cans, plastic and the occasional shoe.

At the previous two of what has become an annual cleanup, the groups picked a total of 700 pounds of trash from the water.

“Beyond the science-based management of our forests, waters and wildlife performed by state and federal agencies, these types of volunteer-led efforts are essential to preserving Michigan’s outdoor heritage for future generations,” said Henry Stancato of the Michigan Wildlife Council.

Indeed, Sarah Topp, the Michigan United Conservation Club’s wildlife volunteer coordinator, said the On the Ground program – which she oversees – was created to undertake projects that Michigan Department of Natural Resources staffers otherwise lacked the time or resources to handle.

Launched in 2013, the program draws from a roster of 350 volunteers who complete a couple dozen conservation projects throughout the state every year. The On the Ground program is funded in the form of a DNR Wildlife Habitat Grant through a portion of hunting and fishing licenses sold each year.

For instance, among other endeavors, On the Ground volunteers so far this year have also planted trees to create elk habitat in the Pigeon River Country State Forest and cut black locust trees in the Rose Lake State Wildlife Area northeast of Lansing to make homes – known as “rabbitat” – for small game animals.

On the Ground focuses on projects that improve habitat for game species and sport fish on lands open to the public for hunting and fishing. For example, the underlying reason for the Clinton River cleanup was to remove barriers to fish spawning sites, Topp noted.

On the Ground projects also serve to show the general public that those who hunt and fish are “true conservationists,” the program’s website states.

That’s a message that resonates with many volunteers with varied outdoor interests, Topp said.

“We get a lot of volunteers who don’t hunt or fish but they like to bird-watch, for example,” she said. “Everyone understands that what we do creates opportunity for seeing wildlife.”

The Metro-West Steelheaders have a similar philosophy regarding their community involvement, Trenz said.

“It’s all about leaving it for the future,” he said. “It’s not always about harvesting. I probably release 90 percent of the fish I catch each year. It’s about having access to resources.”

While most individual conservation projects performed by volunteers are relatively small in scale, cumulatively they serve as an important complement to the DNR and other agency professional management of Michigan’s outdoor resources, Topp said.

“Sometimes, Mother Nature needs an assist,” she said. “I wish more people took time to understand the benefits of various types of management techniques.”

Topp said volunteers are welcome to join other On the Ground projects slated for this summer, including:
• Aug. 7, Grayling State Forest

 Pruning apple trees in a historic orchard that has been thriving on state lands, providing soft mast to the area’s whitetail deer, black bear, elk, small game and birds.
• Aug. 13, Barry State Game Area

 Cutting down black locust trees and utilizing them to build large brush piles for “rabbitat.”
• Aug. 27, Shingleton State Forest

 Planting trees and shrubs in the Garden Grade Grouse Enhanced Management Site. The habitat work will benefit grouse, woodcock, deer, snowshoe hare and many other species.

311,9," -- President Obama said today that he does not believe GOP frontrunner Donald Trump will make it to the White House, but the real estate mogul took the remark as a compliment, saying Obama has done a ""lousy job.""

""I continue to believe Mr. Trump will not be president,"" Obama said while speaking at a press conference in Rancho Mirage, California. ""And the reason is because I have a lot of faith in the American people.""

Obama told reporters he believed Americans still see the presidency as ""a serious job.""

“It’s not hosting a talk show, or a reality show. It’s not promotion, it’s not marketing,” Obama said. “It’s hard and a lot of people count on us getting it right.”

Obama did not, however, answer whether he believed Trump was capable of securing the GOP nomination.

The president also took a shot at the rest of the GOP field, saying “foreign observers are troubled” by the GOP's rhetoric, specifically the doubting of climate change and proposals to ban Muslims from entering the U.S.

Trump, speaking at a campaign event in South Carolina, immediately hit back, saying Obama is doing a ""lousy job.""

 ""While we lose muscle mass and our endurance slows as we age, what has always been assumed was part of the normal aging process is made much worse by having a sedentary lifestyle than by merely aging,"" said John Hanrahan, Fitness Center coordinator at Westminster Place, a Presbyterian Homes retirement community in suburban Chicago. ""The saying 'use it or lose it' is absolutely true. We can add muscle to improve strength, increase cardiovascular endurance and improve balance at any age.""

 

 A study published in June by the Oregon State University College of Public Health and Human Sciences showed that 300 minutes a week of light exercise provides significant health benefits for people over age 65. Older adults who engaged in light exercise were 18% healthier overall than their less-active peers. Moreover, light exercise is less likely to cause injuries than moderate to vigorous exercise.

 

 According to OSU professor and study co-author Brad Cardinal, active older adults have lower body mass index, smaller waist circumferences and more balanced insulin levels and are less likely to be afflicted by chronic diseases.

 

 Westminster Place offers many options and opportunities for residents to improve and maintain their fitness. 

 

 ""We have a beautiful fitness center with a well-appointed gym and two pools,"" Hanrahan said. ""We offer group exercise classes for just about everyone. There are land and water classes, seated and standing classes at different times of the day spread throughout our campus.""

 

 Water aerobics, yoga and balance classes are among the more popular offerings, said Hanrahan, who thinks that adults should engage in water aerobics for the energy and group camaraderie, yoga for the physical, mental and perhaps spiritual aspects, and balance classes because balance is something that we all need to work on: ""Even some of us less than 'senior age,' since our balance begins to decline in our 30s."" 

 

 Exercise is part of the new initiative ""Choices: A Program for Living Well"" introduced at Presbyterian Homes and designed to focus on aspects of wellness identified by the International Council on Active Aging. 

 

 The program teaches the multidimensional aspects of healthy living, offering many choices for active older adults based on their interests. The content was based largely on feedback from residents at the five Presbyterian Homes communities in the Greater Chicago area. 

 

 Beyond physical health, the program includes six other wellness dimensions — social, emotional, spiritual, intellectual, community and environmental. The new program is part of a larger campaign by Presbyterian Homes to ensure that residents achieve the highest level of well-being in mind, body and spirit. 

 

 Residents at Westminster Place can also sign up for a national senior fitness test to track personal goals over time. And Hanrahan has designed a fitness boot camp that starts in October for adults seeking a more intense class or heavier workout to achieve their goals. 

 

 ""We'll focus on building strength and endurance by mixing cardio and strength exercises in functional and fun ways,"" Hanrahan said. ""It'll be a new program for us, but I think people will really enjoy it."""
313,9,"First of a three-part series exploring the use of swaps, asset-based lending and foreign currency exchange to balance business risks and find opportunities.

With interest rates suddenly inching up, businesses big and small are considering converting adjustable rate loans to fixed rates. Traditional refinancing methods are always available, but there is another option.

Sophisticated fiduciaries at Fortune 500 companies have for years utilized derivatives known as interest rate swaps in order to better manage monetary risk.

Interest rate swaps are, in their simplest form, an exchange of payments. One party in the swap trades the flexible rate on its debt to a fixed set of interest payments for a number of years – say five percent over 10 years. The other party receives adjustable rate payments, which are indexed to interest rates, usually the one or three month LIBOR rate.

But in practice, interest rate swaps can be complicated and smaller to mid-sized companies might believe the derivatives game is beyond their scope of financial wherewithal or perhaps too risky to manage effectively.

Not so. Today, more banks – and not just the money center banks – offer interest rate swaps to their customers and will take care of all the paperwork, regulation compliance, accounting, and monitoring to make the process as streamlined as possible.

“These are tools being used by the major corporations to reduce risk,” said Michael Bontrager, founder and CEO of Chatham Financial, a global financial advisory services and technology firm based in Kennett Square, Pennsylvania. “Now, banks like Rockland Trust are saying that if you’re a smaller company you can have the same financial options – and protections – as the major corporations.”

In a way, Bontrager notes, banks that are offering rate swaps are “democratizing the ability of more companies to avail themselves of these products.”

So what exactly are rate swaps? Why would someone want to use the product? And how do they work?

It starts with the natural inclination of borrowers to generally want fixed-rate loans to better manage their costs and expectations. Banks, however, fund their loans with deposits that have fluctuating interest rates so managing net interest margins can be problematic, especially when short term rates are expected to increase. Therefore, the adjustable rate loans are lower risk and can be more preferable.

This common tension creates markets and opportunities for both banks and borrowers.

It’s a win for borrowers because they can convert some or all of their floating rate debt to fixed rates – good to do in the current rising rate environment – without going through the time and expense of a total refinancing. It’s a win for the bank because it finds a third party wishing to receive the fixed rate, while the bank retains the original adjustable rate. Because swapped loans are lower risk to the banks, the banks can then be more competitive on pricing, passing some of the benefit back to the borrower.

In other words, the borrower is able to hedge their risk by locking in a more competitive long term fixed rate, while the bank takes on an adjustable rate loan that enables them to more adequately manage their margins. Interest rate swaps are traded over the counter, and if a company decides to exchange interest rates, it will need to agree, in theory, with another party on such things as length and terms of the swap. But mostly the bank handles those arrangements and the original borrower is not involved directly in those issues.

Getting Under The Hood

The mechanics of how it’s all done involves several parties – the bank’s customer, the bank, and a counter-party or swap dealer that the bank’s borrower never sees. A large money center bank – such as Deutsche Bank, J.P. Morgan, Wells Fargo or Bank of America – serves as a swap dealer. These are companies that make markets in swap trading and take positions in the swap markets for their own accounts.

Riding herd on all of this are companies like Chatham Financial, which is an independent advisor for both the bank and the customer.

“The advisor is there to make sure pricing is appropriate and the terms are structured properly,” said Rockland Trust’s Nelson. “Some customers may be new to swaps or may feel they don’t have the expertise, so firms like Chatham will guide them through the process.”

Chatham’s Bontrager notes that one of the advantages of a swap is it separates the debt decisions of corporate treasurers from the interest rate decisions.

“Normally, those decisions are made simultaneously,” he said. “Swaps put a lot more control and flexibility in the hands of the treasurer.”

There are other advantages, as well. Fixed rate loans typically carry pre-payment penalties while swaps may carry penalties in a falling rate environment, but they can create a realized gain if rates go up and the borrower elects to terminate the swap.

Greg Vickowski, the chief financial officer of The Procaccianti Group, a privately held real estate investment and management company based in Cranston, R.I, has been utilizing swaps for nearly 30 years. His company buys hotels that are usually underperforming and renovates and rebrands them. Initially, he said, banks are less willing to commit to fixed-rate loans until the property stabilizes.

“At that time we might swap all or some of the debt for a fixed-rate,” Vickowski said. “It’s highly advantageous and certainly less expensive and more efficient than refinancing an entire loan.”

Vickowski notes, however, that nearly three-fourths of Procaccianti’s debt is in so-called CMBS instruments (commercial mortgage-backed securities) that have little flexibility and are not offered by most traditional banks because they tend to be more complex and volatile than residential mortgage-backed securities.

“There’s a large population that doesn’t want to deal with CMBS shops because it can be slow, impersonal, cumbersome, inflexible and expensive,” he said. “That’s why banks like Rockland can prosper in this market.

Deciding If Swaps Are The Right Choice

Financial experts say some of the factors in the decision matrix about swaps would include:
• How sensitive is my business to interest rate changes?
• What percentage of my debt is fixed versus fluctuating?
• How much certainty do I have in my borrowing?
• Are there things coming in the next year that could drive up my debt?

“Adjustable rates have done really well over the last 10 years,” said Nelson. “But, given the current direction of short term rates, borrowers may now want to manage some risk by floating only a portion of it and moving some to a fixed rate.”

There are, of course, inherent risks in rate swaps. Chief among them is the fact that interest rates are unpredictable. Swaps carry a market value that fluctuates with market rates. As rates change the borrower may float into an unrealized gain or loss position. If the borrower looks to exit their swap, their position will be monetized. Another risk involves the additional level of complication in managing one’s debt portfolio.

Most of the risks can largely be mitigated by dealing with reputable institutions in strong financial positions and relying on well-established companies to represent the customers and the banks. Rockland Trust has successfully executed more than $1 billion in swap loans since 2009.

With rates on the rise, many experts believe there will be an increased interest in rate swaps.

That is, in a word, overkill. It’s uncalled for.

But we’re not gonna take it anymore. And you shouldn’t, either!

This year, it’s time to take a stand.

Time to kick dieting to the curb, once and for all.

To band together and declare in one unified voice that we will not be influenced to dabble in the unsustainable, sometimes ridiculous fad diets that pop up incessantly everywhere we turn. That we will not be guilted into passing on a piece of birthday cake. That the occasional late-night dessert run is not so bad, and that carbs are most certainly not the enemy.

In 2016, let’s take the time to focus on the more important things in life — the accomplishments that can’t be measured by a scale or waistline. Let’s focus on and recognize your familial and professional accomplishments, and all the other things you do that make the world a better place for you and those around you.

And dietarily speaking, let’s adopt sustainable, achievable nutrition and wellness practices that help us achieve our health goals.

Instead of dieting, let’s band together in pursuit of the innumerable benefits that come with living a healthy lifestyle, and leave dieting guilt and shame by the wayside.

We rounded up personal tips and tricks to staying productive and focused from some of the most exciting tech entrepreneurs. While some might recommend particular software or organizational methods to stay on track, others approach productivity in a more global way. But one thing that many of these entrepreneurs have in common is that each of their dreams, to some degree, came to fruition due to their own personal style of productivity.

Take a page from their books, and with a little luck, you'll be helping to build empires in short order.

Elon Musk, founder of SpaceX and Tesla Motors, can't quite manage to add more hours to the day — yet. Instead, he treats multitasking like a rocket science, conducting business on his phone during precious family time and emailing so often that he jokingly considers it his ""core competency."" No surprise, then, that Musk and those who help manage his tightly packed schedule treat his inbox as though it's buried deep inside Fort Knox, according to a Quora post on the subject. Only a lucky few know his current email address.

At 14 years old, Shubham Banerjee is one of the world's youngest entrepreneurs. He is the inventor of Braigo (Braille + Lego), a cost-effective braille printer.

Microsoft took notice. Banerjee worked with the company to build the next iteration of his original braille printer on a Windows operating system. This was a big step up from the Lego set he used to build his own starting version in 2013.

His accomplishment is helping those who can't see have access to a smarter and better Braille printer. For Banerjee, creating something with technology that has a bigger purpose helps him stay focused, according to U.S. News and World Report.

Ingrid Vanderveldt is the CEO and founder of the Empowering a Billion Women by 2020 movement. The group, formally launched in 2015, is focused around three key pillars: mobility, mentoring and money. The goal of the organization is to give women the tools and community they need to become successful entrepreneurs, no matter where they live.

Vanderveldt told the Next Women her ability to stay focused by leaning on her support network and remembering the end goal of her project helps her accomplish challenging tasks.

Dan Hubert is the CEO and co-founder of AppyParking, which leverages big data to tell people (and eventually automated cars) where they can legally park their ride. Hubert was in advertising until he tried to attend a show at Royal Albert Hall in London in 2012 and had a hassle figuring out the parking rules around the venue. So, he set about digitizing maps and compiling PDFs that contain parking rules for areas of London, and AppyParking was born. Earlier this year, the company announced a partnership with Ford to help bring ""painless parking"" to the masses.

While a lot of people spend time searching for and switching between various systems and apps to keep track of all their work, Hubert told Mic that he uses just one flexible system, makes it work for him and gets on with the work.

Nick D'Aloisio is a bit of a teenage wonder. He developed Summly, later bought by Yahoo, when he was 17 years old, but it wasn't a first-inning home run. He got started long before that, developing one app after another, carefully learning from them each time.

One of D'Aloisio's keys is never wanting to, or settling for, just coasting by, he told the Financial Times. Instead, he continues to push himself by creating personal challenges to build new apps for new purposes.

Jack Dorsey is most widely known as the co-founder (and recently named CEO) of Twitter. He's also the CEO of Square, a payment-processing company. In short, he pulls Elon Musk-level double duty.

The way he keeps it all straight is by theming his days, according to Forbes: Monday is for management and running the companies (both companies); Tuesday is all about the product; Wednesday is for marketing and growth; Thursday is for partnerships; Friday is company culture and recruiting; Saturday is time off, and Sunday is for reflection and strategy.

For the rest of us, that might mean Monday is for meetings, Tuesday is for new business, etc. — but you get the drift. The more you can prioritize and organize your schedule by day during the week, the more productive you can be.

Clara Shih is the founder and CEO of Hearsay Social. The company, which started as an idea for an app from Shih, gives teams around the world the power to connect with customers and grow their businesses on social media channels. She urges young entrepreneurs ""to take more risks and to embrace every mistake they make,"" according to Fortune. When starting her own company with a former Stanford classmate, Shih knew some risks were involved, but she took those challenges head on and is now a founder of a successful tech company.

While starting something new or tackling a larger challenge can present us with risk and potential failure, it is only through these mistakes that we learn and grow. Failure often just creates information for how to learn to do better in the future. Shih uses this belief in learning and collecting data from missteps to be more productive in her everyday life and career, she told Fortune.

Whether it's particular productivity hacks or larger vision-oriented approaches to getting things done, take a few words of wisdom from those who've been there before to sort through the clutter and make your own impact."

320,9,"If you thought it would cost thousands of dollars to turn your house into a smart home, think again.

Gone are the days when an online connection was confined to just your computer – now you can have everything from your refrigerator to your record player use the internet.

And the chances are, you already have a lot of the necessary technology in your home.

With a few simple tweaks, it’s now possible to hook households up to get the newest tech – with the strongest WiFi signal – around the home. We investigate how…

If things really are bad, then it might be worth considering buying a booster.

However, before you do, it's worth doing a bit of hunting online, as in many cases its possible to use an old router as a booster, simply by ticking a couple of boxes on its settings.

If you have a second router that's only about a year old, it can probably be set to operate in 'access point' or repeater mode. Configuring is often as simple as clicking a button

It's also worth checking your other WiFi kit - for instance, some Sonos WiFi enabled speakers such as the Playbar, below, can also double as a signal booster.

If you're a T-Mobile customer, there's also another option - the Personal CellSpot.

This piece of kit can be used to maximize your personal coverage, even beyond the reach of any cellular network, which means where you have blackspots in your home - for example in the basement - you could now enjoy great coverage.

The Personal CellSpot can optimise WiFi calling and give you faster data, and simply plugs in.

Turn your old phone into a security camera

If you've got an old iPad or iPhone lying around, it's relatively simple to turn it into a security camera without having to spent hundreds of dollars on new kit.

Free apps such as Presence can send a live stream to you wherever you are.

It provides a live stream from the area you want to monitor.

You can set it up to record video clips when it detects motion, too.

If you buy a robotic viewing stand for about $100, you can even move the camera 360 degrees rather than stick with a stationary view.

As with everything in technology, things change quickly - and WiFi standards are no exception.

The good news is that you may even be able to do this for free.

Check with the firm that makes your router to see if they have a firmware update available.

This will update your router's software, and can often have a big effect on its speed and range.

It's also worth considering a new handset.

For instance, the new iPhone 6 handsets offer a new standard called 802.11ac, which offers far faster connection speeds that the iPhone 5s, which only had 801.11n.

However, be warned, there are a plethora of terrible acronyms to deal with when it comes to WiFi standards.

In general, wireless A, B, and G are old and slow, and wireless n or ac will give you the fastest speeds around.

Note that you'll need both a compatible router and card in your computer or phone if you want the full speed boost.

One of the best ways to improve your home WiFi is to change the channel it uses.

WiFi uses a spectrum of frequency space, and each has different channels that can be used.

Most routers are using the 2.4GHz band and there is a total of 14 channels for this band, though only 13 (or less) are mostly used throughout the world.

However, the problem is that many routers are configured to use the same channel.

In a place such as a large apartment block where there are many routers, this can cause major congestion.

Other WiFi networks will interfere with your WiFi signal, causing it to go slow.

However, changing channels is relatively simple, and free apps can show you exactly which channels are in use, helping you choose the best one.

One neat trick is to use your phone to do this - apps such as Wifi Analyzer on Android will do this for free.

Switch it off and on again

It's the cry of IT departments everywhere - have you tried switching it off and on again?

Yet most of the time, it works.

With WiFi routers, resetting the device every now and again isn't a bad idea, and some experts even recommend it.

By resetting the router, you are forcing the router to reconnect to your service provider - which can often result in a boost to speed.

Admittedly most routers aren't the prettiest pieces of kit - but that doesn't mean you should hide them behind the TV cabinet.

Experts say the key if you want the best signal is to have the router out in the open, free of any walls and obstructions.

Point the antennas vertically, and elevate the router if you can.

Jason Cole, a PhD physics student at the John Adams Institute at Imperial College London, turned to mathematics to find out how he could improve his internet connection.

Using something known as the Helmholtz equation, which can resolve physical problems in both space and time, Mr Cole simulated his flat in a program called Matlab.

In the simulation he mapped out his flat and then created a virtual router and computer, shown below.

He suggests that the only solution to ensure as few blackspots as possible is to place the router in the middle of the flat.

'It turned out that the model I developed was very sensitive to every little detail, so it was difficult to say other than the common sense advice: direct line-of-sight to the router is best,' he explains.

'There is also some reflection of the signal around corners, but engineers tell me reflections are bad too.

'In my case, the best position was as central as possible, preferably near open doorways.'

Lastly, make sure its in the center of your house, so you have the best coverage possible throughout your home

Get online for free when you're out and about - or in the air

Getting free WiFi wherever you are is getting easier by the day.

Chances are, your mobile network and internet provider already have deals to give you access to other networks when you're out and about.

Many cities, such as San Francisco and New York, are also rolling out free WiFi services in parks and shopping centres.

For customers of T-mobile, even flying doesn't stop the free WiFi.

The firm offers free in-flight texting, picture messaging, and access to T-Mobile Visual Voicemail on Gogo equipped US airlines.

Use your phone as a remote

If you've got a relatively new TV or cable box, the chances are that, as the saying goes: there's an app for that.

Many of these make navigating the impenetrable menus of your programme guide far easier - particularly some of the tablet versions of cable TV firm's apps.

Some will even act as a second screen, letting you watch TV in bed or even out and about.

TV boxes such as Apple TV also have accompanying apps that make entering text and navigating easy.

Consoles such as Microsoft's Xbox and Sony's Playstation also have great apps letting you do everything from buy games to access secret maps.

The good news is, most of the apps are free - so it's well worth investigating if your home electronics are already WiFi enabled.

While the idea of a smart home where every gadget can talk to each other sounds futuristic (not to mention expensive), you can actually make your home smart right now - and increase your productivity.

The key is a simple service called IFTTT, which stands for If This Then That.

A basic programming language for everything from Dropbox to smart lightbulbs, it lets you create rules such as 'when I get an email for X then flash my living room light on'.

Its very simple to use, and really good fun to play with, to give your home a bit of an intelligence boost.

A surprising number of people don't take advantage of the electronic kit they already own.

For instance, the latest smart TVs and hifis often offer music streaming services such as Spotify for users.

Some, such as Sonos, pictured below, offer a vast range of services, letting you listen to everything from Google Music to Deezer at the press of a button - as well as giving you access to radio stations from around the world.

""I continue to believe Mr. Trump will not be president,"" Obama said while speaking at a press conference in Rancho Mirage, California. ""And the reason is because I have a lot of faith in the American people.""

Obama told reporters he believed Americans still see the presidency as ""a serious job.""

“It’s not hosting a talk show, or a reality show. It’s not promotion, it’s not marketing,” Obama said. “It’s hard and a lot of people count on us getting it right.”

Obama did not, however, answer whether he believed Trump was capable of securing the GOP nomination.

The president also took a shot at the rest of the GOP field, saying “foreign observers are troubled” by the GOP's rhetoric, specifically the doubting of climate change and proposals to ban Muslims from entering the U.S.

Trump, speaking at a campaign event in South Carolina, immediately hit back, saying Obama is doing a ""lousy job.""

""He has set us back so far, and for him to actually say that is a great compliment, if you want to know the truth,"" Trump said."

323,9,"For the vast majority of Americans, the career ""finish line"" is hitting a retirement number and being able to retire on their own terms. In reality, though, hitting the finish line is getting increasingly tough. Instead of the road to retirement being a straight line from Point A to B, it's often filled with twists and turns.

Unexpected expenses and other rising costs are making the trek to retirement quite the challenge, according to NerdWallet's 2015 New Grad Retirement Report. Based on three key findings, the graduating class of 2015 faces the very real possibility that they may not retire until the age of 75. By comparison, the average retirement age today is 62.

How retiring at 75 could become a reality

 What's pushing Millenials to work until the ripe age of 75?

The first big issue is the growing amount of student debt today's graduates are dealing with. Average student debt these days is $35,051, up from $29,400 just three years prior, while starting wages are up only around $1,200 since 2012. With college becoming more of a requirement than an exception to land a job where economic advancement is possible, college tuitions have been rising at a pace that's vastly outpacing wage growth and inflation. The result is more than $1.2 trillion in cumulative student loan debt.

According to NerdWallet, the average student loan repayment plan was 10 years, amounting to $4,239 being repaid annually (including interest payments). All told, NerdWallet suggests that repaying student loans could reduce 2015 grads' nest eggs by nearly a third, reducing their lifetime investment-earning potential by more than $684,000 over a 50-year period. Since 2012 the amount in lost retirement savings has jumped by almost $124,000. In other words, instead of investing their savings and compounding their gains over time, grads will instead be diverting their money early in their working years (where it can be of the biggest benefit over the long run) to paying back student debt.

The second big issue is that rents are rising across the nation at a much quicker pace than wages. NerdWallet notes that rent prices across the U.S. are up 11% since 2012. Rising rent prices mean recent grads need to apportion an ever-greater amount of their salaries to covering basic expenses. This leaves less money for investing, and it means a potentially longer wait to retire.

Lastly, NerdWallet pinpoints a lack of trust in Wall Street and skittishness toward investing as a reason why this year's grads may have to wait until age 75 to retire. The effects of the Great Recession still ring true with today's Millennials, meaning many are holding far more in cash than they should be. The result is that average annual investment returns are expected to be down, and it could take extra years for investors with a more conservative approach to reach their retirement number.

NerdWallet estimates suggest that today's grads may still be able to retire at 62, but they'd need to save 20% of their income annually and invest it as opposed to the roughly 6% that they're saving and investing today.

Change what we can control

 Let's face it, we can't change what we can't control. College costs aren't likely to drop anytime soon with the importance of a college education growing, and rent prices may strengthen further as interest rates rise and potential homebuyers back away from paying higher mortgage rates. Some costs are simply beyond the control of today's grads. However, there are steps to be taken that could save grads money and help them do more with what they save.

NerdWallet has a couple of great suggestions, including living at home for as long as is reasonable in order to save on rent costs, as well as maximizing a 401(k) match through your employer. You certainly don't want to leave free money on the table, and should almost always consider contributing at least up to the donation match in your employer-sponsored retirement plan.

But there are plenty of other suggestions that could prove valuable.

For instance, how you save can make a big difference come retirement. Investing in a traditional brokerage account can expose you to taxes each and every time you sell a stock, option, or mutual fund. Although long-term capital gains taxes can be 0% for low-income individuals, you're more likely to wind up paying 15% or 20% in long-term capital gains taxes when selling long-term assets in your brokerage account.

You can completely eliminate taxes by opening up and contributing to a Roth IRA. A Roth IRA allows your money to grow tax-free over your lifetime, there are no required minimum distributions beginning in the year you turn 70 1/2 like its counterpart the Traditional IRA, and there's no point at which you are no longer allowed to contribute to a Roth IRA -- unlike a Traditional IRA, where you're no longer allowed to contribute past age 70. Not having to pay any taxes could save the theoretical investors in NerdWallet's report between $200,000 and $400,000 over a lifetime.

Another important question is what to invest in. On top of keeping your money from winding up in the government's hands, new investors have to be able to trust the stock market once more. Stocks have returned an average of 8% historically, and there will certainly be periods, such as the Great Recession, where things get a bit bumpy and uncomfortable. However, the data doesn't lie. While past performance is no guarantee of future results, all 33 stock market corrections of 10% or more in the S&P 500 between 1950 and 2014 were eventually erased by bull markets. Patience has historically paid off for long-term investors who pick out high-quality companies and hold them over the long run.

It's also not a bad idea for younger investors to consider a more aggressive investment approach that focuses on growth stocks because they have such a long period of time to correct any investment mistakes. Allowing winners to run for decades at a time is a powerful tool that can eliminate quite a few bad stock selections.

Budgeting is another important tool that today's grads are going to want to get themselves accustomed to. Far too few people have a good grasp on their cash flow, and if you don't understand how your expenses weigh on your income, then you'll have a very difficult time saving for your future. Developing a monthly budget should help boost your saving efficiency, and it'll still give you the ability to play around with the numbers to ensure you continue to live a fun life, even while budgeting for your future.

Lastly, consider monetizing your hobbies. Today's Millennials really value their free time -- and their free time could actually be worth a boatload of money. Teaching guitar lessons, couponing to save at the grocery store, buying items at a garage sale then reselling them online, and pet sitting are all examples of personal hobbies that could turn into lucrative side businesses for today's grads. Plus, doing what you love certainly doesn't seem like work! Adding this extra cash to your monthly income stream could be the boost you need to move your retirement date forward.

I believe there are a lot of variables left to play out between now and when today's grads hit 75. Following these suggestions could help get today's grads back on track to retiring on their own terms.

324,9,"“Queer” is a word with a complicated modern history – both used in a defiant chant originated by LGBTQ rights activists more than a quarter century ago to confront bigotry, and hijacked by hate-mongers doubling down on discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity.

While we have been using the “Q” in much of our work for years, HRC has now officially embraced the word’s positive evolution, joining other advocates, supporters and new-generation activists who are taking back “queer” from those who still seek to use it as a slur.

“We celebrate the journey of this word, and our movement, reclaiming with others what was once used as a cudgel against us, and recognizing the reality of how more and more LGBTQ people identify themselves,” said HRC President Chad Griffin.

In HRC’s groundbreaking 2012 survey of self-identified LGBTQ youth, hundreds of respondents used “queer” to describe their sexual orientation or ""genderqueer"" to describe their gender identity, and many others wrote in their own descriptions of more fluid identities. The reality captured by the survey prompted HRC to begin using LGBTQ in its youth-related programs and work, including HRC Foundation’s annual conference for teachers, counselors, social workers and other adults who work with LGBTQ youth.

“Queer” serves as an umbrella term that encompasses many people as it intersects with sexual orientation and gender identity. It includes anyone who does not associate with heteronormativity, rather they have non-binary or gender expansive identities."
325,9,"The ways we make purchases and conduct our financial business are changing every day and will continue to change perpetually as technology evolves.

To better understand some of the top fintech trends ahead, we sat down with Il Sun Yoo, director of data engineering at Capital One — a company long known for its data-driven pioneering moves in financial services.

""At Capital One, we are focused on reimagining banking,"" says Il Sun Yoo, Capital One's director of data engineering. ""We are innovating in a range of ways, incorporating design thinking for an empathetic customer-driven focus, leveraging big data to generate customer insights, and embracing the cloud to deliver digital products to market faster.""

As for what fintech trends are hot right now, Yoo referenced a recent survey that Capital One conducted at Money20/20, the world's leading payments and financial services innovation event.

The survey included responses from executives in payments and financial services, investments, analysts, media, government and consulting services, as well as mobile, retail integrated commerce and marketing services.

1. Biometric security is going to be big

If you're not already using your fingerprint to access devices or for security measures, you're likely to be doing so pretty soon. This makes sense, since every person's fingerprint is completely unique and nearly impossible to duplicate.

2. Same number of purchases, but with fewer cash payments

Cash used to be king, but as technology makes paperless billing more prevalent and convenient, you can expect to have more paperless payment options — and you can expect to make fewer trips to the ATM.

The ways we can gather and analyze big data are constantly improving and becoming more robust.

""Capital One has always been a data-driven company, so it was natural for Capital One to embrace big data technologies for application in the consumer banking space,"" says Yoo.

4. Better financial advice will come your way faster

Yoo says that technology and automation are decreasing friction and cost, which means financial services can become ""more and more democratized.""

""The ability to crunch more data, faster, will lead to improved financial health,"" he says.

5. Social media shopping will become more prevalent

While relatively new, shopping via social media could quickly grow in popularity. In fact, 22% of those surveyed believe that by 2030, nearly half of holiday sales transactions will be completed via social media shopping.

The following infographic has more information on the survey findings.

As the world of finance and banking continues to evolve, so does the culture and workspaces of companies in the financial industry.

Yoo works out of Capital One's New York City technology center at 114 5th Avenue, a workspace that looks more like what you would expect of a startup than a bank. The workspace is located in the epicenter of the city's ""Silicon Alley,"" an area of the city that is rife with information technology start-ups and corporations. It's an open-office environment, meant to foster a feeling of community.

""I love that our workspace has no offices for the executives,"" says Yoo. ""It says a lot about our culture and values. We also host events and meet-ups, and have an accelerator space for fintech startups, so that we can be a part of the larger tech ecosystem to help drive innovation and inclusion in banking.""

""And, our space is just fun, too,"" Yoo says. ""Table tennis is popular in the office, and the data scientists, being who they are, collect stats and determine rankings."""

You're having a totally normal night at your friend's party when the guy from across the room comes over to chat you up. You find out, shockingly, you have quite a bit in common.

After you exchange numbers, you reside in the warm habitat of possibility. He hasn't screwed anything up yet or burst your expectations.

Your ignorance to what your future with him may hold is bliss.

Once he finally texts a few days later, you're stoked. You told your friends you didn't expect to hear from him again after your short makeout sesh, but, obviously, you were lying.

You start thinking about all of the speakeasies you've been to in the past few months and mentally cataloged for first dates. Then, he drops a bomb you should have seen coming: “How about we stay in and watch a movie?”

He essentially just asked you to ""Netflix and chill."" Cue the whirlwind of thoughts that start circling through your mind.

1. A night in? He totally gets me. That's exactly what I want to do.

2. I didn't feel like getting dressed up and going out anyway.

3. What movie should we watch? What movie sets the tone for a first date?

4. It cannot be a sad movie. I can't cry in front of him. I just can't.

5. It can't be too funny, either. My laugh-snort is NOT hot.

6. Maybe we should binge-watch a TV show.

7. But if we binge-watch, how long will this date last?

8. I definitely need an out. I'll ask a friend to be on-call with a fake emergency.

9. But I'm not going to need to call her because this is my ideal date. Like, he could be my soul mate.

10. What if he's my soul mate?

11. If he is my soul mate, we need to watch something classy so our future grandchildren can be proud of us.

12. Hold on. The last guy who did this tried to get me to sleep with him. Is that what this guy is doing?

13. Ugh, he's totally pulling a Netflix and chill, isn't he? This is a booty call.

14. He should have asked me to dinner. Don't I deserve dinner?

15. When I met him at the party, was I giving off a one-and-done vibe?

16. I knew I shouldn't have made out with him.

17. But if I end up liking him, we will hook up eventually anyway.

18. He might not respect me if we hook up on a first date.

19. What if I end up genuinely liking him and then he never talks to me again?

20. I would hate him if he ghosted me.

21. It's not like I don't want to hook up with him, though. We can just keep it casual.

22. It's totally okay to do this. I don't even know for sure he's only interested in a hookup.

23. I'm going to screen-shot this text message and send it to my girlfriends. They'll know what to do.

24. Okay, they agree. I should go and feel it out. I'm telling him I'm down.

25. I guess we're going to do it at his place.

26. Correction: We're NOT going to “do it.”

27. Should I suggest hanging at my place so I can control the situation?

28. My roommates are gonna make it weird if we're here, though.

29. Are we hanging in his living room?

30. His roommates might make it weird.

31. We can always go into his bedroom.

32. Then it's really going to seem like a booty call.

33. Maybe I shouldn't shave my legs, then I won't let it go too far.

34. I should definitely shave my legs. It's a jungle down there.

35. But I will not get a wax.

36. If we order in, I'll know he's into more than a hookup.

37. Should I ask him if we're going to have food?

38. That would not be chill. I'll just eat beforehand.

39. But I'm not going to eat too much because I can't use his bathroom. And, God forbid, gas.

40. Better yet, I'll bring a snack. A snack and alcohol.

41. I wonder if he likes wine. Maybe he's more of a beer guy? Beer guys are so cute.

42. I can't drink too much. I'm a sloppy drunk.

43. But I'm really cute when I'm tipsy. I'm definitely going to get tipsy.

44. What am I going to wear?

45. I'm not going to wear a dress, or stretchy clothes.

46. I'll wear jeans and a cute top. But not too cute. We are staying in, after all.

47. Ugh, he should have taken me to dinner. Then I could have worn my top with the lace. That would have been perfect.

48. This is going to be so fun. It's going to be great. As long as we don't use my Netflix account; he can't see my recently watched list.

49. I wonder if he put this much thought into his suggestion.

51. I'm going to die alone."
330,9,"Throughout history, the medical world has constantly searched for new ways to numb pain. In the late 19th century, cocaine was discovered in medicine and first used as a form of local anesthetic.This new drug allowed doctors to perform surgeries that had never been tried before. Physicians soon saw that with the benefits came a long list of side effects including addiction. What was once an open market for cocaine and cocaine-infused products came to an end in 1914 as the federal government stopped the unregulated sale of the drug. The need to find innovative ways to dull pain continues today. In 1996, California allowed medical marijuana to be prescribed by doctors, opening up the opportunity for this controlled substance to bring relief to patients. Since then, 22 states have followed. On January 1, 2016, New York will become the next state to allow the sale of medical marijuana."
331,9,"Memorial Day Reminds Us of the Very Best in Men

It is fitting that Memorial Day falls in the middle of our current undertaking to compile stories about “the good in men.” However, many times, the solemn awe of the sacrifice by so many is difficult to put into words. The debt owed by a nation to those who have given their very best—everything, to be precise—weighs more than a value statement to be measured by human understanding.

Though, how we carry on their legacy perhaps provides the greatest meaning. From Concord and Lexington to the modern day Middle East, the men and women who have died in battle have provided us with examples of honor, valor, courage, and all the traits to which we should ascribe. The character values of the fallen are intrinsically tied to the patriotic spirit we uphold when we recognize what they have given on Memorial Day.

This weekend, as we remember our greatest heroes, one segment of the Égard Watch Company video response to Gillette carries particular meaning. A Department of Defense statistic citing how men comprise 97% of war fatalities appears as Egard’s CEO Ilan Srulovicz asks, “Is a man a hero?”

While the rows of white headstones in Arlington and national cemeteries across the country are the resounding answer to these rhetorical questions, aspects of our culture are sadly disconnected from the realities of what type of persons are memorialized in those places.

Under each headstone lies a warrior, embodying the traits of strength, bravery, and, when needed, aggression. Yet, as those decidedly masculine traits are vital in combat, the fallen soldier has exemplified so much more. Love of country, love of others, and self-sacrifice become the transcendent characteristics to a grateful nation.

By their nature, men are driven to be providers and protectors for their families, and we hope you will read the growing collection of accounts of these men we have posted here. Furthermore, we recognize that this very nature is what leads these same men to become the heroes we remember on Memorial Day. They are not here for us to thank them directly, so it is only right that we honor what they have given by remembering that they have showed us the very best in men.

333,9,"Final installment of a three-part series exploring the use of swaps, asset-based lending and foreign currency exchange to balance business risks and find opportunities.

Like many businessmen, Peter Brust starts each morning by checking stock market prices and, most importantly, the foreign exchange market. He is most interested in euros, particularly the almost constant fluctuation in the value of euros against the dollar, and can quote from memory historic rates.

“We were paying $1.35 to $1.37 for euros for the first two quarters of 2015,” he said. “Now they’re around $1.08 to $1.12.”

Brust is not a currency trader. In fact, he doesn’t want to be one. “It might be fun until the pressure gets to you,” he said. But in his role as director of accounting and finance for John Matouk & Co., a Fall River producer of fine linens and luxury bedroom and bath items, he oversees the purchase of hundreds of thousands of euros each quarter and the selling of an equivalent amount of U.S. dollars.

Many of the company’s overseas vendors insist on being paid in their native currency, usually euros, and Brust’s job is to try and reduce the impact a fluctuating euro-to-dollar rate will have on his company, which in 2015 had $25 million in sales.

So, while 120 employees in the company’s beautiful new facility are manufacturing products with raw materials from all over Europe, Brust is carefully “hedging” against the moving foreign currency by locking in rates that allow him to meet Matouk’s budget and profit expectations regardless of where the rates go.

“We only have the ability to reset our prices once a year,” he said. “So, the estimate that we make in the beginning of the year about foreign currency really does have impact on our business.”

The currency rates, highly sensitive to world events, may currently be the most volatile in history. An economic slowdown in China, falling oil prices, a sliding Dow Jones Industrial Average, and a rising dollar can all contribute to major swings in the currency rates. They all command Brust’s attention.

“When volatility is rampant, we get more calls,” said McKenna, director of foreign currency exchange at Rockland Trust. “I guess volatility is good for our business, but it’s stressful for our customers and their businesses.”

The businesses McKenna and her department deal with aren’t multinational corporations involved in massive currency trading and exchanges. They run the gamut, from the small independent firms that produce educational software, for example, to major equipment manufacturers and importers.

“I would say about 90 percent of the bank’s business customers today are doing something internationally,” said McKenna. “We work with high tech companies, shoemakers, equipment manufacturers, even a company that imports carrier pigeons. Nearly every company today has an international presence.”

The U.S. Department of Commerce said there were 10,709 companies in Massachusetts engaged in exporting in 2013, and Bay State exports totaled $27.5 billion in 2014.

Some company owners, McKenna said, hadn’t even considered the machinations and risks of overseas buying and selling when they went into business. They have come to rely on her and her department for guidance, advice and risk mitigation that far and away surpasses the simple swapping of one currency for another that her job title might suggest.

“Many find themselves in situations not knowing what to do,” she said. “We give them solutions, or maybe several possible solutions, when analyzing the current environment.”

The options for companies involved in international transactions are myriad and often complicated:
• Should I pay now for goods scheduled for delivery later, or wait to make payment?
• Should I pay in dollars or in foreign currency?
• Where is the currency expected to move?
• How will shifting currency values affect my profit margins?

“They’re in the business of making and selling products,” McKenna said. “They don’t want to get bogged down in analyzing the risks. That’s what we do.”

A simple example illustrates the challenges of selling overseas. Suppose an American company sells equipment to a buyer in France for €1 million (1 million euros). The equipment is scheduled to be delivered 90 days before the payment is made. At the time the sale was made the exchange rate was €1.25 per dollar.

At that rate, the company could expect to earn $1.25 million in gross revenues from the sale. Figuring its production and delivery costs at $1.15 million, the company could book a profit of $100,000.

However, before the company received payment, the value of the euro fell to €1.10 against the dollar and that profit became a $50,000 loss.

Of course, if the American company required the French company to make the payment in dollars instead of euros, the French company would bear the risk of euro to dollar fluctuation. But it doesn’t always work like that.

“We have several companies that sell overseas and the foreign company insists on paying in their currency,” said McKenna. “They make it a contractual obligation and that often times increases uncertainty and anxiety about where rates are going.”

To mitigate the risks associated with currency exchange many customers turn to “hedging.” Hedging is done by buying or selling foreign currency for delivery or settlement on a specific future date at a predetermined exchange rate.

“You can limit, reduce and even eliminate the risks of fluctuating rates so that element of volatility is gone,” said McKenna.

For example, 3D Incorporated, located in Weymouth MA, makes 3D printers. They import some of the parts from a company in Germany. That company invoices them in euros. Realizing the volatility in foreign exchange markets, specifically the euro, the company wants to protect its profit margin. So it enters into a hedge once a month for the euro payables. 3D has agreed to pay the German company €1 million in 60 days. So it immediately buys euros and sells US dollars with a forward contract. It locks in an exchange rate of €1.10 euros to the dollar, which will cost it $1.1 million. At this point, 3D doesn’t have to worry about the foreign exchange volatility and their profit margin is protected.

If it didn’t hedge its exposure and the euro moves just two percent, the company would have to pay $1.122 million, $22,000 more than planned.

The advantage to the hedge is that rates are locked in and there’s no guesswork or risk in losing money should the value of euro plummet. Of course, the company gives away any upside potential should the euro’s value against the dollar increase, but McKenna says most firms are more interested in simply mitigating the downside and not in playing the currency markets for gain.

“The customer has to make the decision,” she said. “If they want to keep the risk, they can. I just tell them what I’m hearing, what I’m seeing, and what the various options are.”

A recent national survey of US corporations showed that companies engaged in currency hedging saved anywhere from 10 percent to 15 percent a year on their bottom line.

That’s pretty much in line with what John Matouk & Co. saves from hedging, an estimated 17 percent last year, according to Brust. The company projects and budgets its euro purchases quarterly, rather than tying their purchases to specific vendor invoices, he said.

“So, if we were going to buy €10,000 and our budgeted rate is $1.15 [per euro], we might get a forward contract from Rockland Trust for $1.10 and lock in that rate at better margins than we expected,’’ said Brust. “So the rate might go to $1.20 or it might go to $1.05, but all we care is how we bid against our budgeted rate.”

Currency fluctuations can affect businesses in many ways. Even if a US company doesn’t compete on the international market, it can still be subject to a risk because the price of its foreign competitor’s products may be affected by a change in the exchange rate. In order to effectively compete, the US company might have to lower prices.

“Volatility has been so great lately, there are companies out there that could be doing very well, or very poorly, depending on whether they are importing or exporting, even if they are not hedging,” said McKenna. “But with these huge swings, they might sleep easier by hedging.”"
334,9,"When it comes to dishwashers, style matters.

One of the many things appliance shoppers may be unaware of when hunting for a new dishwasher is that today's dishwashers come in not just two main styles, but many. There's an ongoing debate in consumer forums between American and European dishwasher styles, which, up until the last few years, offer a very different set of features and benefits. European style dishwashers (by brands like Bosch) feature stainless interiors, fewer cycle settings, better energy efficiency and lower noise levels; while American style dishwashers by brands like Whirlpool offered flexible cycle settings and heated dry options.

Although the debate between European vs. American style dishwashers continues, the reality is that today the lines have blurred between these styles, leaving a variety of options in both categories. For example, most American-style dishwashers today have stainless interior tubs, are much more efficient and operate with less noise; while most European-style dishwashers have added a variety of cycle settings. In short: many of what are considered standard European features are available in American brand dishwashers, and many American features are made by European brands.

""The truth is that most brands carry dishwashers with features that will appeal to most people. The conversation is now about finding the right model that has the features and benefits that meet your specific needs,"" said Scott Bekins, owner and president of local appliance and electronics retailer, Bekins.

Bosch leads the charge in merging American and European styles

As the largest European dishwasher manufacturer, Bosch is used in more homes across America than any other European dishwasher brand. Bosch has also won the most awards from JD Power & Associates for customer satisfaction. Looking at how the American dishwasher market has responded to Bosch's presence over the years, there's no doubt that customer satisfaction with Bosch dishwashers has influenced American manufacturers in adopting many of the positive features of European dishwashers - Bosch specifically.

As consumer preferences indicate, Bosch stands out as one of the most feature-rich and affordable of the European brands, according to local appliance expert Richard Tease. ""You will generally pay less for more features with Bosch,"" said Tease, who is an Appliance Sales Professional at Bekins in Grand Haven.

The debate between heated vs. condensation dry evaporates

Traditionally, American style dishwashers used a heater to dry dishes after the wash cycle (""heated dry""), while European styles relied on a draft of cold external air and hot stainless interiors to dry dishes using condensation (a process called ""condensation dry""). The results were an effective, but energy-consuming dry cycle, in American styles, and an energy-efficient, but less effective, dry cycle in European styles.

Today, however, condensation dry and heated dry represent more of a spectrum than two distinct options. Almost all dishwashers use a heater - including European styles. Similarly, most American dishwashers have stainless interiors, which allow for condensation. Bosch's dishwashers, for example, use the heater for one minute to kick-start its ""condensation dry"" cycle, while KitchenAid uses a combination of condensation and heated dry. The result is a spectrum of dry cycle options, which suit a variety of different lifestyles.

Shifting energy regulations have significantly heightened energy and water efficiency standards across the appliance industry, including both American and European dishwashers. As a result, the difference in energy efficiency between European and American style dishwashers is negligible today.

What most consumers don't know, however, is that along with higher energy efficiency often comes less heat - and therefore less deep sanitization. John Ritzema, Appliance Sales Professional at Bekins in Grand Rapids, says that's one of the reasons he recommends using the ""sanitize"" option when it's available. ""That sanitizes the dishes, but it also gets them as hot as possible, which will get them as dry as possible during condensation dry,"" said Ritzema.

Along with greater energy efficiency comes less noise, in both categories. While dishwashers across both American and European styles are getting quieter, Bosch's dishwashers, remain among the quietest in the industry, with its dishwashers consistently being ranked as quietest among its peers by Consumer Reports.

Drying method and noise aside, both European and American brands often carry additional features, which the right shopper may find invaluable. A dishwasher's style matters less than what specific features the brand offers, emphasized Tease, Bekins' appliance expert.

""Bosch, for example, is one of the few dishwasher brands that can fit flush with your cabinets after custom paneling is applied,"" said Tease. ""That makes it a very popular model for integrated kitchen remodels and new home construction. It all depends on what you need.""

Bosch's dishwashers also include a feature called ""24/7 AquaStop"". This automatically senses any leaks that may occur, then shuts the water off and immediately pumps it out to ensure the dishwasher doesn't empty its contents onto the floor. For those who have had to replace flooring due to dishwasher leaks, this feature alone could be worth the investment.

""Some higher end Bosch models also include water softeners,"" said Tease. ""For families with hard water, this can be a very important feature.""

Bosch dishwashers begin at $499, going up to $2199 at the top of their premium Benchmark line. Popular American brands Whirlpool and KitchenAid are priced comparably, starting at $329 and going up to $1999."

336,9,"WASHINGTON – Today, the Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) unveiled amendments to the Cuban Assets Control Regulations (CACR) to further implement the President’s foreign policy on Cuba. These amendments complement changes to the Department of Commerce’s Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) Export Administration Regulations (EAR), which Commerce is also unveiling today. These regulatory changes were announced on April 17, 2019 and include restrictions on non-family travel to Cuba.

“Cuba continues to play a destabilizing role in the Western Hemisphere, providing a communist foothold in the region and propping up U.S. adversaries in places like Venezuela and Nicaragua by fomenting instability, undermining the rule of law, and suppressing democratic processes,” said Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin. “This Administration has made a strategic decision to reverse the loosening of sanctions and other restrictions on the Cuban regime. These actions will help to keep U.S. dollars out of the hands of Cuban military, intelligence, and security services.”

These actions mark a continued commitment towards implementing the National Security Presidential Memorandum signed by the President on June 16, 2017 titled “Strengthening the Policy of the United States Toward Cuba.” These policies continue to work to channel economic activities away from the Cuban military, intelligence, and security services. The Treasury changes will take effect on June 5, 2019 when the regulations are published in the Federal Register.

For the Treasury regulations, which can be found at 31 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) part 515, see here. For the Commerce regulations, which can be found at 15 CFR parts 730-774, see here. Major elements of the changes in the revised regulations include:
• In accordance with the newly announced changes to non-family travel to Cuba, OFAC is amending the regulations to remove the authorization for group people-to-people educational travel. OFAC’s regulatory changes include a “grandfathering” provision, which provides that certain group people-to-people educational travel that previously was authorized will continue to be authorized where the traveler had already completed at least one travel-related transaction (such as purchasing a flight or reserving accommodation) prior to June 5, 2019. Please note that travel-related transactions continue to be permitted by general licenses for certain categories of travel and certain authorized export transactions. For more on authorized travel to Cuba, please click here.
• BIS, in coordination with OFAC, is amending the EAR to make passenger and recreational vessels and private and corporate aircraft ineligible for a license exception and to establish a general policy of denial for license applications involving those vessels and aircraft.

341,9,"Free-Market Leader Condemns Software Giant’s Posturing Against Religious Liberty and the Second Amendment



San Francisco, CA/Washington, D.C. – Software giant Salesforce has rejected a shareholder resolution designed to encourage a diverse balance of thought on the tech giant’s left-leaning board of directors.

The vote came in response to a shareholder proposal submitted by Free Enterprise Project (FEP) Director Justin Danhof, Esq., at yesterday’s annual meeting of Salesforce investors held in San Francisco, California. Danhof’s proposal noted that “[d]iversity isn’t what someone looks like. It’s the sum of what that person thinks, feels and believes. When the company takes overtly political positions on legal and policy issues, it would benefit from having voices from both sides of the aisle in the room.”

The full text of the proposal is available on page 72 of Salesforce’s proxy, available here.

“Salesforce has become one of the nation’s most influential companies over the past decade. Unfortunately, the tech giant is using its outsized power as a weapon of left-wing social engineering,” said Danhof.

* The company threatened to divest from the state of Georgia over that state’s consideration of a religious freedom restoration law, falsely suggesting that the measure was designed to discriminate against the LGBT community. * The company also signed the Human Rights Campaign’s (HRC) highly disingenuous amicus brief in the Masterpiece Cakeshop, Ltd. v. Colorado Civil Rights Commission U.S. Supreme Court case. The company’s position would have allowed states to compel speech of private businesses and citizens all while further eroding religious freedom. * And the Washington Post recently reported that Salesforce has instituted a new policy taking aim at the 2nd Amendment. Specifically, the company is barring its clients that sell certain guns, clients such as Camping World, “from using its technology to market products, manage customer service operations and fulfill orders.” This could damage the company, as existing clients may leave and new clients may consider other software options.

Whether you’re willing to admit your bias is beyond the point. In business, perception is often reality. And our proposal provides a tangible way for the company to combat its bias. We believe that boards that incorporate diverse perspectives can think more critically and oversee corporate managers more effectively. Appointing a few conservatives may help the company avoid groupthink. That’s a win for investors and a win for true diversity.

The full text of Danhof’s statement, as prepared for delivery, is available here. Audio of Danhof’s statement is available here.

“I was encouraged that one of the board members approached me to thank me for my statement and suggest he was in agreement with us,” noted Danhof. “However, when it comes to Salesforce’s left-leaning public policy positions, it seems his voice isn’t being heard inside the boardroom.

“You don’t need laws to upend the culture,” continued Danhof. “Salesforce is working to upend commerce and culture in ways that shift society further to the left. Religious Americans, gun rights supporters and conservatives need to do a much better job of reaching out to these left-wing corporate actors in the same way that liberal activists do. Until we do that, the corporate march to the left will continue largely unabated.”

Yesterday was the seventh time FEP has presented a board diversity resolution at a corporate shareholder meeting this year. FEP has also called upon Apple, Starbucks, Discovery, Twitter, Amazon and Facebook to increase ideological diversity on their left-leaning boards.

Yesterday’s Salesforce meeting marks the 25th time FEP has participated in a shareholder meeting in 2019.

Launched in 2007, the National Center’s Free Enterprise Project focuses on shareholder activism and the confluence of big government and big business. Over the past four years alone, FEP representatives have participated in over 100 shareholder meetings – advancing free-market ideals about health care, energy, taxes, subsidies, regulations, religious freedom, food policies, media bias, gun rights, workers’ rights and other important public policy issues. As the leading voice for conservative-minded investors, FEP annually files more than 90 percent of all right-of-center shareholder resolutions. Dozens of liberal organizations, however, annually file more than 95 percent of all policy-oriented shareholder resolutions and continue to exert undue influence over corporate America.

FEP activity has been covered by media outlets including the New York Times, Washington Post, USA Today, Variety, the Associated Press, Bloomberg, Drudge Report, Business Insider, National Public Radio and SiriusXM. FEP’s work was prominently featured in Wall Street Journal writer Kimberley Strassel’s 2016 book The Intimidation Game: How the Left is Silencing Free Speech (Hachette Book Group).

Earlier this year, Investor’s Business Daily published an op-ed by Danhof regarding the capitulation of Amazon, Facebook and Alphabet to liberal diversity pushers. It is available here.

343,9,"Final installment of a three-part series exploring the use of swaps, asset-based lending and foreign currency exchange to balance business risks and find opportunities.

Like many businessmen, Peter Brust starts each morning by checking stock market prices and, most importantly, the foreign exchange market. He is most interested in euros, particularly the almost constant fluctuation in the value of euros against the dollar, and can quote from memory historic rates.

“We were paying $1.35 to $1.37 for euros for the first two quarters of 2015,” he said. “Now they’re around $1.08 to $1.12.”

Brust is not a currency trader. In fact, he doesn’t want to be one. “It might be fun until the pressure gets to you,” he said. But in his role as director of accounting and finance for John Matouk & Co., a Fall River producer of fine linens and luxury bedroom and bath items, he oversees the purchase of hundreds of thousands of euros each quarter and the selling of an equivalent amount of U.S. dollars.

Many of the company’s overseas vendors insist on being paid in their native currency, usually euros, and Brust’s job is to try and reduce the impact a fluctuating euro-to-dollar rate will have on his company, which in 2015 had $25 million in sales.

So, while 120 employees in the company’s beautiful new facility are manufacturing products with raw materials from all over Europe, Brust is carefully “hedging” against the moving foreign currency by locking in rates that allow him to meet Matouk’s budget and profit expectations regardless of where the rates go.

“We only have the ability to reset our prices once a year,” he said. “So, the estimate that we make in the beginning of the year about foreign currency really does have impact on our business.”

The currency rates, highly sensitive to world events, may currently be the most volatile in history. An economic slowdown in China, falling oil prices, a sliding Dow Jones Industrial Average, and a rising dollar can all contribute to major swings in the currency rates. They all command Brust’s attention.

“When volatility is rampant, we get more calls,” said McKenna, director of foreign currency exchange at Rockland Trust. “I guess volatility is good for our business, but it’s stressful for our customers and their businesses.”

The businesses McKenna and her department deal with aren’t multinational corporations involved in massive currency trading and exchanges. They run the gamut, from the small independent firms that produce educational software, for example, to major equipment manufacturers and importers.

“I would say about 90 percent of the bank’s business customers today are doing something internationally,” said McKenna. “We work with high tech companies, shoemakers, equipment manufacturers, even a company that imports carrier pigeons. Nearly every company today has an international presence.”

The U.S. Department of Commerce said there were 10,709 companies in Massachusetts engaged in exporting in 2013, and Bay State exports totaled $27.5 billion in 2014.

Some company owners, McKenna said, hadn’t even considered the machinations and risks of overseas buying and selling when they went into business. They have come to rely on her and her department for guidance, advice and risk mitigation that far and away surpasses the simple swapping of one currency for another that her job title might suggest.

“Many find themselves in situations not knowing what to do,” she said. “We give them solutions, or maybe several possible solutions, when analyzing the current environment.”

The options for companies involved in international transactions are myriad and often complicated:
• Should I pay now for goods scheduled for delivery later, or wait to make payment?
• Should I pay in dollars or in foreign currency?
• Where is the currency expected to move?
• How will shifting currency values affect my profit margins?

“They’re in the business of making and selling products,” McKenna said. “They don’t want to get bogged down in analyzing the risks. That’s what we do.”

A simple example illustrates the challenges of selling overseas. Suppose an American company sells equipment to a buyer in France for €1 million (1 million euros). The equipment is scheduled to be delivered 90 days before the payment is made. At the time the sale was made the exchange rate was €1.25 per dollar.

At that rate, the company could expect to earn $1.25 million in gross revenues from the sale. Figuring its production and delivery costs at $1.15 million, the company could book a profit of $100,000.

However, before the company received payment, the value of the euro fell to €1.10 against the dollar and that profit became a $50,000 loss.

Of course, if the American company required the French company to make the payment in dollars instead of euros, the French company would bear the risk of euro to dollar fluctuation. But it doesn’t always work like that.

“We have several companies that sell overseas and the foreign company insists on paying in their currency,” said McKenna. “They make it a contractual obligation and that often times increases uncertainty and anxiety about where rates are going.”

To mitigate the risks associated with currency exchange many customers turn to “hedging.” Hedging is done by buying or selling foreign currency for delivery or settlement on a specific future date at a predetermined exchange rate.

“You can limit, reduce and even eliminate the risks of fluctuating rates so that element of volatility is gone,” said McKenna.

For example, 3D Incorporated, located in Weymouth MA, makes 3D printers. They import some of the parts from a company in Germany. That company invoices them in euros. Realizing the volatility in foreign exchange markets, specifically the euro, the company wants to protect its profit margin. So it enters into a hedge once a month for the euro payables. 3D has agreed to pay the German company €1 million in 60 days. So it immediately buys euros and sells US dollars with a forward contract. It locks in an exchange rate of €1.10 euros to the dollar, which will cost it $1.1 million. At this point, 3D doesn’t have to worry about the foreign exchange volatility and their profit margin is protected.

If it didn’t hedge its exposure and the euro moves just two percent, the company would have to pay $1.122 million, $22,000 more than planned.

The advantage to the hedge is that rates are locked in and there’s no guesswork or risk in losing money should the value of euro plummet. Of course, the company gives away any upside potential should the euro’s value against the dollar increase, but McKenna says most firms are more interested in simply mitigating the downside and not in playing the currency markets for gain.

“The customer has to make the decision,” she said. “If they want to keep the risk, they can. I just tell them what I’m hearing, what I’m seeing, and what the various options are.”

A recent national survey of US corporations showed that companies engaged in currency hedging saved anywhere from 10 percent to 15 percent a year on their bottom line.

That’s pretty much in line with what John Matouk & Co. saves from hedging, an estimated 17 percent last year, according to Brust. The company projects and budgets its euro purchases quarterly, rather than tying their purchases to specific vendor invoices, he said.

“So, if we were going to buy €10,000 and our budgeted rate is $1.15 [per euro], we might get a forward contract from Rockland Trust for $1.10 and lock in that rate at better margins than we expected,’’ said Brust. “So the rate might go to $1.20 or it might go to $1.05, but all we care is how we bid against our budgeted rate.”

Currency fluctuations can affect businesses in many ways. Even if a US company doesn’t compete on the international market, it can still be subject to a risk because the price of its foreign competitor’s products may be affected by a change in the exchange rate. In order to effectively compete, the US company might have to lower prices.

“Volatility has been so great lately, there are companies out there that could be doing very well, or very poorly, depending on whether they are importing or exporting, even if they are not hedging,” said McKenna. “But with these huge swings, they might sleep easier by hedging.”"
344,9," -- President Obama said today that he does not believe GOP frontrunner Donald Trump will make it to the White House, but the real estate mogul took the remark as a compliment, saying Obama has done a ""lousy job.""

""I continue to believe Mr. Trump will not be president,"" Obama said while speaking at a press conference in Rancho Mirage, California. ""And the reason is because I have a lot of faith in the American people.""

Obama told reporters he believed Americans still see the presidency as ""a serious job.""

“It’s not hosting a talk show, or a reality show. It’s not promotion, it’s not marketing,” Obama said. “It’s hard and a lot of people count on us getting it right.”

Obama did not, however, answer whether he believed Trump was capable of securing the GOP nomination.

The president also took a shot at the rest of the GOP field, saying “foreign observers are troubled” by the GOP's rhetoric, specifically the doubting of climate change and proposals to ban Muslims from entering the U.S.

Trump, speaking at a campaign event in South Carolina, immediately hit back, saying Obama is doing a ""lousy job.""

""He has set us back so far, and for him to actually say that is a great compliment, if you want to know the truth,"" Trump said."

346,9,"This is the first article in a four-part special advertising feature series presented by Mazda that looks at the ongoing relationship between technology, innovation and sport.

Technical innovation in sport - it's something we as participants and fans take for granted now. It could be Grand Prix champion Lewis Hamilton talking to his pit crew throughout his thrilling drive in Austin Texas to win the 2015 Formula One title. Or improvements in the safety standards of cricketers' helmets, following the death of Australian Test batsman Phillip Hughes when a delivery struck him at the top of his neck, in Sydney in 2014.

Perhaps the most interesting development is the introduction of ingestible computers that constantly transmit data on a player's vital functions, such as blood pressure and body temperature. Athletes in sports as diverse as motor sport, athletics, football and hockey are already using them. It's the latest innovation in the ever-changing world of sports technology.

Move Like Never Before If you look at the many incredible achievements of the modern world, chances are you'll find it's a result of a potent combination of innovation and technology. This combination lets us live and move like never before. Mazda's innovation and technology has allowed them to develop the Mazda CX-3.

Let's turn the clock back more than 70 years, when one of sport's greatest innovations evolved from a bitter feud between two brothers. Adi and Rudi Dassler were partners in a sports shoe company in Herzogenaurach, Germany. After an acrimonious split , the brothers formed rival companies - Adidas and Puma - on opposite sides of the river Aurach.

The schism inspired a battle for domination in athletic footwear - firstly in newly formed West Germany, and then the rest of the world. It led to a race to find styles and materials that gave top athletes the slightest advantage. Manufacturers are still in a fight for domination, with the global market tipped to be worth US$84.4 billion in 2018. Amazingly, Adidas and Puma are still up there fighting for their share of the lucrative sports shoe market, along with Nike, Reebok and other companies.

The only objective is to win - to be bigger, stronger, faster … smarter.

Athletes, teams and sports organisations will always seek to find an edge over their rivals (or the stopwatch). It might be the chance to gain a physical advantage through better training techniques, or a mental edge through superior tactics. Or it might be through playing with equipment that allows them to go faster, with more comfort and safety, for longer. At the 2015 Tour de France, for example, cyclists carried miniature GPS-equipped computers that tracked speed, distance travelled and calories burned.

Technology continues to be crucial factor in any individual or team success, especially at the elite level. And as every player or team finds an advantage, opponents try to counter it. This sports innovation cycle has made billionaires of entrepreneurs in the sports equipment industry, and created jobs for sports scientists and psychologists who deliver stunning results for athletes, teams and sponsors.

The push for sporting innovation has also given spectators the chance to be more involved in the action. Using miniature, high-speed and even infrared cameras and ultra-sensitive microphones, broadcasters and sports organisations bring fans closer to the action. Intimacy equals greater ratings and sponsorship money.

When Tennis legend John McEnroe screamed 'You Cannot Be Serious' at the Umpire while contesting a decision, it added to the excitement for the Wimbledon crowd. With the introduction of Hawk-Eye in Grand Slams in 2006, we may have lost some of the human drama, but we've gained a near-faultless ball-tracking technology that enjoys the support of most players and officials. Many sporting organisations, including the NFL in the US, and the Rugby Union authorities at the recent World Cup in England, use ""slo-mo"" video technology as part of their on-field decision-making, while their officials use it to determine if players should be suspended for foul play.

Technology has also had a fundamental impact on the way players train. Cutting-edge training facilities are a home away from home for elite athletes, who rely on sophisticated machines and monitors to reach peak performance while averting the risk of injury. Sports scientists use technology to develop training regimes that allow individual athletes to perform at their best.

Modern technology also allows sports to find future stars, with talented teenagers tested to determine which disciplines best suit their physiology. These days, star rowers are discovered before they even step onto a boat. But some sports testing is less about finding champions and more about exposing cheats. World anti-drug agencies strive - with varying degrees of success - to develop sophisticated tests to uncover athletes and coaches who are seeking an unfair chemical advantage.

Technology has also revolutionised sports psychology. What gives players confidence, awareness, courage? How do players stop being complacent, fearful, nervous? Psychologists have learnt the answer is different for every athlete. Visualisation techniques, where players ""see"" a successful outcome before it happens, are practised by athletes at all levels.

Managers and coaches increasingly use technology to help with tactics, in real time. In cricket, ball-tracking software helps bowlers find weaknesses in batting techniques. And in Australian Rules Football, live statistics help coaches find players who are getting beaten by their opponents.

Motor sport is an industry almost entirely based on technology. Grand Prix racing takes this to the furthest reaches, with competitors looking for any edge that will bring them faster lap times measurable to one-thousandth of a second. Engine and chassis information is available in real time for drivers, team managers and pit crews. This information is available to fans watching on television or on their computers or mobile devices.

Consumers are the ultimate winners when innovations trickle down from elite competition. Motor sport has improved the efficiency and safety of road cars, and continues to be a test bed for technology. In the same way that disc brakes, advanced four-wheel drive systems and turbochargers were developed in the motor-sport crucible decades ago, the world's smartest engineers are refining hybrid engine technology, synthetic oils and fuels to improve the cars we will drive in the future.

This principle applies in all sports. The same state-of-the-art composite racquet Novak Djokovic used to win Wimbledon will win the mixed doubles final at the local tennis club. Golf equipment manufacturers, forced to abide by a strict set of global rules for elite and amateur players, endeavour to design clubs that help hackers hit the ball straighter and longer.

What of the future? Some say we're entering the age of 'smart wearables' technology, with athletes competing in outfits that transmit performance data in real time. Others believe that nanotechnology will transform the way everyday sporting equipment is made, making it stronger, lighter and easier to use. Hopefully, we will continue to be the beneficiaries of these advances, both as amateur competitors whose clothing and equipment are constantly improving, and as armchair fans whose enjoyment of sport is given a boost by the latest revolutionary technological advance."
347,9,"Top treatments, new breakthroughs, education and lifestyle changes are winning the battle against heart disease

In the not-so-distant past, patients suffering from heart disease had a very different experience than patients do today. As recently as a couple decades ago, heart attack patients were likely admitted to a hospital’s coronary care unit where doctors could monitor the patient but didn’t have a lot of options when it came to saving the heart muscle, according to Kirit Patel, M.D., medical director of the cardiac catheterization lab and chief of division of cardiology at St. Joseph Mercy Oakland.

“Twenty-five to 30 years ago there were no stents available and we didn’t even know to give aspirin to heart attack patients,” Patel says. “Now, patients have angioplasty or stents and go home the next day. That’s how fast technology has moved.”

Today – although angioplasty, stents and other artery-opening procedures are still widely used – cardiovascular treatment has changed, with more of a focus on advanced minimally invasive procedures that have transformed heart disease from a possible death sentence to a treatable condition that patients live with for years.

“[In the past,] treatment was driven by coronary artery blockages. Emergency procedures, angiograms, stents and open-heart surgery were 85 percent of what we did,” says William W. O’Neill, M.D., medical director of the Center for Structural Heart Disease at the Henry Ford Heart and Vascular Institute. “The good news is the epidemic is abating and we are seeing fewer heart attacks. We have patients now with coronary artery disease who are relatively stable.”

That means doctors are treating older patients – even in their 90s – and seeing conditions that used to be somewhat rare become more prominent.

“We are seeing more patients with atrial fibrillation, a condition that one-third of those over the age of 80 have,” O’Neill says. “There’s also more valvular disease because as we age, our valves wear out. There used to be a lot of open-heart surgeries, but now there are a wide variety of ways to fix the heart without open-heart surgery. That’s where it’s at now.”

Those in the medical profession expect research and technology will continue to move at a rapid pace, according to Tom Davis, M.D., medical director for cardiovascular research and the cardiac catheterization labs at St. John Hospital and Medical Center.

“We are reinventing ourselves every five years,” Davis says. “Everything I do today is completely different than when I started in 1993.”

Davis says he expects to see a continued push to minimally invasive strategies to treat heart patients.

“I expect soon we will see more heart surgeries done in an outpatient setting,” he says. “There will be shorter procedures and the patient will go home the same day.”

O’Neill says regenerating heart muscles with stem cell therapy and tissue engineering, where parts such as valves will be individually made using 3D models, are also on the horizon.

“This is not science fiction or something that is light years away,” he says. “It’s very realistic that we will see these procedures 10 years from now.”

A new class of LDL-cholesterol-lowering drugs called PCSK9 inhibitors, which don’t have the side effects of statins, will also be a game-changer, O’Neill says. Though the injectable drug is quite expensive – about $14,000 for a one-year supply – and only currently FDA-approved for those with familial hypercholesterolemia, a genetic condition that causes up to three times the normal level of LDL cholesterol, and certain patients who require more lowering of LDL than they are getting with statins, O’Neill says he expects all that to change in the near future.

“These drugs can dramatically lower cholesterol,” he says. “If there is widespread use, we will see coronary artery disease disappear from society.”

348,9,"I’m in my fifth year of living in New York City, and I know I still haven’t taken advantage of everything the city has to offer. I haven’t explored the reaches of all five boroughs. I haven’t seen all the landmarks. I haven’t soaked up all the culture there is to soak.

Yet my boyfriend is a born-and-bred NYC local, and while I would have thought that he’s been everywhere there is to go. In reality, I’ve actually shown him some spots that he had never visited before.

It’s almost impossible to be an expert on your home city. There are so many different neighborhoods; new, must-visit locations open every day. Every local you talk to has a different set of favorite places. It can be totally overwhelming.

But if you really want to get to know your urban home, there’s one foolproof way to do it: dining out. Nothing beats the authenticity of a local restaurant.

Here are six reasons dining out is the best way to explore your city:

You need a reason to leave your neighborhood.

In the winter months, we look out the window, and all we can do is sigh. It’s gloomy and cold – two adjectives that are screaming, “Stay home!” We’re inclined to keep to our little bubbles and not venture out of our neighborhoods for anything beyond work.

A good restaurant recommendation can change all of that, though. If you hear that there’s great paella on the other side of town, your taste buds NEED to trek there. If your best friend is stoked about the curry in a different borough, you HAVE to try it.

We will travel anywhere for a good meal. And in the process, we’re walking through new neighborhoods we wouldn’t otherwise see. It could inspire us to find a new favorite street, or even move to a new area.

Visiting iconic establishments makes you a part of your city’s history.

There are certain haunts in every city that each generation of inhabitants has visited.

If you ask your grandmother where to go, she might tell you to try the old Italian place with the 100-year-old Ragu recipe. Talk to your parents, and they’ll send you to the burger place that opened in the 1950s.

Hitting up these restaurants is the best way to connect to older generations, in and out of your family. It also makes you a part of the fabric of your metropolis.

It’s an invitation to experience the different subcultures of your city.

When you cook for yourself, you cook what you know. If you were raised on spaghetti and meatballs, that’s the recipe you’re using at the end of the day.

The beauty of eating out is trying the different cultures your city houses. Mediterranean, Indian, Hawaiian, Ethiopian – it’s all there for the tasting. It’s the most delicious way to expand your horizons.

Restaurants are the best locations for people watching.

Restaurants are the city equivalent of a safari watering hole. Different types of characters come out at night, seeking sustenance. You see them all when you’re eating out.

People-watching is basically a sport when you live in a city. You look around and ascribe fictional backgrounds to the eclectic mix of people you see. It’s a free dose of fun served up with your meal.

Being a regular is the ideal way to be part of your community.

There is no better feeling than walking into a restaurant or coffee shop and the staff greeting you with open arms. If they know your name, that’s a plus. If they know your order, that’s a major plus.

Being a regular connects to your community. You know not only the staff, but also the other regulars. You start seeing them around the neighborhood as you run errands, and you give each other a nod. Knowing how the other takes their coffee has bonded you.

You were hungry anyway.

Let’s be honest: In your life, you’re basically just filling time in between meals. You are stoked when someone suggests it might be time to eat.

So when you eat out, it’s a chance to merge your insatiable hunger with a social activity. Why play a round of mini-golf with friends when you can all break bread together? Especially if you get a good deal on a prix fixe meal.

You and your friends will never regret a night out on the town with a good meal. It’s the best way to fulfill your need to be cultured and fed."
350,9,"When it comes to the milk America drinks, cows shouldn't get all the credit. Dairy farmers like Dave and Laurie Kyle of Elkhorn, Wis., put in just as much hard work as their bovine counterparts.

Morning for these dairy producers starts early. By 4:30, the Kyles and their farmhands are up for the first of two rounds of milking their 110 registered Holstein cows. While the cows are in the milking parlor, Dave is busy cleaning the barn, replenishing bedding and filling watering units with fresh water. Next, it's time to feed the girls a nutritious breakfast of farm-grown hay, corn and silage (a high-moisture feed that is often made from grass crops that provides many of the nutrients present in plants) mixed with soybean meal and Milwaukee malted rye. (During the warmer months, the cows also graze on fresh pasture.) Dave meets with a local nutritionist weekly, and feed blends are customized to meet each cow's current dietary needs, based on her weight and milk production level. Afternoons are more varied, yet still just as busy. In the summer, it's often the time to hop on the tractor and harvest feed crops. When the Kyles aren't harvesting, they'll often tend to other tasks, such as any variety of farm-related repairs.

""When you're a farmer, you have to be good at being an electrician, plumber and mechanic, because you can't really afford to pay outside vendors,"" Laurie admits.

There's also checking in with veterinarians and testing milk for quality and safety. This includes testing for antibiotic residues — a process that takes place up to eight times before the milk is sent to the local processing plant. Setting aside time each day to simply observe the cows' behavior is also essential to ensure that they're healthy. On some days, the Kyles give farm tours, too. ""It's cool to see kids' faces light up when they pet the calves that were born a week ago, because most families don't know where their food comes from,"" says Laurie.

While Dave spends much of his day on the farm, Laurie, a nutrition educator, can usually be found at Perkup Elkhorn, the coffee shop she opened in 2012 to forge deeper community connections and earn additional income. ""Because I'm passionate about agriculture and healthy eating, it seemed like a perfect fit. The message that I have is that American agriculture is alive and well, and farmers are still some of the most trustworthy individuals that are providing wholesome products for all,"" she says. When she isn't chatting with customers about milk's vast nutritional benefits, she's tackling bookwork for the farm in the back office.

Dave might stop in for a bit to discuss bills, but it's back to the farm by 4:30 p.m. for the day's second round of milking, cleaning and feeding. After working as long as 17 hours, he finally arrives back home. Like most families, long days and busy schedules—including working around 16-year-old daughter Mackenzie’s travel softball games and practices and 20-year-old son Hayden’s college course load—mean the Kyles don't get to eat dinner together as often as they might like. But it's a small sacrifice to make in exchange for a truly rewarding outcome. ""Knowing you're producing wholesome products for people and doing it by rolling up your sleeves and working hard, there's a real pride involved in that,"" says Laurie."
351,9,"Final installment of a three-part series exploring the use of swaps, asset-based lending and foreign currency exchange to balance business risks and find opportunities.

Like many businessmen, Peter Brust starts each morning by checking stock market prices and, most importantly, the foreign exchange market. He is most interested in euros, particularly the almost constant fluctuation in the value of euros against the dollar, and can quote from memory historic rates.

“We were paying $1.35 to $1.37 for euros for the first two quarters of 2015,” he said. “Now they’re around $1.08 to $1.12.”

Brust is not a currency trader. In fact, he doesn’t want to be one. “It might be fun until the pressure gets to you,” he said. But in his role as director of accounting and finance for John Matouk & Co., a Fall River producer of fine linens and luxury bedroom and bath items, he oversees the purchase of hundreds of thousands of euros each quarter and the selling of an equivalent amount of U.S. dollars.

Many of the company’s overseas vendors insist on being paid in their native currency, usually euros, and Brust’s job is to try and reduce the impact a fluctuating euro-to-dollar rate will have on his company, which in 2015 had $25 million in sales.

So, while 120 employees in the company’s beautiful new facility are manufacturing products with raw materials from all over Europe, Brust is carefully “hedging” against the moving foreign currency by locking in rates that allow him to meet Matouk’s budget and profit expectations regardless of where the rates go.

“We only have the ability to reset our prices once a year,” he said. “So, the estimate that we make in the beginning of the year about foreign currency really does have impact on our business.”

The currency rates, highly sensitive to world events, may currently be the most volatile in history. An economic slowdown in China, falling oil prices, a sliding Dow Jones Industrial Average, and a rising dollar can all contribute to major swings in the currency rates. They all command Brust’s attention.

“When volatility is rampant, we get more calls,” said McKenna, director of foreign currency exchange at Rockland Trust. “I guess volatility is good for our business, but it’s stressful for our customers and their businesses.”

The businesses McKenna and her department deal with aren’t multinational corporations involved in massive currency trading and exchanges. They run the gamut, from the small independent firms that produce educational software, for example, to major equipment manufacturers and importers.

“I would say about 90 percent of the bank’s business customers today are doing something internationally,” said McKenna. “We work with high tech companies, shoemakers, equipment manufacturers, even a company that imports carrier pigeons. Nearly every company today has an international presence.”

The U.S. Department of Commerce said there were 10,709 companies in Massachusetts engaged in exporting in 2013, and Bay State exports totaled $27.5 billion in 2014.

Some company owners, McKenna said, hadn’t even considered the machinations and risks of overseas buying and selling when they went into business. They have come to rely on her and her department for guidance, advice and risk mitigation that far and away surpasses the simple swapping of one currency for another that her job title might suggest.

“Many find themselves in situations not knowing what to do,” she said. “We give them solutions, or maybe several possible solutions, when analyzing the current environment.”

The options for companies involved in international transactions are myriad and often complicated:
• Should I pay now for goods scheduled for delivery later, or wait to make payment?
• Should I pay in dollars or in foreign currency?
• Where is the currency expected to move?
• How will shifting currency values affect my profit margins?

“They’re in the business of making and selling products,” McKenna said. “They don’t want to get bogged down in analyzing the risks. That’s what we do.”

A simple example illustrates the challenges of selling overseas. Suppose an American company sells equipment to a buyer in France for €1 million (1 million euros). The equipment is scheduled to be delivered 90 days before the payment is made. At the time the sale was made the exchange rate was €1.25 per dollar.

At that rate, the company could expect to earn $1.25 million in gross revenues from the sale. Figuring its production and delivery costs at $1.15 million, the company could book a profit of $100,000.

However, before the company received payment, the value of the euro fell to €1.10 against the dollar and that profit became a $50,000 loss.

Of course, if the American company required the French company to make the payment in dollars instead of euros, the French company would bear the risk of euro to dollar fluctuation. But it doesn’t always work like that.

“We have several companies that sell overseas and the foreign company insists on paying in their currency,” said McKenna. “They make it a contractual obligation and that often times increases uncertainty and anxiety about where rates are going.”

To mitigate the risks associated with currency exchange many customers turn to “hedging.” Hedging is done by buying or selling foreign currency for delivery or settlement on a specific future date at a predetermined exchange rate.

“You can limit, reduce and even eliminate the risks of fluctuating rates so that element of volatility is gone,” said McKenna.

For example, 3D Incorporated, located in Weymouth MA, makes 3D printers. They import some of the parts from a company in Germany. That company invoices them in euros. Realizing the volatility in foreign exchange markets, specifically the euro, the company wants to protect its profit margin. So it enters into a hedge once a month for the euro payables. 3D has agreed to pay the German company €1 million in 60 days. So it immediately buys euros and sells US dollars with a forward contract. It locks in an exchange rate of €1.10 euros to the dollar, which will cost it $1.1 million. At this point, 3D doesn’t have to worry about the foreign exchange volatility and their profit margin is protected.

If it didn’t hedge its exposure and the euro moves just two percent, the company would have to pay $1.122 million, $22,000 more than planned.

The advantage to the hedge is that rates are locked in and there’s no guesswork or risk in losing money should the value of euro plummet. Of course, the company gives away any upside potential should the euro’s value against the dollar increase, but McKenna says most firms are more interested in simply mitigating the downside and not in playing the currency markets for gain.

“The customer has to make the decision,” she said. “If they want to keep the risk, they can. I just tell them what I’m hearing, what I’m seeing, and what the various options are.”

A recent national survey of US corporations showed that companies engaged in currency hedging saved anywhere from 10 percent to 15 percent a year on their bottom line.

That’s pretty much in line with what John Matouk & Co. saves from hedging, an estimated 17 percent last year, according to Brust. The company projects and budgets its euro purchases quarterly, rather than tying their purchases to specific vendor invoices, he said.

“So, if we were going to buy €10,000 and our budgeted rate is $1.15 [per euro], we might get a forward contract from Rockland Trust for $1.10 and lock in that rate at better margins than we expected,’’ said Brust. “So the rate might go to $1.20 or it might go to $1.05, but all we care is how we bid against our budgeted rate.”

Currency fluctuations can affect businesses in many ways. Even if a US company doesn’t compete on the international market, it can still be subject to a risk because the price of its foreign competitor’s products may be affected by a change in the exchange rate. In order to effectively compete, the US company might have to lower prices.

“Volatility has been so great lately, there are companies out there that could be doing very well, or very poorly, depending on whether they are importing or exporting, even if they are not hedging,” said McKenna. “But with these huge swings, they might sleep easier by hedging.”"
352,9,"‘People thought it was Banksy’: Comedian Nathan Fielder reveals the REAL story behind his Dumb Starbucks prank
• None Footage revealing the truth behind the prank to be broadcast July 29
• None Revealed to be part of comedian's Nathan For You TV show



It was a caffeine-charged Hollywood whodunit that thousands of people fell for – generating international news coverage.

Now the comedian behind the prank Dumb Starbucks shop in Los Angeles has revealed the real reason he set up the fake store.

Nathan Fielder – star of Comedy Central show Nathan For You – has confessed it was widely believed that there was a political message behind the stunt, which saw free drinks served from the corner of an otherwise uncelebrated strip mall.

He also said people thought the pretend store, which took the name of the coffee giant, was the work of anonymous artist Banksy. Nathan said: ‘That was great - he's one of the greatest artists, and he's so cool. He's famous and I'm doing something that's stupid. So it's great - I'll take that; that's cool.’
• Gisele earns an eye-watering $128,000 a DAY and has a higher... What the thousands of customers lining up to buy ‘horrible’ and ‘bitter’ coffee didn’t know about the shop, which was registered as an art gallery to get round copyright laws, is that they were part of the bigger picture. And all will be revealed on the new series of his TV show, set to air on July 29. Nathan added: ‘Probably what a lot of people don't know is that it was done for an episode of Nathan For You.’

Nathan kept the crowds guessing for several days before revealing he was behind the Dumb Starbucks coffee shop in February.

Keeping a straight face, Canadian comic Fielder told a crowd he was pursuing the ‘American dream’.

Soon after, Los Angeles County health inspectors shut it down for operating without a valid permit.

For much of the weekend, a line from the store wound alongside the parking lot and up the block. 



Some patrons snapped pictures in front of a green awning and mermaid logo that is familiar - except that the word ‘Dumb’ was prominently featured.

They weren't coming for gourmet fare: Their descriptions of the coffee ranged from ‘horrible’ to ‘bitter’, and one parent said his daughter complained that the hot chocolate was like water.

Instead, they were just coming to say they came, and to score a white paper cup with a sticker bearing the curious logo. 



‘It was a pretty dumb idea to come out in the cold and wait for nearly two hours to get a coffee,' joked Anthony Solis, who lives in nearby Hollywood.

Before the rush, production crews came to the location several times to film, according to permits taken out with Film LA, a private non-profit that issues the licenses. 



The permits were billed to Abso Lutely Productions, which has produced Fielder's show.

Once opened, Dumb Starbucks caught the attention of the real Starbucks.

‘While we appreciate the humor, they cannot use our name, which is a protected trademark,’ Laurel Harper, a spokeswoman for Seattle-based Starbucks Corp., said in an email.

She added that most trademark disputes are handled informally, suggesting the company might not need to take legal action.

At the front counter, a sheet of frequently asked questions said the store was shielded by ‘parody law’.

‘By adding the word 'dumb,' we are technically “making fun” of Starbucks, which allows us to use their trademarks under a law known as “fair use”,’ the sheet said.

It continued: ‘In the eyes of the law, our “coffee shop” is actually an art gallery and the “coffee” you're buying is considered art. But that's for our lawyers to worry about.’

One law professor suggested Dumb Starbucks needed to sharpen its legal theory.

‘Fair use’ can protect parodies of copyright material, but a trademark such as the logo has different protections that Dumb Starbucks may well be violating, said Mark McKenna, a trademark law expert at the University of Notre Dame.

Fielder, the comedian, said that he didn't need Starbucks' permission and he was glad the company had not pursued a ‘case they know they can't win’.

He then revealed that city health inspectors had arrived and told his staff that they had to stop serving drinks."

354,9,"The United States and Mexico met this week to address the shared challenges of irregular migration, to include the entry of migrants into the United States in violation of U.S. law. Given the dramatic increase in migrants moving from Central America through Mexico to the United States, both countries recognize the vital importance of rapidly resolving the humanitarian emergency and security situation. The Governments of the United States and Mexico will work together to immediately implement a durable solution.

As a result of these discussions, the United States and Mexico commit to:

Mexico will take unprecedented steps to increase enforcement to curb irregular migration, to include the deployment of its National Guard throughout Mexico, giving priority to its southern border. Mexico is also taking decisive action to dismantle human smuggling and trafficking organizations as well as their illicit financial and transportation networks. Additionally, the United States and Mexico commit to strengthen bilateral cooperation, including information sharing and coordinated actions to better protect and secure our common border.

The United States will immediately expand the implementation of the existing Migrant Protection Protocols across its entire Southern Border. This means that those crossing the U.S. Southern Border to seek asylum will be rapidly returned to Mexico where they may await the adjudication of their asylum claims.

In response, Mexico will authorize the entrance of all of those individuals for humanitarian reasons, in compliance with its international obligations, while they await the adjudication of their asylum claims. Mexico will also offer jobs, healthcare and education according to its principles.

The United States commits to work to accelerate the adjudication of asylum claims and to conclude removal proceedings as expeditiously as possible.

Both parties also agree that, in the event the measures adopted do not have the expected results, they will take further actions. Therefore, the United States and Mexico will continue their discussions on the terms of additional understandings to address irregular migrant flows and asylum issues, to be completed and announced within 90 days, if necessary.

The United States and Mexico reiterate their previous statement of December 18, 2018, that both countries recognize the strong links between promoting development and economic growth in southern Mexico and the success of promoting prosperity, good governance and security in Central America. The United States and Mexico welcome the Comprehensive Development Plan launched by the Government of Mexico in concert with the Governments of El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras to promote these goals. The United States and Mexico will lead in working with regional and international partners to build a more prosperous and secure Central America to address the underlying causes of migration, so that citizens of the region can build better lives for themselves and their families at home."
355,9,"In the world of modern business, where you are is just as important as what you do. The right location plays a big part in attracting qualified talent, allowing more collaboration, and presenting a relatable, physical association for customers and clients. Today, real estate is not necessarily seen as a source of competitive advantage – but it very much is. It's actually a tool that can drive business.

Skilled real estate management is a discipline; lack of experience can have serious consequences. Both new and established companies are susceptible to bad real estate decisions without realizing the implications they can have on the business — or the value a good real estate move can offer. Here's how one company has used real estate as a successful business strategy.

Young & Rubicam is one of the most recognized and respected ad agencies in the world. But a few years ago Y&R was going through changes. For more than 86 years, the agency’s global headquarters were at 285 Madison Avenue in New York City, and the space was synonymous with the agency itself. However, as Y&R continued to expand, its space on Madison avenue no longer provided the amenities it needed. Finding the right space was critical for Y&R; not only did it have to meet its expanding needs, it also had to be a space where the agency's culture, ethos, and creativity could thrive.

Working with CBRE, a commercial real estate services firm, Y&R identified 3 Columbus Circle as the ideal site for its new global headquarters. CBRE helped Y&R secure a hybrid deal to acquire a condominium interest of floors three through eight, and enter into a 20-year lease for floors nine, 10, 18, and 19 at 3 Columbus Circle.

Y&R's new offices allow for creative expression and better collaboration. CBRE One of the many draws of the new building is that it provides a number of features that are appealing to both employees and clients, including a sunlit mix of public and private space. Different pieces of art on the walls match the creativity of the campaigns that come from the agency teams. Recognizing that the office is where many employees spend most of their time, Y&R created a number of break areas: a roof deck where people can enjoy stunning views of Central Park; a cafeteria that offers a number of different dining options; and areas for employees to relax and even play foosball and shuffleboard.

And it's not just the actual building that can influence employees' happiness — the location is also a big draw. The neighborhood has easy subway access, so it's convenient for employees from across the numerous New York City boroughs. Because the office is part of a hub that houses other agencies within WPP (Y&R's holding company), it creates a great space for Y&R to collaborate with colleagues at sister firms.

The space has proven to be a valuable asset for Y&R, helping the firm deliver on its best-in-class creative reputation and serve as a place where both employees and clients want to be. Another reminder that it’s not just about what you do, but where you do it.

356,9,"OLYMPIA, WASH. – On May 7, 2019, Governor Jay Inslee signed into law Senate Bill 5116, which mandates that the state gets 100 percent of its electricity from clean sources by 2045. The passage positions Washington as a national leader in the transition to a clean, affordable, and reliable energy future.

Washington state’s announcement comes at a time when both the reality of the climate crisis and the practical steps to solve it have never been clearer.

Eighteen of the 19 hottest years on record have occurred since the beginning of this century, and alongside these increases in global temperatures, weather events like major hurricanes, floods, and droughts have become more frequent and severe. But with clean energy and energy storage becoming more affordable and widely available, we have the solutions today to solve this crisis.

The Climate Reality Project’s Washington state chapters in Bellingham, Snohomish County, Seattle, Tacoma, and Thurston County, as well as Climate Reality Leaders in other parts of the state, joined forces as the Washington State Coalition, under the guidance of the Environmental Priorities Coalition. The coalition worked to get the state legislature to commit to transition to a safer, more sustainable energy future for the Evergreen State.

Climate Reality Leaders and chapter members were instrumental in the passage of the bill. They assisted in sending 415 emails to state senators in support of the legislation, and hosted more than 10 meetings with representatives from Everett, Mukilteo, Seattle, Bellevue, Redmond and Kirkland, Olympia, and the Snohomish County Public Utilities Department (PUD). Their collective efforts also prompted 10 businesses to sign on in support of the statewide initiative.

“Today was a momentous occasion for all Washingtonians with the passing of SB 5116,” said Ali Lee, co-chair of The Climate Reality Project: Seattle, WA Chapter and the 100% Committed WA state campaign chair. “We rallied chapters and Climate Reality Leaders across the state to make calls, publish articles, and meet with legislators to help pass this bill. Thank you all for this truly statewide effort, working together as Climate Reality Leaders in coalition with other like-minded organizations for 100 percent clean electricity.”

The bill phases out coal from the electricity grid by the end of 2025 and makes swift progress toward cutting further carbon pollution by setting an interim target of carbon-neutral electricity by 2030.

SB 5116 invests in low-income communities to correct historic energy inequities through a cumulative impact analysis in the development of clean energy action plans, and funding made available for energy assistance to low-income households. The bill also invests in Washington workers as part of the transition to clean electricity, prioritizing jobs with livable wages.

The passage of the bill positions Washington state as a national leader in the transition to clean electricity with a dedicated focus on correcting historic climate injustices and lifting up the vulnerable communities often most affected by the climate crisis.

Founded by Nobel Laureate and former US Vice President Al Gore, The Climate Reality Project is working to catalyze a global solution to the climate crisis by making urgent action a necessity across every level of society. With a global movement more than five million strong and a grassroots network of trained Climate Reality Leader activists, we are spreading the truth about the climate crisis and building popular support for clean energy solutions. For more information, visit www.climaterealityproject.org or follow us on Twitter at @ClimateReality.

A Climate Reality chapter is a local group of climate activists in the United States that share The Climate Reality Project’s mission of supporting action to combat the climate crisis so we can make the transition to a clean energy economy and protect the welfare of the planet and its citizens.

Our chapters provide an immediate way for everyday Americans to connect and network with other climate activists, recruit additional volunteers, take action, and become a powerful force for climate solutions in their communities. Learn more at https://www.climaterealityproject.org/chapters."
357,9,"Tina Ware woke up early that morning to the sound of her smoke alarm.

She had no idea how fast the fire would grow. Sparked by a faulty plug in another room, flames spread quickly, filling the house with smoke. “It was so thick,” she says. “We were coughing — you couldn’t breathe.” It was clear she had to get the kids to safety. “It was panic. We didn’t know what to do,” she says. “We had to get out of there.” She and her family escaped into the chilly February air, only to watch their 15-year-old home in Church Hill, Tenn., go up in flames."

359,9,"Hillary Clinton broke out in a vicious coughing fit about two-thirds of the way through a speech she gave in Harlem on Tuesday.

As she struggled to get it under control, first with water and then eventually a cough drop, Clinton riffed, “Too much to say,” as the crowded auditorium at the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture cheered her on.

Clinton, speaking to an incredibly supportive audience in her home state, suggested that Republican opposition to President Obama’s plan to appoint a Supreme Court justice to take the late Antonin Scalia’s seat is predicated on the inherent racism that has made Obama the enemy for the past seven years of his administration.

“Justice Scalia’s passing means the court hangs in the balance,” Clinton said. “Now the Republicans say they’ll reject anyone President Obama nominates, no matter how qualified. Some are even saying he doesn’t have the right to nominate anyone! As if somehow he’s not the real president.

“That’s in keeping with what we’ve heard all along, isn’t it? Many Republicans talk in coded, racial language about takers and losers. They demonize President Obama and encourage the ugliest impulses of the paranoid fringe. This kind of hatred and bigotry has no place in our politics or our country.”

Republicans in the Senate, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, have said they do not want Obama to appoint a new justice in the last year of his term and would rather wait for the next president to do so.

""The American people‎ should have a voice in the selection of their next Supreme Court justice. Therefore, this vacancy should not be filled until we have a new President,"" McConell said on Saturday, the day Scalia died.

Republican resistance, of course, stems from the fear that Obama will appoint a liberal justice to replace the conservative stalwart that was Scalia. As for whether that fear is also predicated on racial bias remains to be seen.

When asked by The Daily Beast about Clinton’s comment, Attorney General Eric Holder, who was in attendance at her Harlem speech, hesitated to blame Republican opposition on bigotry alone.

“Well, I think there’s a concern that President Obama will select somebody who...shares his worldview,” said Holder, who laughed at the suggestion that he could be picked for the court. “A progressive who is going to vote in certain ways. He is the elected president of the United States, and there’s a constitutional responsibility to appoint justices to the Supreme Court as vacancies occur. I see no compelling argument that is made to the contrary.”

As for Bernie Sanders’s record on legislation benefiting the African-American community, Holder called the senator’s vote against the 1994 Brady Bill an “appalling lack of judgment” and said Clinton clearly has a better record on issues that matter to black voters.

Clinton had quite a bit to say Tuesday about her primary opponent and the Johnny-come-lately persona Clinton’s African-American surrogates have cultivated for him.

“You know, you can’t just show up at election time and say the right things and think that’s enough,” she said. “We can’t start building relationships a few weeks before a vote.”

That line directly echoed what South Carolina House Minority Leader Todd Rutherford had to say about Sanders last week, suggesting he had only come around to issues relevant to the African-American populace in the last “40 days,” while Clinton had been focused on them for the last “40 years.”

Clinton’s speech, which addressed a multitude of specific issues, including the sentencing discrepancies between those in possession of cocaine and crack, and a plan to invest $2 billion in school districts to reform discipline practices, comes at a crucial time in her campaign. After barely eking out a win in Iowa and losing badly in the New Hampshire primary, the former secretary of state is hoping to rebound with a strong showing in Nevada and South Carolina, the latter of which she is expected to win big.

But as the speech, with all its references to Flint and jabs at Sanders, indicates, Clinton is going to have to rely on African-American voters to capitalize on the next contests. She currently holds a 65-28 lead among black voters in South Carolina, according to a poll released by CNN on Tuesday.

Prior to Tuesday’s speech, Clinton met with Rev. Al Sharpton and members of the National Urban League. Still, by day’s end, she had not earned the endorsement of Sharpton, who met with Sanders before Clinton.

“I have not decided who I will support for president, but I’m committed to making sure that our agenda remains front and center,” Sharpton told reporters on Tuesday.

It’s unclear whether his support would boost Clinton, who has more immediate name recognition in the African-American community than Sanders does. But as the support of black voters becomes crucial to both Democratic candidates, Clinton seems to be more confident, repeating a new line added to her stump speech about not being a “single issue candidate.”

“We have to begin by facing up to the reality of systemic racism, because these are not only problems of economic inequality,” Clinton said, referring to Sanders’s most repeated line."
361,9,"Who’s the first person that comes to mind when you think about someone who uses advanced math and science every day? A doctor? A chemist? Certainly someone in a white lab coat. Perhaps an engineer performing calculations on a computer or working on complex machines?

Sure, these professions are the most closely associated with the science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) fields, but what about plumbers and pipefitters? Trigonometry is central to their work. And other workers in the trades, such as technicians who operate plants and refineries, need to keep the principles of chemistry and physics in their heads whenever they’re on the job.

With the expansion of advanced technologies and processes into more and more fields, the science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) economy is much bigger than many imagine and the barriers to entry are also lower than most think. Occupations like pipefitting and welding require only a high school diploma plus technical training to start. In fact, high school and community college graduates, along with those who don’t have a four-year university diploma, hold half of these positions.

These are well-paying jobs: Work that demands technical know-how, but not a master’s or Ph.D., and pays better than the national average wage of $46,000. American plumbers and pipefitters, for instance, earned more than $49,000 in 2012, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Expanding out to other fields, a recent Brookings report found U.S. STEM workers who haven’t attained a bachelor’s degree earn an average salary of $53,000, about 10 percent higher than non-STEM employees with the same educational background.

For those looking to get into work that requires STEM skills, the Bureau of Labor Statistics is bullish about demand by employers, concluding that “STEM occupations are...viewed as having some of the best opportunities for job growth in the future.” Indeed, the Commerce Department projects that the number of STEM jobs will have grown by 17 percent from 2008 to 2018.

Taken together, the projected demand for more technical workers across all industries and the higher wages for all levels of educational achievement point to a revitalized, robust middle class as an achievable goal. It also means that science and technology are no longer walled off in labs and universities; they're on the job and in our daily lives. That’s why many community colleges and vocational schools across the country are ramping up their training programs in STEM fields. They see the national projections and hear from local employers who need skilled workers.

At Mississippi Gulf Coast Community College (MGCCC), that need for employees has pushed the administration to build new facilities to teach STEM skills. In the near future, the school will have 35,000 square feet of labs and other space dedicated solely to training welders, machinists and instrumentation control technicians, among other tech-driven occupations. Carmen Walters, the vice president of one of MGCCC’s campuses, points to studies that show there will be some 46,000 available STEM jobs in the state by 2018. “We feel confident that STEM jobs are growing in Mississippi,” she says. “Engineering and support jobs are well paid, and we want to train our students to get them.”

The hundreds who matriculate every year with a combination of hands-on training and coursework will find jobs at the nearby power plant, chemical factory, shipyard or refinery. Travis Brooks, one such recent graduate of MGCCC’s Process Operations Technology course, said he enrolled because he wanted a career that allowed for growth and for him to work with his hands. He chose the Process Operations Technology track, which was created in partnership with Chevron, because completing it better positioned him for a job at the company’s oil refinery in nearby Pascagoula."
362,9,"Throughout history, the medical world has constantly searched for new ways to numb pain. In the late 19th century, cocaine was discovered in medicine and first used as a form of local anesthetic.This new drug allowed doctors to perform surgeries that had never been tried before. Physicians soon saw that with the benefits came a long list of side effects including addiction. What was once an open market for cocaine and cocaine-infused products came to an end in 1914 as the federal government stopped the unregulated sale of the drug. The need to find innovative ways to dull pain continues today. In 1996, California allowed medical marijuana to be prescribed by doctors, opening up the opportunity for this controlled substance to bring relief to patients. Since then, 22 states have followed. On January 1, 2016, New York will become the next state to allow the sale of medical marijuana."

365,9,"This is the first article in a four-part special advertising feature series presented by Mazda that looks at the ongoing relationship between technology, innovation and sport.

Technical innovation in sport - it's something we as participants and fans take for granted now. It could be Grand Prix champion Lewis Hamilton talking to his pit crew throughout his thrilling drive in Austin Texas to win the 2015 Formula One title. Or improvements in the safety standards of cricketers' helmets, following the death of Australian Test batsman Phillip Hughes when a delivery struck him at the top of his neck, in Sydney in 2014.

Perhaps the most interesting development is the introduction of ingestible computers that constantly transmit data on a player's vital functions, such as blood pressure and body temperature. Athletes in sports as diverse as motor sport, athletics, football and hockey are already using them. It's the latest innovation in the ever-changing world of sports technology.

Move Like Never Before If you look at the many incredible achievements of the modern world, chances are you'll find it's a result of a potent combination of innovation and technology. This combination lets us live and move like never before. Mazda's innovation and technology has allowed them to develop the Mazda CX-3.

Let's turn the clock back more than 70 years, when one of sport's greatest innovations evolved from a bitter feud between two brothers. Adi and Rudi Dassler were partners in a sports shoe company in Herzogenaurach, Germany. After an acrimonious split , the brothers formed rival companies - Adidas and Puma - on opposite sides of the river Aurach.

The schism inspired a battle for domination in athletic footwear - firstly in newly formed West Germany, and then the rest of the world. It led to a race to find styles and materials that gave top athletes the slightest advantage. Manufacturers are still in a fight for domination, with the global market tipped to be worth US$84.4 billion in 2018. Amazingly, Adidas and Puma are still up there fighting for their share of the lucrative sports shoe market, along with Nike, Reebok and other companies.

The only objective is to win - to be bigger, stronger, faster … smarter.

Athletes, teams and sports organisations will always seek to find an edge over their rivals (or the stopwatch). It might be the chance to gain a physical advantage through better training techniques, or a mental edge through superior tactics. Or it might be through playing with equipment that allows them to go faster, with more comfort and safety, for longer. At the 2015 Tour de France, for example, cyclists carried miniature GPS-equipped computers that tracked speed, distance travelled and calories burned.

Technology continues to be crucial factor in any individual or team success, especially at the elite level. And as every player or team finds an advantage, opponents try to counter it. This sports innovation cycle has made billionaires of entrepreneurs in the sports equipment industry, and created jobs for sports scientists and psychologists who deliver stunning results for athletes, teams and sponsors.

The push for sporting innovation has also given spectators the chance to be more involved in the action. Using miniature, high-speed and even infrared cameras and ultra-sensitive microphones, broadcasters and sports organisations bring fans closer to the action. Intimacy equals greater ratings and sponsorship money.

When Tennis legend John McEnroe screamed 'You Cannot Be Serious' at the Umpire while contesting a decision, it added to the excitement for the Wimbledon crowd. With the introduction of Hawk-Eye in Grand Slams in 2006, we may have lost some of the human drama, but we've gained a near-faultless ball-tracking technology that enjoys the support of most players and officials. Many sporting organisations, including the NFL in the US, and the Rugby Union authorities at the recent World Cup in England, use ""slo-mo"" video technology as part of their on-field decision-making, while their officials use it to determine if players should be suspended for foul play.

Technology has also had a fundamental impact on the way players train. Cutting-edge training facilities are a home away from home for elite athletes, who rely on sophisticated machines and monitors to reach peak performance while averting the risk of injury. Sports scientists use technology to develop training regimes that allow individual athletes to perform at their best.

Modern technology also allows sports to find future stars, with talented teenagers tested to determine which disciplines best suit their physiology. These days, star rowers are discovered before they even step onto a boat. But some sports testing is less about finding champions and more about exposing cheats. World anti-drug agencies strive - with varying degrees of success - to develop sophisticated tests to uncover athletes and coaches who are seeking an unfair chemical advantage.

Technology has also revolutionised sports psychology. What gives players confidence, awareness, courage? How do players stop being complacent, fearful, nervous? Psychologists have learnt the answer is different for every athlete. Visualisation techniques, where players ""see"" a successful outcome before it happens, are practised by athletes at all levels.

Managers and coaches increasingly use technology to help with tactics, in real time. In cricket, ball-tracking software helps bowlers find weaknesses in batting techniques. And in Australian Rules Football, live statistics help coaches find players who are getting beaten by their opponents.

Motor sport is an industry almost entirely based on technology. Grand Prix racing takes this to the furthest reaches, with competitors looking for any edge that will bring them faster lap times measurable to one-thousandth of a second. Engine and chassis information is available in real time for drivers, team managers and pit crews. This information is available to fans watching on television or on their computers or mobile devices.

Consumers are the ultimate winners when innovations trickle down from elite competition. Motor sport has improved the efficiency and safety of road cars, and continues to be a test bed for technology. In the same way that disc brakes, advanced four-wheel drive systems and turbochargers were developed in the motor-sport crucible decades ago, the world's smartest engineers are refining hybrid engine technology, synthetic oils and fuels to improve the cars we will drive in the future.

This principle applies in all sports. The same state-of-the-art composite racquet Novak Djokovic used to win Wimbledon will win the mixed doubles final at the local tennis club. Golf equipment manufacturers, forced to abide by a strict set of global rules for elite and amateur players, endeavour to design clubs that help hackers hit the ball straighter and longer.

What of the future? Some say we're entering the age of 'smart wearables' technology, with athletes competing in outfits that transmit performance data in real time. Others believe that nanotechnology will transform the way everyday sporting equipment is made, making it stronger, lighter and easier to use. Hopefully, we will continue to be the beneficiaries of these advances, both as amateur competitors whose clothing and equipment are constantly improving, and as armchair fans whose enjoyment of sport is given a boost by the latest revolutionary technological advance."
366,9,"Swipe right if you’re excited about the state of online education.

You should be, because it seems the technology is finally catching up with the promise of delivering a bonafide college degree entirely online.

Make no mistake, though: The path to your degree may be more convenient, but the work is just as rigorous. At the CUNY School of Professional Studies – which is ranked #3 in New York State and #27 in the nation in US News & World Report’s 2015 Best Online Bachelor’s Degree Programs list – there is no difference in workload or pedigree when it comes to earning a degree online or off.

And for all the obvious benefits like accessibility and affordability, dig deeper and you’ll find a trove of hidden benefits, too. Here are six to keep in mind when deciding if an online education is right for you.

Don’t Pause Your Career to Advance It

Recent census data showed that 71% of undergraduates in the U.S. were working during school. And the value of a degree is undisputed: those with a bachelor’s degree earn approximately $57,026 per year, compared to the $34,197 for those with only a high school diploma. Online school lets students get the degree they need to advance their career without having to miss work to get there.

The average college student buys 6 textbooks per semester. One tree can yield enough paper to make roughly 35 textbooks. With online students using less hard copy text books and less paper in class, that amounts to a whole lot of salvaged trees each year.

Study on Your Own Terms

Studies show that having more control over the pace and environment of your learning can have very positive effects. For example, your ability to retain information diminishes after 25-30 minutes. And something as simple as changing scenery improves retention when studying. So the freedom to study when and where you want isn’t just convenient – it’s a grade booster.

In New York City, the average commute time is 37.8 minutes. That means that during a 32-week school year, a student could spend 200 hours (or 8.4 days) commuting to and from school – time that could be better spent with family and friends.

Though the freshman “15” may overstate the issue, a recent study of college freshmen tracked an average gain of approximately 0.3 pounds per week – 11 times more than the typical weekly weight gain in 17- and 18-year-olds and 20 times more than the typical American adult. The culprits: stress from change of environment, all-you-can-eat cafeteria buffets, and lack of sleep – all things you won’t have to worry about in your home environment.

Daily consumer spending, or “walking around money” spent, is near all-time highs at over $90 per day. That includes stores, restaurants, gas stations, and other living expenses. In other words: Having to trek around town is expensive. Being able to attend class from wherever you want? Much more economical.

The CUNY School of Professional Studies offers 10 bachelor’s degrees, 8 master’s degrees, certificate, and advanced certificate programs. To learn more about CUNY’s highly rated online degree programs, visit sps.cuny.edu"
367,9,"The rate at which new cases of breast cancer are being diagnosed in Sussex County is stable, while the county's breast-cancer death rate is falling, according to the National Cancer Institute (NCI) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

As National Breast Cancer Awareness Month is observed in the area and across the country, the oncologists of Regional Cancer Care Associates, or RCCA, in Sparta want to provide area residents with background on those encouraging trends and important information on protecting and promoting breast health.

The NCI and CDC report that an average 121 county residents were diagnosed with breast cancer each year from 2008 to 2012, the last period for which data are available.1 The annual rate at which new cases were diagnosed held steady during that period, at roughly 132 people per 100,000. 1 Meanwhile, the rate of death from breast cancer in Sussex County fell by approximately 1.9 percent each year during that period, to 24.2 per 100,000 people, according to the NCI and CDC.2 This translates into 22 women dying of breast cancer each year, on average, from 2008 through 2012. 2 Both the stable rate of new cases and falling death rate are in line with statewide and national trends.

Dr. May Abdo-Matkiwsky, Dr. Bohdan Halibey and Dr. Jumana Chatiwala note that while these trends are welcome, and that the declining death rate reflects the significant progress that has been made in treating breast cancer in recent years, there is still a long way to go in terms of prevention, early diagnosis, and therapy. One of the first steps in that process, they add, is for women to be aware of factors that may increase or reduce breast cancer risk, and to work to change those factors that can be modified.

According to the American Cancer Society (ACS), lifestyle or behavioral factors that affect a woman's risk of breast cancer include: 3

Meanwhile, RCCA oncologists note, women also should be aware of the other factors that can increase their risk for breast cancer but that are beyond their control. According to the ACS, these non-modifiable risk factors include: 3

The oncologists of RCCA emphasize that in addition to working to change those risk factors that can be modified, women can protect their breast health and overall well-being by seeing their health care provider regularly for preventive care and having mammograms in keeping with the guidelines applicable to their age and medical history.

With offices at 89 Sparta Ave., Suite 130, in Sparta (973-726-0005), the local oncologists of RCCA are part of one of the nation's largest oncology-physician networks, working with more than 100 oncologist colleagues at 25 locations throughout the state to provide patients with cutting-edge, compassionate care at convenient, nearby locations and increased access to more than 300 clinical trials.

369,9,"The United States and Mexico met this week to address the shared challenges of irregular migration, to include the entry of migrants into the United States in violation of U.S. law. Given the dramatic increase in migrants moving from Central America through Mexico to the United States, both countries recognize the vital importance of rapidly resolving the humanitarian emergency and security situation. The Governments of the United States and Mexico will work together to immediately implement a durable solution.

As a result of these discussions, the United States and Mexico commit to:

Mexico will take unprecedented steps to increase enforcement to curb irregular migration, to include the deployment of its National Guard throughout Mexico, giving priority to its southern border. Mexico is also taking decisive action to dismantle human smuggling and trafficking organizations as well as their illicit financial and transportation networks. Additionally, the United States and Mexico commit to strengthen bilateral cooperation, including information sharing and coordinated actions to better protect and secure our common border.

The United States will immediately expand the implementation of the existing Migrant Protection Protocols across its entire Southern Border. This means that those crossing the U.S. Southern Border to seek asylum will be rapidly returned to Mexico where they may await the adjudication of their asylum claims.

In response, Mexico will authorize the entrance of all of those individuals for humanitarian reasons, in compliance with its international obligations, while they await the adjudication of their asylum claims. Mexico will also offer jobs, healthcare and education according to its principles.

The United States commits to work to accelerate the adjudication of asylum claims and to conclude removal proceedings as expeditiously as possible.

Both parties also agree that, in the event the measures adopted do not have the expected results, they will take further actions. Therefore, the United States and Mexico will continue their discussions on the terms of additional understandings to address irregular migrant flows and asylum issues, to be completed and announced within 90 days, if necessary.

The United States and Mexico reiterate their previous statement of December 18, 2018, that both countries recognize the strong links between promoting development and economic growth in southern Mexico and the success of promoting prosperity, good governance and security in Central America. The United States and Mexico welcome the Comprehensive Development Plan launched by the Government of Mexico in concert with the Governments of El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras to promote these goals. The United States and Mexico will lead in working with regional and international partners to build a more prosperous and secure Central America to address the underlying causes of migration, so that citizens of the region can build better lives for themselves and their families at home."

""I continue to believe Mr. Trump will not be president,"" Obama said while speaking at a press conference in Rancho Mirage, California. ""And the reason is because I have a lot of faith in the American people.""

Obama told reporters he believed Americans still see the presidency as ""a serious job.""

“It’s not hosting a talk show, or a reality show. It’s not promotion, it’s not marketing,” Obama said. “It’s hard and a lot of people count on us getting it right.”

Obama did not, however, answer whether he believed Trump was capable of securing the GOP nomination.

The president also took a shot at the rest of the GOP field, saying “foreign observers are troubled” by the GOP's rhetoric, specifically the doubting of climate change and proposals to ban Muslims from entering the U.S.

Trump, speaking at a campaign event in South Carolina, immediately hit back, saying Obama is doing a ""lousy job.""

372,9,"The reason so many of us declare confidently—standing tall at the ripe old ages of 10,11,12—that we want to be astronauts when we grow up is the magical pull of an idea that reaches deep, an exhilarating challenge to the furthest limits of curiosity. For most people imagination is as far as it goes, and for those who actually pursue the ambition to become an astronaut, the barrier to entry is extremely high. NASA selects only a tiny fraction of applicants. In 2013, more than 6,000 people applied. NASA picked eight. Of those who make it all the way through astronaut training, even fewer have the opportunity to visit the International Space Station—an orbiting laboratory a bit larger than a six-bedroom house that contains one of the world’s best examples of international cooperation in the pursuit of knowledge. It’s up there right now, orbiting the earth once every 90 minutes, 220 miles up. NASA will help you find where it is at any given moment right here. What follows is for those of us who will never get to make the trip: a chance to see what it’s like up close.

When astronaut candidates begin training, one of the first things they have to master, oddly enough, is swimming. In addition to becoming scuba-certified, they have to swim three lengths of a 25-meter pool without stopping. Then they have to do it again in a flight suit and tennis shoes. This prepares them for spacewalks, also known as Extra-Vehicular Activities (EVAs), which refer to any work that’s done outside a spacecraft. Astronaut candidates also undergo extensive training in hypobaric and hyperbaric environments, and with periods of simulated weightlessness. Missions to the ISS can require an additional two or three years of training after the initial astronaut candidate period. At the Sonny Carter Training Facility, also known as the Neutral Buoyancy Laboratory, a 6.2-million gallon water tank is used to simulate weightlessness, and a model of the International Space Station, fully submerged, allows them to practice everything they’ll be doing at the ISS, from such daily activities as preparing food to spacewalks.

Up until March of this year, typical missions to the ISS have lasted between three and six months. But now, American astronaut Scott Kelly and Russian cosmonaut Mikhail Kornienko are almost halfway through the first ever one-year mission to the ISS. More explicitly than any previous mission, the goal of the one-year experience is to see how the two men's bodies and minds react to such an extended period in space. This will help NASA determine how far humans are from being able to handle–physically and psychologically–a trip to Mars, which could take several years. To get a sense of what that would be like, here’s a look at Kelly and Kornienko’s home:

Most people think it’s zero gravity that causes astronauts to float, but on the ISS that’s actually not the case. In fact, the station is subject to 90 percent of the gravity that’s found on the earth. Astronauts float on the ISS and outside on spacewalks because they are in a state of free-fall. They miss the earth because the speed at which they are traveling–17,500 mph–is enough to counteract the force of gravity that would otherwise pull them down, so they just keep falling, as if they’re always on the downhill side of a roller coaster. Even though they understand all this, they say, the feeling of weightlessness never gets old.

A little push with your big toe will take you halfway across the station. It’s like being Superman—with just the brush of a finger. It does not get old, even after 381 days.”

You sweat buckets up there. On the ground, when you’re riding the bike, the sweat drips off you. Up there, the sweat sticks to you—you have pools of sweat on your arms, your head, around your eyes. Once in a while, a glob of it will go flying off.”

In many elements of the ISS astronaut experience, there are attempts to approximate the creature comforts of life on earth. But, obviously, it’s never quite the same, and sleep might be the quintessential example of that. When it’s time to turn in for the night, astronauts don comfy pajamas, open the doors to their sleep pods, and zip themselves into a sleeping-bag-like enclosure. In space, though, they never actually lie down, knowing that when the lights go out and the doors close, they’ll just float in their sleeping bags, unaware of which way is up.

A lot of people think astronauts’ food is nothing like what we eat on earth–that it’s all unrecognizable and, well, gross. But while almost everything they eat is either freeze-dried, thermostabilized (i.e. canned but not stored in metal), or powdered, requiring rehydration—and while some foods are off the table entirely because they don’t conform to NASA’s requirements—meals aren’t as limited or unappetizing as we think, and the menu isn’t completely out of astronauts’ hands. There are more than 200 items on the “core menu” that NASA offers, about 110 of which have been developed from scratch by the food lab scientists. Before traveling to the ISS, astronauts meet with NASA’s food lab to try out their options and make some selections for what they want to eat (each gets to pick nine for every six-month stint on the ISS). One of the astronauts’ favorites is freeze-dried shrimp cocktail with a spicy cocktail sauce, both of which have to be rehydrated. Every once in a while, though, the astronauts get a shipment of fresh fruits, and even non-freeze-dried ice cream. And when that happens, it’s a party!

It's kind of like going over Niagara Falls in a barrel, but the barrel is on fire.”

I’ve been telling people it’s like getting on the Tilt-a-Whirl, you know, that amusement ride — sitting on that for a couple of months and then getting off.”

And they are never the same, perhaps most of all because they have a new perspective on home, having seen Planet Earth from afar. As ISS astronaut Nicole Stott puts it: “I don't know how you can come back and not, in some way, be changed. It may be subtle. You see a difference in different people in their general response when they come back from space. But I think, collectively, everybody has that emblazoned on their memories, the way the planet looks. You can't take that lightly."""
373,9,"From poutine and meat pies to maple syrup-covered meals in sugar shacks, Québec City’s rich cuisine is rooted in tradition. Named one of the Top 20 Best Food Cities in the World according to readers of Condé Nast Traveler, it owes much of its hearty flavor to a storied history as well as a booming contemporary food scene—making it an ideal destination for classic French dishes and modern twists alike.

Take a bite out of the city’s culinary roots



Traditional Québec City cuisine found its foothold during the fur trade period, shortly after French settlers came to Canada. Dishes featured both French-inspired tastes as well as lard or other fatty ingredients that kept traders warm and satisfied in the cold Canadian winter. One of the most popular dishes of the 1600s was tourtière, a spiced meat pie with a flaky crust. Traditionally made with game birds, it’s now more commonly served with fowl or pork during Christmas and New Year’s celebrations. For a taste year-round, make a reservation at the revered Restaurant Aux Anciens Canadiens and order “Grandma’s treat,” a classic Québec meat pie served with beans and potatoes.

Arguably the region’s most popular dish, poutine (French-fried potatoes covered in gravy and cheesecurds) is rumored to have been first created in a Québec bar in the 1950s. While you’ll be happy with the poutine at just about any restaurant—this is Québec, after all—local fast-food chain Chez Ashton is one of the best-known local choices, lauded for its fresh-cut fries and homemade sauce. For a more contemporary take, head to Le Chic Shack, where you can choose from poutine with sophisticated toppings like wild mushroom ragoût, pickled onions, or horseradish aioli.

Be in for a sweet surprise



 If you’re visiting Québec during the spring thaw, you’re in luck: it’s sugar season! Every March and April, Québecois gather to enjoy a gigantic meal of eggs, beans, ham, bacon, and deep-fried smoked pork jowls—all doused in a healthy serving of just-tapped maple syrup—at a local sugar shack (cabane à sucre). Comparable to the American Thanksgiving, the feast is served at long, family-style tables and often followed by a horse-drawn sleigh ride or tire sur la neige, wherein boiled maple tree sap is poured over clean snow to harden and create a maple taffy treat.

Though French tradition plays a large role in Québec City fare, the city’s contemporary cuisine is also influenced by the area’s varied culture. Locals enjoy dining out in the neighborhood of Saint-Jean, a bustling bohemian neighborhood with a historic past: It’s the home of J.A. Moisan, the oldest grocery store in North America. St-Jean’s recently revitalized neighbor, the Saint-Roch district, is also a trendy destination. Once a working-class neighborhood, its converted factories, artist lofts, and entrepreneurial spirit combine to create a wonderfully urban dining experience. Experience the best of the area’s cuisine with a leisurely brunch at Le Clocher Penché Bistrot, where your meal is served with a latte and verrine, an appetizer served in a small glass.

Hop on to the city’s craft beer trend

Next, enjoy an afternoon or evening at La Korrigane, a microbrewery owned by Catherine Foster, a former geologist. “My father started brewing his own beer in the early 90s, so I saw him brewing since I was a young girl,” says Foster, who opened La Korrigane in 2010. “The restaurant for which he brewed closed in 2008, and I was sad he was not going to continue selling his beer—so I bought his equipment to start my own brewery.”

La Korrigane, one of many breweries in the city, still uses several of Foster’s father’s traditional recipes. “We have more than 25 recipes at the brewery, but we serve about eight to 10 at a time,” says Foster. All of the food at La Korrigane is locally grown and produced—“from the cheese to the beef to the potatoes for French fries,” Foster says. “We use fresh, local blueberries, cranberries, honey, and maple syrup in our beer, too.”

Local produce, fresh for the eating (and picking)



 This seems to be a trend in Québec: Locally grown ingredients are becoming paramount in Québecois cooking. “Many restaurants in Québec City offer local, seasonal vegetables with their main dishes,” says Foster. One such restaurant is Panache Mobile, a food truck stationed at Vignoble de Sainte-Pétronille vineyard on Île d’Orleans. The truck is a spinoff of Panache, a four-diamond restaurant led by Louis Pacquelin, a respected local chef. The menu is adapted to whatever local produce is in season, so you can bet on fresh flavors year-round—though the lobster roll is a good choice any time of year.

If foraging for your own food is more your style, drive a few miles outside the city to a “U-pick” farm. Much like New England orchards, U-pick farms allow visitors to harvest their own fruits and vegetables for a farm-to-table experience. Pick apples, raspberries, black currants, and even asparagus at farms as nearby as Île d’Orléans, just a short drive from the city center. Enjoy the fruits of your labor on the spot, or head back to the city and pair them with gourmet cheeses and freshly-baked baguettes from a local bakery. Either way, you’ll finish your “tour de Québec City cuisine” as the locals do."

That is, in a word, overkill. It’s uncalled for.

But we’re not gonna take it anymore. And you shouldn’t, either!

This year, it’s time to take a stand.

Time to kick dieting to the curb, once and for all.

To band together and declare in one unified voice that we will not be influenced to dabble in the unsustainable, sometimes ridiculous fad diets that pop up incessantly everywhere we turn. That we will not be guilted into passing on a piece of birthday cake. That the occasional late-night dessert run is not so bad, and that carbs are most certainly not the enemy.

In 2016, let’s take the time to focus on the more important things in life — the accomplishments that can’t be measured by a scale or waistline. Let’s focus on and recognize your familial and professional accomplishments, and all the other things you do that make the world a better place for you and those around you.

And dietarily speaking, let’s adopt sustainable, achievable nutrition and wellness practices that help us achieve our health goals.

Instead of dieting, let’s band together in pursuit of the innumerable benefits that come with living a healthy lifestyle, and leave dieting guilt and shame by the wayside.

375,9,"Schools that Allow Teachers to Carry Guns are Extremely Safe: Data on the Rate of Shootings and Accidents in Schools that allow Teachers to Carry

After the Columbine school shooting 20 years ago, one of the more significant changes in how we protect students has been the advance of legislation that allows teachers to carry guns at schools. There are two obvious questions: Does letting teachers carry create dangers? Might they deter attackers? Twenty states currently allow teachers and staff to carry guns to varying degrees on school property, so we don’t need to guess how the policy would work. There has yet to be a single case of someone being wounded or killed from a shooting, let alone a mass public shooting, between 6 AM and midnight at a school that lets teachers carry guns. Fears of teachers carrying guns in terms of such problems as students obtaining teachers guns have not occurred at all, and there was only one accidental discharge outside of school hours with no one was really harmed. While there have not been any problems at schools with armed teachers, the number of people killed at other schools has increased significantly – doubling between 2001 and 2008 versus 2009 and 2018.

378,9,"Hillary Clinton broke out in a vicious coughing fit about two-thirds of the way through a speech she gave in Harlem on Tuesday.

As she struggled to get it under control, first with water and then eventually a cough drop, Clinton riffed, “Too much to say,” as the crowded auditorium at the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture cheered her on.

Clinton, speaking to an incredibly supportive audience in her home state, suggested that Republican opposition to President Obama’s plan to appoint a Supreme Court justice to take the late Antonin Scalia’s seat is predicated on the inherent racism that has made Obama the enemy for the past seven years of his administration.

“Justice Scalia’s passing means the court hangs in the balance,” Clinton said. “Now the Republicans say they’ll reject anyone President Obama nominates, no matter how qualified. Some are even saying he doesn’t have the right to nominate anyone! As if somehow he’s not the real president.

“That’s in keeping with what we’ve heard all along, isn’t it? Many Republicans talk in coded, racial language about takers and losers. They demonize President Obama and encourage the ugliest impulses of the paranoid fringe. This kind of hatred and bigotry has no place in our politics or our country.”

Republicans in the Senate, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, have said they do not want Obama to appoint a new justice in the last year of his term and would rather wait for the next president to do so.

""The American people‎ should have a voice in the selection of their next Supreme Court justice. Therefore, this vacancy should not be filled until we have a new President,"" McConell said on Saturday, the day Scalia died.

Republican resistance, of course, stems from the fear that Obama will appoint a liberal justice to replace the conservative stalwart that was Scalia. As for whether that fear is also predicated on racial bias remains to be seen.

When asked by The Daily Beast about Clinton’s comment, Attorney General Eric Holder, who was in attendance at her Harlem speech, hesitated to blame Republican opposition on bigotry alone.

“Well, I think there’s a concern that President Obama will select somebody who...shares his worldview,” said Holder, who laughed at the suggestion that he could be picked for the court. “A progressive who is going to vote in certain ways. He is the elected president of the United States, and there’s a constitutional responsibility to appoint justices to the Supreme Court as vacancies occur. I see no compelling argument that is made to the contrary.”

As for Bernie Sanders’s record on legislation benefiting the African-American community, Holder called the senator’s vote against the 1994 Brady Bill an “appalling lack of judgment” and said Clinton clearly has a better record on issues that matter to black voters.

Clinton had quite a bit to say Tuesday about her primary opponent and the Johnny-come-lately persona Clinton’s African-American surrogates have cultivated for him.

“You know, you can’t just show up at election time and say the right things and think that’s enough,” she said. “We can’t start building relationships a few weeks before a vote.”

That line directly echoed what South Carolina House Minority Leader Todd Rutherford had to say about Sanders last week, suggesting he had only come around to issues relevant to the African-American populace in the last “40 days,” while Clinton had been focused on them for the last “40 years.”

Clinton’s speech, which addressed a multitude of specific issues, including the sentencing discrepancies between those in possession of cocaine and crack, and a plan to invest $2 billion in school districts to reform discipline practices, comes at a crucial time in her campaign. After barely eking out a win in Iowa and losing badly in the New Hampshire primary, the former secretary of state is hoping to rebound with a strong showing in Nevada and South Carolina, the latter of which she is expected to win big.

But as the speech, with all its references to Flint and jabs at Sanders, indicates, Clinton is going to have to rely on African-American voters to capitalize on the next contests. She currently holds a 65-28 lead among black voters in South Carolina, according to a poll released by CNN on Tuesday.

Prior to Tuesday’s speech, Clinton met with Rev. Al Sharpton and members of the National Urban League. Still, by day’s end, she had not earned the endorsement of Sharpton, who met with Sanders before Clinton.

“I have not decided who I will support for president, but I’m committed to making sure that our agenda remains front and center,” Sharpton told reporters on Tuesday.

It’s unclear whether his support would boost Clinton, who has more immediate name recognition in the African-American community than Sanders does. But as the support of black voters becomes crucial to both Democratic candidates, Clinton seems to be more confident, repeating a new line added to her stump speech about not being a “single issue candidate.”

“We have to begin by facing up to the reality of systemic racism, because these are not only problems of economic inequality,” Clinton said, referring to Sanders’s most repeated line."
379,9,"OLYMPIA, WASH. – On May 7, 2019, Governor Jay Inslee signed into law Senate Bill 5116, which mandates that the state gets 100 percent of its electricity from clean sources by 2045. The passage positions Washington as a national leader in the transition to a clean, affordable, and reliable energy future.

Washington state’s announcement comes at a time when both the reality of the climate crisis and the practical steps to solve it have never been clearer.

Eighteen of the 19 hottest years on record have occurred since the beginning of this century, and alongside these increases in global temperatures, weather events like major hurricanes, floods, and droughts have become more frequent and severe. But with clean energy and energy storage becoming more affordable and widely available, we have the solutions today to solve this crisis.

The Climate Reality Project’s Washington state chapters in Bellingham, Snohomish County, Seattle, Tacoma, and Thurston County, as well as Climate Reality Leaders in other parts of the state, joined forces as the Washington State Coalition, under the guidance of the Environmental Priorities Coalition. The coalition worked to get the state legislature to commit to transition to a safer, more sustainable energy future for the Evergreen State.

Climate Reality Leaders and chapter members were instrumental in the passage of the bill. They assisted in sending 415 emails to state senators in support of the legislation, and hosted more than 10 meetings with representatives from Everett, Mukilteo, Seattle, Bellevue, Redmond and Kirkland, Olympia, and the Snohomish County Public Utilities Department (PUD). Their collective efforts also prompted 10 businesses to sign on in support of the statewide initiative.

“Today was a momentous occasion for all Washingtonians with the passing of SB 5116,” said Ali Lee, co-chair of The Climate Reality Project: Seattle, WA Chapter and the 100% Committed WA state campaign chair. “We rallied chapters and Climate Reality Leaders across the state to make calls, publish articles, and meet with legislators to help pass this bill. Thank you all for this truly statewide effort, working together as Climate Reality Leaders in coalition with other like-minded organizations for 100 percent clean electricity.”

The bill phases out coal from the electricity grid by the end of 2025 and makes swift progress toward cutting further carbon pollution by setting an interim target of carbon-neutral electricity by 2030.

SB 5116 invests in low-income communities to correct historic energy inequities through a cumulative impact analysis in the development of clean energy action plans, and funding made available for energy assistance to low-income households. The bill also invests in Washington workers as part of the transition to clean electricity, prioritizing jobs with livable wages.

The passage of the bill positions Washington state as a national leader in the transition to clean electricity with a dedicated focus on correcting historic climate injustices and lifting up the vulnerable communities often most affected by the climate crisis.

Founded by Nobel Laureate and former US Vice President Al Gore, The Climate Reality Project is working to catalyze a global solution to the climate crisis by making urgent action a necessity across every level of society. With a global movement more than five million strong and a grassroots network of trained Climate Reality Leader activists, we are spreading the truth about the climate crisis and building popular support for clean energy solutions. For more information, visit www.climaterealityproject.org or follow us on Twitter at @ClimateReality.

A Climate Reality chapter is a local group of climate activists in the United States that share The Climate Reality Project’s mission of supporting action to combat the climate crisis so we can make the transition to a clean energy economy and protect the welfare of the planet and its citizens.

Our chapters provide an immediate way for everyday Americans to connect and network with other climate activists, recruit additional volunteers, take action, and become a powerful force for climate solutions in their communities. Learn more at https://www.climaterealityproject.org/chapters."

381,9,"Valerie Freeman is accustomed to being the one who cares for and encourages others, but after being diagnosed with triple-negative breast cancer in December 2010, she found herself on the receiving end of both life-saving care and tough-love encouragement from a kindred soul.

""I've come to love Dr. Waintraub because he cares about me as though I were someone in his own family. He never sugar-coats anything. He always keeps it real, but his compassion is awesome. At our first meeting, he said, 'You're going to live through this. You have an aggressive cancer, and we're going to be aggressive in treating it, but you're going to get through this,"" Freeman, 49, says of Stanley Waintraub, MD, FACP, co-chief of breast oncology at the John Theurer Cancer Center at Hackensack University Medical Center and a member of Regional Cancer Care Associates (RCCA).

As a mentor to young women in her hometown of Paterson, Freeman regularly listens to others recount their problems or challenges before offering advice and support that, while sympathetic, is also straightforward. In facing the biggest challenge of her life, she valued her physician taking the same approach. ""At every visit I had with Dr. Waintraub, he always made me feel that I could handle it, that I could get through it,"" she said of her six-month chemotherapy regimen. ""He could be stern, but he was always compassionate. No question was a dumb question. He explained everything - he even drew on a white board to outline things.""

Freeman's battle with cancer began in the summer of 2010, when she noticed a lump in her right breast. At the time, she was busy caring for her mother, who was terminally ill with lung cancer, so she deferred seeking care. At her mother's urging, she eventually had the lump evaluated, and the initial findings were negative. Following her mother's death in October 2010, however, Freeman had follow-up tests that resulted in her receiving a diagnosis of breast cancer on Dec. 29, 2010.

After undergoing lumpectomy at another area hospital, Freeman turned to the John Theurer Cancer Center (JTCC) because she had been very impressed with the way that the RCCA doctors, the nurses, and others there had cared for her mother. Further, she adds that in battling tripe-negative breast cancer, she wanted access to the medical expertise, comprehensive services, and wide-ranging clinical trials offered by JTCC and RCCA, one of the largest oncology physician networks in the United States.

The form of breast cancer that Freeman had is called ""triple negative"" because the cancerous cells do not express genes for estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR) or Her2/neu, targets of the chemotherapies commonly used to treat breast cancer. This lack of receptors that respond to standard chemotherapy regimens makes the cancer particularly difficult to treat, and often requires the use of combinations of chemotherapies. Triple-negative breast cancer, or TNBC, affects African-American women and Hispanic women at a much higher rate than white and Asian women, and during her treatment at JTCC, Freeman entered a clinical trial evaluating new therapeutic approaches to TNBC in African-American women.

While Freeman said that her chemotherapy course was marked by side effects and often grueling, she credits Dr. Waintraub and the nurses, social workers, nutritionists, and others at JTCC with providing care that was as compassionate as it was comprehensive. ""They're amazing,"" she says of the nurses and other team members. ""They didn't make me feel like a patient. They knew me - Val. They knew my likes and dislikes. When I go for follow-up visits, I still get a sick feeling in my stomach when I'm outside the center, because it brings back memories of everything I had to go through, but that goes away the minute I'm inside and seeing all the people who know me and took care of me.""

Today, a little over five years after receiving her diagnosis of TNBC, Freeman remains in remission, and recently moved from a three-month follow-up schedule to a six-month schedule. She is making the most of her good health by enjoying her family and giving back to the community. In addition to mentoring young women, she serves as secretary of Paterson Cares, an organization that feeds the homeless, and is involved in other efforts to enhance the quality of life in Paterson.

She also shares her experience with other women. ""You have to tell your story because you never know who that story will touch,"" she adds. ""I tell people not to view a diagnosis of cancer as a death sentence. That's what you think automatically when you get the news, but it's not necessarily the case any longer. With today's medicine and technology and the different approaches they can use, there is a lot of reason for hope. And while going through treatment can be tough, it's not as bad as you think.""

Dr. Waintraub, who treated Freeman, is a board-certified medical oncologist and hematologist specializing in breast cancer care and research. He received a medical degree from New York Medical College and completed his residency at Metropolitan Hospital Center in New York City before going on to fellowships at Montefiore Medical Center and Memorial Sloan-Kettering Medical Center. He has treated patients in northern New Jersey for more than 30 years.

Dr. Waintraub is one of more than 100 cancer care specialists in RCCA, an oncology physician network dedicated to transforming oncology care by ensuring that cancer patients have access to the highest-quality, most-comprehensive, cutting-edge treatments in a compassionate and community-based setting. RCCA's cancer care specialists are supported by 700 employees at 30 care delivery sites, providing care to more than 23,000 new patients annually and more than 240,000 existing patients.

 ""While we lose muscle mass and our endurance slows as we age, what has always been assumed was part of the normal aging process is made much worse by having a sedentary lifestyle than by merely aging,"" said John Hanrahan, Fitness Center coordinator at Westminster Place, a Presbyterian Homes retirement community in suburban Chicago. ""The saying 'use it or lose it' is absolutely true. We can add muscle to improve strength, increase cardiovascular endurance and improve balance at any age.""

 

 A study published in June by the Oregon State University College of Public Health and Human Sciences showed that 300 minutes a week of light exercise provides significant health benefits for people over age 65. Older adults who engaged in light exercise were 18% healthier overall than their less-active peers. Moreover, light exercise is less likely to cause injuries than moderate to vigorous exercise.

 

 According to OSU professor and study co-author Brad Cardinal, active older adults have lower body mass index, smaller waist circumferences and more balanced insulin levels and are less likely to be afflicted by chronic diseases.

 

 Westminster Place offers many options and opportunities for residents to improve and maintain their fitness. 

 

 ""We have a beautiful fitness center with a well-appointed gym and two pools,"" Hanrahan said. ""We offer group exercise classes for just about everyone. There are land and water classes, seated and standing classes at different times of the day spread throughout our campus.""

 

 Water aerobics, yoga and balance classes are among the more popular offerings, said Hanrahan, who thinks that adults should engage in water aerobics for the energy and group camaraderie, yoga for the physical, mental and perhaps spiritual aspects, and balance classes because balance is something that we all need to work on: ""Even some of us less than 'senior age,' since our balance begins to decline in our 30s."" 

 

 Exercise is part of the new initiative ""Choices: A Program for Living Well"" introduced at Presbyterian Homes and designed to focus on aspects of wellness identified by the International Council on Active Aging. 

 

 The program teaches the multidimensional aspects of healthy living, offering many choices for active older adults based on their interests. The content was based largely on feedback from residents at the five Presbyterian Homes communities in the Greater Chicago area. 

 

 Beyond physical health, the program includes six other wellness dimensions — social, emotional, spiritual, intellectual, community and environmental. The new program is part of a larger campaign by Presbyterian Homes to ensure that residents achieve the highest level of well-being in mind, body and spirit. 

 

 Residents at Westminster Place can also sign up for a national senior fitness test to track personal goals over time. And Hanrahan has designed a fitness boot camp that starts in October for adults seeking a more intense class or heavier workout to achieve their goals. 

 

 ""We'll focus on building strength and endurance by mixing cardio and strength exercises in functional and fun ways,"" Hanrahan said. ""It'll be a new program for us, but I think people will really enjoy it."""
383,9,"The next Supreme Court justice will shape civil and constitutional rights jurisprudence in the country for decades to come. In nominating Brett Kavanaugh, Donald Trump has followed through on his threat to nominate a justice who would undermine basic rights and freedoms.

His record is clear: Brett Kavanaugh poses a direct threat to LGBTQ equality, reproductive rights, affordable healthcare, immigrants’ rights, workers’ rights and so much more.

Need further evidence? Just look at what some of our anti-equality opponents had to say about Trump’s Supreme Court nominee:

Jim Daly, president of the anti-LGBTQ organization Focus on the Family, praised Trump’s choice of Kavanaugh in an interview with the Washington Post, calling him a “top-drawer candidate.” Daly said that “the main reason Christian conservatives voted for President Trump was on the question of judges.”

Anti-LGBTQ Family Research Council President Tony Perkins said that the organization looks forward to having someone with Kavanaugh's “philosophical approach” and that the organization is committed to helping “move the grassroots” to secure the nomination.

Marjorie Dannenfelser, president of the anti-choice Susan B. Anthony List, called Kavanaugh's nomination “another outstanding choice” for Trump. The organization praised Trump for fulfilling his promise in nominating a judge with a record of condemning abortion access.

Carol Tobias, president of the anti-choice NRLC, commended Trump for his nomination of the “exceptionally well qualified” justice to the Supreme Court. “All too often, democratically enacted laws to protect unborn children and other vulnerable humans have been overridden by judges who abuse their power to impose their own policy preferences,” said Tobias.

“This is why conservative women voted overwhelmingly for Donald J. Trump,” said Penny Nance, CEO of the conservative organization. According to Nance, Trump’s nominations of both Gorsuch and Kavanaugh are making good on his promises to affect the Supreme Court for generations.

In proclaiming its support for Trump’s choice, the anti-LGBTQ organization promised to “work hard” to secure Kavanaugh’s nomination against a “brutal” confirmation process.

Brian S. Brown, co-founder of NOM and infamous anti-LGBTQ leader, stated that he was “confident that (Kavanaugh) will join an opinion to overturn gay 'marriage' and restore traditional marriage to our nation's laws.”

Breitbart, a far-right news site associated with white nationalism, called Kavanaugh the “America First” choice. A story published on July 4 proclaimed that Kavanaugh applies “Trump’s economic patriotism” to the law, explaining how their views on immigration and labor align.

The NRA lauded Trump’s nomination as an “outstanding” nominee. “He has an an impressive record that demonstrates his strong support for the Second Amendment,” said Chris W. Cox, NRA executive director. Cox promised that the NRA would activate its millions of members and supporters to ensure Kavanaugh’s confirmation.

The stakes with this nomination could not be higher. We call on the U.S. Senate to fulfill its constitutional duty and reject this dangerous nominee. Text “Save SCOTUS” to 30644 to join HRC in this fight."
384,9,"Washington – Collaboration between the United States and the United Kingdom on financial services was boosted today by the establishment of a Financial Innovation Partnership.

The Partnership between the U.S. Department of the Treasury and the UK’s HM Treasury will build on and deepen bilateral engagement on emerging trends in financial services innovation. This will include encouraging collaboration in the private sector, sharing information and expertise about regulatory practices, and promoting growth and innovation.

“Technology is the future of financial services, and innovation drives growth. By jointly fostering entrepreneurial breakthroughs, we will write a new chapter in the longstanding friendship between America and Britain,” said Heath Tarbert, Acting Under Secretary for International Affairs at the U.S. Department of the Treasury.

“The United Kingdom and United States lead the world in financial services, and are at the cutting edge of innovative fintech. By working more closely together through this new partnership we can help firms in both our countries to go even further to harness new technologies, share expertise and serve consumers,” said John Glen, Economic Secretary to HM Treasury.

“The International Trade Administration is looking forward to participating in this innovative new partnership with the UK that will help drive bilateral financial services collaboration and expand opportunities for firms from both countries at the intersection of financial services, technology and international commerce,” said Gilbert B. Kaplan, Under Secretary for International Trade at the U.S. Department of Commerce.

“The United States is the United Kingdom’s largest bilateral trading partner, so it is brilliant to see this commitment to increase commercial and regulatory cooperation between our leading financial services sectors. Today’s announcement is another positive step toward deepening the already extensive economic ties between the United Kingdom and United States,” said Graham Stuart MP, Minister for Investment.

The Financial Innovation Partnership (FIP) will focus on two main areas:
• Regulatory Engagement: Dialogue between authorities and with the private sector is critical to identify and address potential regulatory synergies, share lessons, and develop closer working relationships. The United States and United Kingdom will build on existing regulatory cooperation by discussing regulatory developments and sharing experiences on technical issues related to innovation in financial services.
• Commercial Engagement: The FIP also seeks to promote a dynamic private sector that supports entrepreneurs and new business models – a necessary driver of financial innovation. It will provide enhanced and regular opportunities for the private sector in one country to engage with industry associations, and market participants in the other country. Through the FIP, the UK Department for International Trade (DIT) will bring UK firms to the United States and the U.S. Commerce Department will coordinate trade promotion missions to the United Kingdom.

The Partnership was announced at the U.S.-UK Financial Regulatory Working Group, which was established to facilitate even closer collaboration on financial services issues between U.S. and UK Treasuries, and U.S. and UK financial regulators."
385,9,"First of a three-part series exploring the use of swaps, asset-based lending and foreign currency exchange to balance business risks and find opportunities.

With interest rates suddenly inching up, businesses big and small are considering converting adjustable rate loans to fixed rates. Traditional refinancing methods are always available, but there is another option.

Sophisticated fiduciaries at Fortune 500 companies have for years utilized derivatives known as interest rate swaps in order to better manage monetary risk.

Interest rate swaps are, in their simplest form, an exchange of payments. One party in the swap trades the flexible rate on its debt to a fixed set of interest payments for a number of years – say five percent over 10 years. The other party receives adjustable rate payments, which are indexed to interest rates, usually the one or three month LIBOR rate.

But in practice, interest rate swaps can be complicated and smaller to mid-sized companies might believe the derivatives game is beyond their scope of financial wherewithal or perhaps too risky to manage effectively.

Not so. Today, more banks – and not just the money center banks – offer interest rate swaps to their customers and will take care of all the paperwork, regulation compliance, accounting, and monitoring to make the process as streamlined as possible.

“These are tools being used by the major corporations to reduce risk,” said Michael Bontrager, founder and CEO of Chatham Financial, a global financial advisory services and technology firm based in Kennett Square, Pennsylvania. “Now, banks like Rockland Trust are saying that if you’re a smaller company you can have the same financial options – and protections – as the major corporations.”

In a way, Bontrager notes, banks that are offering rate swaps are “democratizing the ability of more companies to avail themselves of these products.”

So what exactly are rate swaps? Why would someone want to use the product? And how do they work?

It starts with the natural inclination of borrowers to generally want fixed-rate loans to better manage their costs and expectations. Banks, however, fund their loans with deposits that have fluctuating interest rates so managing net interest margins can be problematic, especially when short term rates are expected to increase. Therefore, the adjustable rate loans are lower risk and can be more preferable.

This common tension creates markets and opportunities for both banks and borrowers.

It’s a win for borrowers because they can convert some or all of their floating rate debt to fixed rates – good to do in the current rising rate environment – without going through the time and expense of a total refinancing. It’s a win for the bank because it finds a third party wishing to receive the fixed rate, while the bank retains the original adjustable rate. Because swapped loans are lower risk to the banks, the banks can then be more competitive on pricing, passing some of the benefit back to the borrower.

In other words, the borrower is able to hedge their risk by locking in a more competitive long term fixed rate, while the bank takes on an adjustable rate loan that enables them to more adequately manage their margins. Interest rate swaps are traded over the counter, and if a company decides to exchange interest rates, it will need to agree, in theory, with another party on such things as length and terms of the swap. But mostly the bank handles those arrangements and the original borrower is not involved directly in those issues.

Getting Under The Hood

The mechanics of how it’s all done involves several parties – the bank’s customer, the bank, and a counter-party or swap dealer that the bank’s borrower never sees. A large money center bank – such as Deutsche Bank, J.P. Morgan, Wells Fargo or Bank of America – serves as a swap dealer. These are companies that make markets in swap trading and take positions in the swap markets for their own accounts.

Riding herd on all of this are companies like Chatham Financial, which is an independent advisor for both the bank and the customer.

“The advisor is there to make sure pricing is appropriate and the terms are structured properly,” said Rockland Trust’s Nelson. “Some customers may be new to swaps or may feel they don’t have the expertise, so firms like Chatham will guide them through the process.”

Chatham’s Bontrager notes that one of the advantages of a swap is it separates the debt decisions of corporate treasurers from the interest rate decisions.

“Normally, those decisions are made simultaneously,” he said. “Swaps put a lot more control and flexibility in the hands of the treasurer.”

There are other advantages, as well. Fixed rate loans typically carry pre-payment penalties while swaps may carry penalties in a falling rate environment, but they can create a realized gain if rates go up and the borrower elects to terminate the swap.

Greg Vickowski, the chief financial officer of The Procaccianti Group, a privately held real estate investment and management company based in Cranston, R.I, has been utilizing swaps for nearly 30 years. His company buys hotels that are usually underperforming and renovates and rebrands them. Initially, he said, banks are less willing to commit to fixed-rate loans until the property stabilizes.

“At that time we might swap all or some of the debt for a fixed-rate,” Vickowski said. “It’s highly advantageous and certainly less expensive and more efficient than refinancing an entire loan.”

Vickowski notes, however, that nearly three-fourths of Procaccianti’s debt is in so-called CMBS instruments (commercial mortgage-backed securities) that have little flexibility and are not offered by most traditional banks because they tend to be more complex and volatile than residential mortgage-backed securities.

“There’s a large population that doesn’t want to deal with CMBS shops because it can be slow, impersonal, cumbersome, inflexible and expensive,” he said. “That’s why banks like Rockland can prosper in this market.

Deciding If Swaps Are The Right Choice

Financial experts say some of the factors in the decision matrix about swaps would include:
• How sensitive is my business to interest rate changes?
• What percentage of my debt is fixed versus fluctuating?
• How much certainty do I have in my borrowing?
• Are there things coming in the next year that could drive up my debt?

“Adjustable rates have done really well over the last 10 years,” said Nelson. “But, given the current direction of short term rates, borrowers may now want to manage some risk by floating only a portion of it and moving some to a fixed rate.”

There are, of course, inherent risks in rate swaps. Chief among them is the fact that interest rates are unpredictable. Swaps carry a market value that fluctuates with market rates. As rates change the borrower may float into an unrealized gain or loss position. If the borrower looks to exit their swap, their position will be monetized. Another risk involves the additional level of complication in managing one’s debt portfolio.

Most of the risks can largely be mitigated by dealing with reputable institutions in strong financial positions and relying on well-established companies to represent the customers and the banks. Rockland Trust has successfully executed more than $1 billion in swap loans since 2009.

With rates on the rise, many experts believe there will be an increased interest in rate swaps.

386,9,"Whether it’s hunting for minibeasts in the playing fields or reading a book under a tree, the positive impact of outdoor learning on young people’s achievement and development is widely acknowledged.

But what do you do if your school isn’t blessed with acres of green space? From making the most of your playground to venturing further afield, we’ve gathered five tips to help urban schools feel the benefits of taking learning outside.

It might sound simple but the first thing to do is get outside. As Ian Tokelove from London Wildlife Trust says: “Ask yourself if a game or activity could work outside. If it could, then go for it.”

It could be as simple as asking students to close their eyes and tune into the sounds of the urban world.

Games such as follow-my-leader or hide and seek are good for familiarising students with their outdoor space. Older pupils could map the school grounds, identifying their favourite areas and explaining their choices.

Nicole Daw, a National Trust ranger at Leigh Woods, Bristol, finds a colour-matching activity works well. She says: “Using some paint charts from your local DIY shop, ask pupils to go outside and find colours that match the charts. Green is a great place to start, but it is incredible how many colours are out there once you really start looking.”

One of the great things about outdoor learning is that it spans the curriculum, so you could measure the angles of outdoor structures in maths, investigate how far sounds travel in different weather in science, or use the playground as the setting for a historical re-enactment.

At the beginning work with subjects and activities you already feel comfortable with. So if you like doing music inside, take music outside. As Elaine Skates, chief executive of the Council for Learning Outside the Classroom, says: “Using your school grounds as a starting point will help build your confidence in teaching in locations other than the classroom.”

If you’re pressed for time, plan outdoor activities for just before or after a break time. In secondary schools, arrange to meet your class at an agreed outdoor spot and for primary schools, practise getting outdoor clothes on and off quickly, and keep them in an easily accessible place such as a dressing up box.

Encourage nature to come to you

Mini wildlife gardens, which stay be outside but don’t take much space, are another good idea: bug hotels, bucket ponds and bird boxes are easy and fun to make, and children will enjoy checking to see what creatures have made their homes in them.

For very small, concrete playgrounds, Natalie Johnson from The Wild Network suggests bringing in a few old logs or branches from fallen trees to encourage wildlife. For schools with a little more space, you could apply for a free school tree pack from the Woodland Trust. The pack contain 30 saplings, which would cover a space equivalent to the size of one tennis court or create an 8.5m line of hedge.

Wildflowers can be grown on a scrap of land; even a small area in the middle of a city will attract wildlife.

Planting seeds and bulbs indoors lets children get their hands dirty and helps them understand basic lifecycles. “Watching something grow from seed is magical and fills children with a sense of investment in a little life,” says Tokelove. “It could be a bean planted in a pot on a windowsill or a young sapling planted when a child starts primary school so they can see how it grows with them.”

Alternatively, you could catch some bugs in outdoor pitfall traps and bring them inside for students to identify using magnifying glasses.

Draw on your local community to find people who can share resources. Parents might be able to get rid of old outdoor clothing or footwear, or ask a local garden centre if they could donate plants or expertise.

And don’t forget to bring the outside in with evidence of what you’ve been doing. Indoor displays could include photographs, items that pupils have gathered, and rubbings of different outdoor surfaces.

Look for opportunities on your doorstep

Ideally you want to sit down as a team and have a think about what’s within a 10- or 20-minute walk from your school. There might be shops, a high street or even an art gallery or museum.

As Skates says: “For any school, it’s really about what is on their doorstep and remembering that learning can take place in the built environment just as much as the rural environment.”

Rather than being a one-off, outings should be a regular part of school life, involving all learners in a year-round, progressive programme that fosters an appreciation of the natural world according to Martin Smith, chair of the English Outdoor Council, an umbrella body for organisations involved in the provision of outdoor education.

He adds: “See going outdoors as integral to what you do and not ‘separate’. The outdoor environment is just another resource for you to use.

“One day all learning will have to be applied outside the classroom, so let’s start early.”

This could be a park, nature reserve or woodland. Discover the wildlife that lives there using hands-on activities such as pond dipping, bug hunting and nature trails.

Activities run by environmental organisations such as Learning Through Landscapes, the Institute for Outdoor Learning and the John Muir Trust are particularly good.

You might also want to look for the Learning Outside the Classroom quality mark or consult with a local outdoor education adviser when selecting a venue.

London Wildlife Trust is one of 47 Wildlife Trusts that provide outdoor learning opportunities to schools across the UK. As Tokelove says: “Together, we have more nature reserves than McDonald’s has restaurants, so you’re never far from a nature reserve, even in a city.”

It is worth remembering that outdoor learning experiences are more likely to be successful if you involve young people in their planning and delivery. Pupils can research venues, organise fundraising activities and get involved in any risk-benefit assessment.

Another good tip is to share ideas and inspiration with like-minded teachers through local schools and networks. The London Environment Educators Forum, for example, runs events to help practitioners build their skills and share best practice in connecting people to urban nature.

The most important thing to remember is that the more you do outdoor learning, the easier it gets. And the benefits for young people – and their teachers – abound.

388,9,"The next Supreme Court justice will shape civil and constitutional rights jurisprudence in the country for decades to come. In nominating Brett Kavanaugh, Donald Trump has followed through on his threat to nominate a justice who would undermine basic rights and freedoms.

His record is clear: Brett Kavanaugh poses a direct threat to LGBTQ equality, reproductive rights, affordable healthcare, immigrants’ rights, workers’ rights and so much more.

Need further evidence? Just look at what some of our anti-equality opponents had to say about Trump’s Supreme Court nominee:

Jim Daly, president of the anti-LGBTQ organization Focus on the Family, praised Trump’s choice of Kavanaugh in an interview with the Washington Post, calling him a “top-drawer candidate.” Daly said that “the main reason Christian conservatives voted for President Trump was on the question of judges.”

Anti-LGBTQ Family Research Council President Tony Perkins said that the organization looks forward to having someone with Kavanaugh's “philosophical approach” and that the organization is committed to helping “move the grassroots” to secure the nomination.

Marjorie Dannenfelser, president of the anti-choice Susan B. Anthony List, called Kavanaugh's nomination “another outstanding choice” for Trump. The organization praised Trump for fulfilling his promise in nominating a judge with a record of condemning abortion access.

Carol Tobias, president of the anti-choice NRLC, commended Trump for his nomination of the “exceptionally well qualified” justice to the Supreme Court. “All too often, democratically enacted laws to protect unborn children and other vulnerable humans have been overridden by judges who abuse their power to impose their own policy preferences,” said Tobias.

“This is why conservative women voted overwhelmingly for Donald J. Trump,” said Penny Nance, CEO of the conservative organization. According to Nance, Trump’s nominations of both Gorsuch and Kavanaugh are making good on his promises to affect the Supreme Court for generations.

In proclaiming its support for Trump’s choice, the anti-LGBTQ organization promised to “work hard” to secure Kavanaugh’s nomination against a “brutal” confirmation process.

Brian S. Brown, co-founder of NOM and infamous anti-LGBTQ leader, stated that he was “confident that (Kavanaugh) will join an opinion to overturn gay 'marriage' and restore traditional marriage to our nation's laws.”

Breitbart, a far-right news site associated with white nationalism, called Kavanaugh the “America First” choice. A story published on July 4 proclaimed that Kavanaugh applies “Trump’s economic patriotism” to the law, explaining how their views on immigration and labor align.

The NRA lauded Trump’s nomination as an “outstanding” nominee. “He has an an impressive record that demonstrates his strong support for the Second Amendment,” said Chris W. Cox, NRA executive director. Cox promised that the NRA would activate its millions of members and supporters to ensure Kavanaugh’s confirmation.

The stakes with this nomination could not be higher. We call on the U.S. Senate to fulfill its constitutional duty and reject this dangerous nominee. Text “Save SCOTUS” to 30644 to join HRC in this fight."
389,9,"When it comes to the milk America drinks, cows shouldn't get all the credit. Dairy farmers like Dave and Laurie Kyle of Elkhorn, Wis., put in just as much hard work as their bovine counterparts.

Morning for these dairy producers starts early. By 4:30, the Kyles and their farmhands are up for the first of two rounds of milking their 110 registered Holstein cows. While the cows are in the milking parlor, Dave is busy cleaning the barn, replenishing bedding and filling watering units with fresh water. Next, it's time to feed the girls a nutritious breakfast of farm-grown hay, corn and silage (a high-moisture feed that is often made from grass crops that provides many of the nutrients present in plants) mixed with soybean meal and Milwaukee malted rye. (During the warmer months, the cows also graze on fresh pasture.) Dave meets with a local nutritionist weekly, and feed blends are customized to meet each cow's current dietary needs, based on her weight and milk production level. Afternoons are more varied, yet still just as busy. In the summer, it's often the time to hop on the tractor and harvest feed crops. When the Kyles aren't harvesting, they'll often tend to other tasks, such as any variety of farm-related repairs.

""When you're a farmer, you have to be good at being an electrician, plumber and mechanic, because you can't really afford to pay outside vendors,"" Laurie admits.

There's also checking in with veterinarians and testing milk for quality and safety. This includes testing for antibiotic residues — a process that takes place up to eight times before the milk is sent to the local processing plant. Setting aside time each day to simply observe the cows' behavior is also essential to ensure that they're healthy. On some days, the Kyles give farm tours, too. ""It's cool to see kids' faces light up when they pet the calves that were born a week ago, because most families don't know where their food comes from,"" says Laurie.

While Dave spends much of his day on the farm, Laurie, a nutrition educator, can usually be found at Perkup Elkhorn, the coffee shop she opened in 2012 to forge deeper community connections and earn additional income. ""Because I'm passionate about agriculture and healthy eating, it seemed like a perfect fit. The message that I have is that American agriculture is alive and well, and farmers are still some of the most trustworthy individuals that are providing wholesome products for all,"" she says. When she isn't chatting with customers about milk's vast nutritional benefits, she's tackling bookwork for the farm in the back office.

Dave might stop in for a bit to discuss bills, but it's back to the farm by 4:30 p.m. for the day's second round of milking, cleaning and feeding. After working as long as 17 hours, he finally arrives back home. Like most families, long days and busy schedules—including working around 16-year-old daughter Mackenzie’s travel softball games and practices and 20-year-old son Hayden’s college course load—mean the Kyles don't get to eat dinner together as often as they might like. But it's a small sacrifice to make in exchange for a truly rewarding outcome. ""Knowing you're producing wholesome products for people and doing it by rolling up your sleeves and working hard, there's a real pride involved in that,"" says Laurie."

Everyone has the occasional “senior moment.” Maybe you wander to the kitchen and can’t remember why, or you misplace your keys. But while these mental hiccups may be bothersome, they usually don’t drive you to visit the doctor.

Most people focus on physical problems – high blood pressure, pain, disability – but if your mental health isn’t functioning optimally, your physical health will suffer as well.

The good news: Studies show you can bolster your brain’s reserves and reduce your risk of losing your mind by adopting some basic health habits. Already in your golden years? Don’t fret. Research also shows the brain continues forming new connections throughout our lifespans. And you can help it along with these eight brain-boosting strategies:

Learning a second (or a third) language challenges the brain in new ways and may even delay the onset of dementia, according to recent research. Say you learn the word for mother in Spanish is “madre.” Initially, you may have to concentrate to remember that word, but if you practice, over time, it becomes part of your vocabulary. That easy recall proves your brain has laid down a new pathway.

Quick tip: Pick one night a week to speak in another language (however poorly), or stay silent and communicate with sign language.

Engaging in mentally challenging activities helps build a reserve of brainpower you can draw on for years. The key, of course, is choosing unfamiliar activities that you enjoy. Play chess, take up gardening or learn to play a musical instrument. It doesn’t matter what you choose, provided the activity is new to you.

Quick tip: If you’re a whiz at crossword puzzles, do a word search activity instead. Comfortable with writing exercises? Try your hand at drawing or painting.

Eating a diet rich in fruits, vegetables and whole grains, and low in saturated fat and sugar, can help protect brain networks. In fact, studies consistently show that eating a mix of nourishing foods—fruits, vegetables, nuts, fatty fish, and yes, even a daily glass of wine—sharpens your mind, builds new brain cells and fights off mental decline.

Quick tip: Keep a stash of trail mix in your pocketbook or glove box. The brain needs consistent fuel (at least every 3 to 5 hours) to function well.

Research consistently links physical exercise with brain benefits, particularly in the regions responsible for learning and memory. But don’t worry. You don’t have to spend 90 minutes in the gym to experience exercise’s mind-boosting effects. Even moderate exercise (say jogging, cycling or even walking) for about 30 minutes daily can get the blood flowing to your head.

Quick Tip: Preliminary research suggests the perks of physical activity are more pronounced when combined with a mental challenge. So things like taking a dance class, learning martial arts or practicing yoga may be especially beneficial.

Getting sufficient sleep is one of the best things you can do for your brain. While researchers aren’t entirely clear what happens in the mind when you’re snoozing, they do know that sleep is critical for the body and mind to function at their prime. Sleep not only reenergizes the body’s cells and clears out waste products from the brain, it also promotes learning and memory.

Quick tip: Strive to get seven to eight hours of sleep each night. Can’t manage to sleep that many hours in one stretch? Consider a daytime power nap.

6. Stay on top of your health conditions.

Just as your mind can help protect your body, keeping your body humming can protect your mind. Health conditions ranging from diabetes and high blood pressure to depression and hypothyroidism can impact how well your brain functions.

Quick tip: Protect your memory by following your doctor’s advice carefully, taking medications appropriately and reporting any changes in how your brain is functioning.

The brain needs time to restore itself and reflect. In fact, research links “thinking about not thinking” to a host of physical and mental health benefits. And emerging research suggests meditating regularly may even enhance your memory.

Quick tip: Take 10 to 15 minutes each day to quiet your mind and focus on only one thing: your breathing. Not only will you give your brain an opportunity to recharge, but the focused breaths will promote blood flow to it, too.

Maintaining close relationships requires a certain level of brainpower. Not only do you have to think fast to engage in conversation, but resolving conflicts and debating current affairs flexes mental muscles as well. So it’s no wonder studies suggest that socially active seniors are less likely to develop Alzheimer’s disease than their wallflower counterparts.

Quick tip: Develop friendships with people of different ages, races and ethnic backgrounds to increase the load on your brain. Processing differences in speech, tone, even the latest cultural lingo can challenge the brain to build new connections.

Above all, the easiest way to keep your mind sharp as you age is to develop a meaningful life. The combination of a healthy lifestyle, work that motivates you and a sense of purpose goes a long way in terms of safeguarding the brain.

If you notice a change in your memory, or if you find you’re struggling to think clearly, make an appointment to talk with your primary doctor or a specialist.

 ""While we lose muscle mass and our endurance slows as we age, what has always been assumed was part of the normal aging process is made much worse by having a sedentary lifestyle than by merely aging,"" said John Hanrahan, Fitness Center coordinator at Westminster Place, a Presbyterian Homes retirement community in suburban Chicago. ""The saying 'use it or lose it' is absolutely true. We can add muscle to improve strength, increase cardiovascular endurance and improve balance at any age.""

 

 A study published in June by the Oregon State University College of Public Health and Human Sciences showed that 300 minutes a week of light exercise provides significant health benefits for people over age 65. Older adults who engaged in light exercise were 18% healthier overall than their less-active peers. Moreover, light exercise is less likely to cause injuries than moderate to vigorous exercise.

 

 According to OSU professor and study co-author Brad Cardinal, active older adults have lower body mass index, smaller waist circumferences and more balanced insulin levels and are less likely to be afflicted by chronic diseases.

 

 Westminster Place offers many options and opportunities for residents to improve and maintain their fitness. 

 

 ""We have a beautiful fitness center with a well-appointed gym and two pools,"" Hanrahan said. ""We offer group exercise classes for just about everyone. There are land and water classes, seated and standing classes at different times of the day spread throughout our campus.""

 

 Water aerobics, yoga and balance classes are among the more popular offerings, said Hanrahan, who thinks that adults should engage in water aerobics for the energy and group camaraderie, yoga for the physical, mental and perhaps spiritual aspects, and balance classes because balance is something that we all need to work on: ""Even some of us less than 'senior age,' since our balance begins to decline in our 30s."" 

 

 Exercise is part of the new initiative ""Choices: A Program for Living Well"" introduced at Presbyterian Homes and designed to focus on aspects of wellness identified by the International Council on Active Aging. 

 

 The program teaches the multidimensional aspects of healthy living, offering many choices for active older adults based on their interests. The content was based largely on feedback from residents at the five Presbyterian Homes communities in the Greater Chicago area. 

 

 Beyond physical health, the program includes six other wellness dimensions — social, emotional, spiritual, intellectual, community and environmental. The new program is part of a larger campaign by Presbyterian Homes to ensure that residents achieve the highest level of well-being in mind, body and spirit. 

 

 Residents at Westminster Place can also sign up for a national senior fitness test to track personal goals over time. And Hanrahan has designed a fitness boot camp that starts in October for adults seeking a more intense class or heavier workout to achieve their goals. 

 

 ""We'll focus on building strength and endurance by mixing cardio and strength exercises in functional and fun ways,"" Hanrahan said. ""It'll be a new program for us, but I think people will really enjoy it."""

393,9,"A day in the life of a diabetes patient is an exercise in micromanagement. Blood sugar metering. Insulin injections. Meal plans. Exercise diaries. Logs filled with heart rate, blood pressure, and even pain measurements. It’s a lot to keep up with, for doctors as well as patients, but it’s also absolutely crucial. Proper diabetes management is key to a patient’s quality of life and to keeping blood sugar levels in line.

For the 387 million people in the world living with diabetes, this is reality. But in many ways, their experience is not so different from that of the rest of us, who struggle to stay on top of our health and to effectively communicate to our health providers what’s going on with our bodies. In America, about half of all adults suffer from chronic illnesses, and according to a 2013 Pew Research Center study, among those who do track their health, about half of them keep up with progress “in their heads.”

Mobile app development, fueled by cloud technology, is going to change these habits dramatically. Already, wearable technologies, such as Fitbit, and food trackers, are helping us log our meals, movement, and weight. These seemingly simple devices have transformative powers. They have been proved to keep people motivated to exercise and lose weight. According to the Pew study, tracking also leads 40 percent of trackers to ask a doctor new questions or to get a second opinion.

But digital tools are pushing healthcare to the cusp of a much larger transformation than that. Apps designed to improve our health are going far beyond simple one-feature tracking and peer support. The new apps are capable of sharing, analyzing, and visualizing real-time health data across different platforms and populations, inspiring a host of possibilities.

These “wellness 2.0” apps will provide ways for people to take control of their own health and promise to transform our healthcare system by giving doctors valuable new insights and researchers clues to the prevention and management of chronic illness.

“The opportunity to put powerful but simple tools in the hands of an individual...as they try to manage their condition is so compelling,” says Sean M. Hogan, VP and General Manager of IBM Healthcare. “It is absolutely going to change the face of medicine.”

Robin Hrassnigg was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes in 1991. He filled out the usual logs and diaries until he created Diabetizer, a Web-based diabetes-management portal that will launch this fall as a mobile app for iOS and Android named myDIABETIZER. “In the past, you had the diary and, with pen and paper, you put the information in the book. That’s the normal, old way,” says Hrassnigg. “What we give the diabetic is a complete overview about his or her health status, and this information can also be used to discuss the condition with their doctor.”

Diabetizer works by pulling in information from a number of digital tools, including Fitbit, Runkeeper, and nutrition apps. It meshes that data with glucose readings and insulin information and presents an overall picture of health. Among its most useful features: A risk-index screen shows whether blood sugar, cholesterol, BMI, or any number of other indicators is in the danger zone. Graphs allow users to look back over the past week or even the past year to see how weight, heart rate, or blood sugar has fluctuated or to pick up on patterns—maybe blood sugar is spiking on a day after too little exercise, for example.

“The app makes it all easy to handle,” explains Hrassnigg. “You get more motivated in using it because it makes it fun and you get accurate information that you can look back over for yourself. You can look at your information on your mobile in your free time. That is a big advantage [if you want to discuss] your condition with your doctor and for getting a feel for your own health indicators.” Doctors are able to receive a PDF of a patient's latest health stats from the app, via email."

You're having a totally normal night at your friend's party when the guy from across the room comes over to chat you up. You find out, shockingly, you have quite a bit in common.

After you exchange numbers, you reside in the warm habitat of possibility. He hasn't screwed anything up yet or burst your expectations.

Your ignorance to what your future with him may hold is bliss.

Once he finally texts a few days later, you're stoked. You told your friends you didn't expect to hear from him again after your short makeout sesh, but, obviously, you were lying.

You start thinking about all of the speakeasies you've been to in the past few months and mentally cataloged for first dates. Then, he drops a bomb you should have seen coming: “How about we stay in and watch a movie?”

He essentially just asked you to ""Netflix and chill."" Cue the whirlwind of thoughts that start circling through your mind.

1. A night in? He totally gets me. That's exactly what I want to do.

2. I didn't feel like getting dressed up and going out anyway.

3. What movie should we watch? What movie sets the tone for a first date?

4. It cannot be a sad movie. I can't cry in front of him. I just can't.

5. It can't be too funny, either. My laugh-snort is NOT hot.

6. Maybe we should binge-watch a TV show.

7. But if we binge-watch, how long will this date last?

8. I definitely need an out. I'll ask a friend to be on-call with a fake emergency.

9. But I'm not going to need to call her because this is my ideal date. Like, he could be my soul mate.

10. What if he's my soul mate?

11. If he is my soul mate, we need to watch something classy so our future grandchildren can be proud of us.

12. Hold on. The last guy who did this tried to get me to sleep with him. Is that what this guy is doing?

13. Ugh, he's totally pulling a Netflix and chill, isn't he? This is a booty call.

14. He should have asked me to dinner. Don't I deserve dinner?

15. When I met him at the party, was I giving off a one-and-done vibe?

16. I knew I shouldn't have made out with him.

17. But if I end up liking him, we will hook up eventually anyway.

18. He might not respect me if we hook up on a first date.

19. What if I end up genuinely liking him and then he never talks to me again?

20. I would hate him if he ghosted me.

21. It's not like I don't want to hook up with him, though. We can just keep it casual.

22. It's totally okay to do this. I don't even know for sure he's only interested in a hookup.

23. I'm going to screen-shot this text message and send it to my girlfriends. They'll know what to do.

24. Okay, they agree. I should go and feel it out. I'm telling him I'm down.

25. I guess we're going to do it at his place.

26. Correction: We're NOT going to “do it.”

27. Should I suggest hanging at my place so I can control the situation?

28. My roommates are gonna make it weird if we're here, though.

29. Are we hanging in his living room?

30. His roommates might make it weird.

31. We can always go into his bedroom.

32. Then it's really going to seem like a booty call.

33. Maybe I shouldn't shave my legs, then I won't let it go too far.

34. I should definitely shave my legs. It's a jungle down there.

35. But I will not get a wax.

36. If we order in, I'll know he's into more than a hookup.

37. Should I ask him if we're going to have food?

38. That would not be chill. I'll just eat beforehand.

39. But I'm not going to eat too much because I can't use his bathroom. And, God forbid, gas.

40. Better yet, I'll bring a snack. A snack and alcohol.

41. I wonder if he likes wine. Maybe he's more of a beer guy? Beer guys are so cute.

42. I can't drink too much. I'm a sloppy drunk.

43. But I'm really cute when I'm tipsy. I'm definitely going to get tipsy.

44. What am I going to wear?

45. I'm not going to wear a dress, or stretchy clothes.

46. I'll wear jeans and a cute top. But not too cute. We are staying in, after all.

47. Ugh, he should have taken me to dinner. Then I could have worn my top with the lace. That would have been perfect.

48. This is going to be so fun. It's going to be great. As long as we don't use my Netflix account; he can't see my recently watched list.

49. I wonder if he put this much thought into his suggestion.

51. I'm going to die alone."
395,9,"“Queer” is a word with a complicated modern history – both used in a defiant chant originated by LGBTQ rights activists more than a quarter century ago to confront bigotry, and hijacked by hate-mongers doubling down on discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity.

While we have been using the “Q” in much of our work for years, HRC has now officially embraced the word’s positive evolution, joining other advocates, supporters and new-generation activists who are taking back “queer” from those who still seek to use it as a slur.

“We celebrate the journey of this word, and our movement, reclaiming with others what was once used as a cudgel against us, and recognizing the reality of how more and more LGBTQ people identify themselves,” said HRC President Chad Griffin.

In HRC’s groundbreaking 2012 survey of self-identified LGBTQ youth, hundreds of respondents used “queer” to describe their sexual orientation or ""genderqueer"" to describe their gender identity, and many others wrote in their own descriptions of more fluid identities. The reality captured by the survey prompted HRC to begin using LGBTQ in its youth-related programs and work, including HRC Foundation’s annual conference for teachers, counselors, social workers and other adults who work with LGBTQ youth.

“Queer” serves as an umbrella term that encompasses many people as it intersects with sexual orientation and gender identity. It includes anyone who does not associate with heteronormativity, rather they have non-binary or gender expansive identities."
396,9,"OLYMPIA, WASH. – On May 7, 2019, Governor Jay Inslee signed into law Senate Bill 5116, which mandates that the state gets 100 percent of its electricity from clean sources by 2045. The passage positions Washington as a national leader in the transition to a clean, affordable, and reliable energy future.

Washington state’s announcement comes at a time when both the reality of the climate crisis and the practical steps to solve it have never been clearer.

Eighteen of the 19 hottest years on record have occurred since the beginning of this century, and alongside these increases in global temperatures, weather events like major hurricanes, floods, and droughts have become more frequent and severe. But with clean energy and energy storage becoming more affordable and widely available, we have the solutions today to solve this crisis.

The Climate Reality Project’s Washington state chapters in Bellingham, Snohomish County, Seattle, Tacoma, and Thurston County, as well as Climate Reality Leaders in other parts of the state, joined forces as the Washington State Coalition, under the guidance of the Environmental Priorities Coalition. The coalition worked to get the state legislature to commit to transition to a safer, more sustainable energy future for the Evergreen State.

Climate Reality Leaders and chapter members were instrumental in the passage of the bill. They assisted in sending 415 emails to state senators in support of the legislation, and hosted more than 10 meetings with representatives from Everett, Mukilteo, Seattle, Bellevue, Redmond and Kirkland, Olympia, and the Snohomish County Public Utilities Department (PUD). Their collective efforts also prompted 10 businesses to sign on in support of the statewide initiative.

“Today was a momentous occasion for all Washingtonians with the passing of SB 5116,” said Ali Lee, co-chair of The Climate Reality Project: Seattle, WA Chapter and the 100% Committed WA state campaign chair. “We rallied chapters and Climate Reality Leaders across the state to make calls, publish articles, and meet with legislators to help pass this bill. Thank you all for this truly statewide effort, working together as Climate Reality Leaders in coalition with other like-minded organizations for 100 percent clean electricity.”

The bill phases out coal from the electricity grid by the end of 2025 and makes swift progress toward cutting further carbon pollution by setting an interim target of carbon-neutral electricity by 2030.

SB 5116 invests in low-income communities to correct historic energy inequities through a cumulative impact analysis in the development of clean energy action plans, and funding made available for energy assistance to low-income households. The bill also invests in Washington workers as part of the transition to clean electricity, prioritizing jobs with livable wages.

The passage of the bill positions Washington state as a national leader in the transition to clean electricity with a dedicated focus on correcting historic climate injustices and lifting up the vulnerable communities often most affected by the climate crisis.

Founded by Nobel Laureate and former US Vice President Al Gore, The Climate Reality Project is working to catalyze a global solution to the climate crisis by making urgent action a necessity across every level of society. With a global movement more than five million strong and a grassroots network of trained Climate Reality Leader activists, we are spreading the truth about the climate crisis and building popular support for clean energy solutions. For more information, visit www.climaterealityproject.org or follow us on Twitter at @ClimateReality.

A Climate Reality chapter is a local group of climate activists in the United States that share The Climate Reality Project’s mission of supporting action to combat the climate crisis so we can make the transition to a clean energy economy and protect the welfare of the planet and its citizens.

Our chapters provide an immediate way for everyday Americans to connect and network with other climate activists, recruit additional volunteers, take action, and become a powerful force for climate solutions in their communities. Learn more at https://www.climaterealityproject.org/chapters."
397,9,"When my boss told me I was being sent to Chattahoochee Hills, Georgia to cover TomorrowWorld 2015, my brain couldn’t work fast enough to give any response other than, “Me? Really?”

Electronic dance music is one of those genres of music with a reputation. Everyone has an image in their heads of the prototypical EDM festival-goers: they’re in their early-to-mid twenties, wearing neon and flower crowns, dancing with no abandon.

That’s not exactly me. I’m more acoustic guitar, less bass drop. To the point where, in telling my friends that I was covering the biggest EDM festival in the US, I got the same reaction across the board: “You? Really?”

Armed with that arsenal of glowing support, I hopped in a cab to JFK Airport absolutely terrified that I was going to stick out like a sore thumb in the TomorrowWorld crowd. Was I going to look like a narc? I immediately regretted not hitting up the craft store to fashion my very own flower crown.

The nerves kept bubbling up throughout the flight to Georgia, and in the car with the Elite Daily crew as we drove out to the festival. The city scape of Atlanta transformed into farmland in the blink of an eye. I had read that TomorrowWorld USA takes place in a magical forest location, but I didn’t realize that was the first step in a total break from reality."
398,9,"Top treatments, new breakthroughs, education and lifestyle changes are winning the battle against heart disease

In the not-so-distant past, patients suffering from heart disease had a very different experience than patients do today. As recently as a couple decades ago, heart attack patients were likely admitted to a hospital’s coronary care unit where doctors could monitor the patient but didn’t have a lot of options when it came to saving the heart muscle, according to Kirit Patel, M.D., medical director of the cardiac catheterization lab and chief of division of cardiology at St. Joseph Mercy Oakland.

“Twenty-five to 30 years ago there were no stents available and we didn’t even know to give aspirin to heart attack patients,” Patel says. “Now, patients have angioplasty or stents and go home the next day. That’s how fast technology has moved.”

Today – although angioplasty, stents and other artery-opening procedures are still widely used – cardiovascular treatment has changed, with more of a focus on advanced minimally invasive procedures that have transformed heart disease from a possible death sentence to a treatable condition that patients live with for years.

“[In the past,] treatment was driven by coronary artery blockages. Emergency procedures, angiograms, stents and open-heart surgery were 85 percent of what we did,” says William W. O’Neill, M.D., medical director of the Center for Structural Heart Disease at the Henry Ford Heart and Vascular Institute. “The good news is the epidemic is abating and we are seeing fewer heart attacks. We have patients now with coronary artery disease who are relatively stable.”

That means doctors are treating older patients – even in their 90s – and seeing conditions that used to be somewhat rare become more prominent.

“We are seeing more patients with atrial fibrillation, a condition that one-third of those over the age of 80 have,” O’Neill says. “There’s also more valvular disease because as we age, our valves wear out. There used to be a lot of open-heart surgeries, but now there are a wide variety of ways to fix the heart without open-heart surgery. That’s where it’s at now.”

Those in the medical profession expect research and technology will continue to move at a rapid pace, according to Tom Davis, M.D., medical director for cardiovascular research and the cardiac catheterization labs at St. John Hospital and Medical Center.

“We are reinventing ourselves every five years,” Davis says. “Everything I do today is completely different than when I started in 1993.”

Davis says he expects to see a continued push to minimally invasive strategies to treat heart patients.

“I expect soon we will see more heart surgeries done in an outpatient setting,” he says. “There will be shorter procedures and the patient will go home the same day.”

O’Neill says regenerating heart muscles with stem cell therapy and tissue engineering, where parts such as valves will be individually made using 3D models, are also on the horizon.

“This is not science fiction or something that is light years away,” he says. “It’s very realistic that we will see these procedures 10 years from now.”

A new class of LDL-cholesterol-lowering drugs called PCSK9 inhibitors, which don’t have the side effects of statins, will also be a game-changer, O’Neill says. Though the injectable drug is quite expensive – about $14,000 for a one-year supply – and only currently FDA-approved for those with familial hypercholesterolemia, a genetic condition that causes up to three times the normal level of LDL cholesterol, and certain patients who require more lowering of LDL than they are getting with statins, O’Neill says he expects all that to change in the near future.

“These drugs can dramatically lower cholesterol,” he says. “If there is widespread use, we will see coronary artery disease disappear from society.”

401,1,"DALLAS – A construction crane buffeted by high winds during a storm toppled on a Dallas apartment building Sunday, killing one woman in the building and injuring five other people, two of them critically, a fire official said.

Crews searching the Elan City Lights building found the body of a woman inside after the crane collapsed and ripped a large gash into the side of the five-story structure, Dallas Fire-Rescue spokesman Jason Evans said during a press briefing.

“The building itself has suffered multiple collapses in different areas of the building to include residential spaces and the parking garage,” Evans said.

Of those injured, two were listed in critical condition, two suffered serious injuries and one suffered minor injuries and was later discharged from a hospital, Evans said. Earlier, he had said that six people were injured but said the figure would likely change.

First responders searched every apartment they could reach and found no other victims, Evans said. He also said that every resident of an apartment damaged by the crane was either out at the time or was among those taken to hospitals.

Crews were called to the site of the collapse just before 2 p.m., after the National Weather Service issued a severe thunderstorm watch for the Dallas/Fort Worth area and warned of winds up to 70 mph (113 kph). Evans said the reason the crane fell is unknown but there is a “strong possibility” that the winds “played some role in the collapse.”

Across Dallas the storm felled mature trees and knocked out power Sunday, leaving many areas without working traffic lights.

Isaiah Allen told the Dallas Morning News he was in his apartment when he heard what he thought was a deafening thunderclap. “I saw that the crane had actually fell straight through the building and had destroyed a good eight to 10 apartments and so there’s like floors and stuff falling through,” he said.

Allen told the paper he saw a bloodied woman trapped in her apartment on the second floor.

Yesenia Bosquez’s family had moved into their top-floor apartment just two weeks ago. She returned from a shopping trip to find her apartment, where she’d left her husband, Jay, to recover from a shoulder injury, crushed by the twisted metal.

It took about 30 minutes for authorities to tell her that her husband had been rescued alive and had been holding their dog while medics worked on his injuries.

Video shows that the downed crane ripped a large hole in the east side of the building and landed on an adjacent parking garage.

The company that owned the crane, Bigge Crane and Rigging Co., said in a statement it was mobilizing personnel to the site to find out more about the crane collapse and would cooperate with any investigation.

Evans said “every single level of the parking garage in part has collapsed” and that multiple vehicles were damaged. He said he was not sure if anybody was in the garage at the time of the collapse.

Rescue personnel used dogs to try to find people who might be trapped inside the rubble."

406,1,"SYDNEY (Reuters) - Evonne Goolagong Cawley led the way as Australia hailed their new Grand Slam tennis champion Ash Barty on Sunday after the proudly indigenous 23-year-old ended the country’s 46-year wait for a French Open women’s singles champion.

Margaret Court and Goolagong Cawley between them won four of the first six titles at Roland Garros after the dawn of the open era and the lack of Australian success since has reflected a wider decline of the women’s game Down Under.

That Barty’s victory over Marketa Vondrousova on Saturday was only the second for an Australian in a Grand Slam women’s final in the 39 years since Goolagong Cawley won her seventh major at Wimbledon made the outpouring all the more understandable.

Goolagong Cawley, Australia’s first indigenous global sports star, was Barty’s role model as a child and the 67-year-old said she was delighted not only at the breakthrough but also the style of game the Queenslander displayed in her win.

“What a wonderful result for Australia and how exciting that another Aboriginal has won at the French,” she said on Sunday.

“Tennis Australia and all lovers of tennis here and around the world will be delighted by the natural skills and flair Ash possesses.

“Now they have developed into a beautiful game full of artistry, movement and power. It was there for all to marvel at in Paris.”

The decline in the Australian men’s game from the dominant days of the 1950s, 1960s and early 1970s came more slowly than in the women’s but has been no less marked with no Grand Slam champions since Lleyton Hewitt at Wimbledon in 2002.

Most concerning for some in Australia has been the on and off-court antics of the two men who at various times have looked most likely to break that drought, Bernard Tomic and Nick Kyrgios.

Court, a Christian minister whose record 24 Grand Slam singles titles spanned the end of the amateur and start of the professional era, said she was particularly delighted at Barty’s demeanour.

“She is a very good role model,” the 76-year-old told the Western Australian newspaper.

“She is good for our nation. I think she is very refreshing. I was always taught when I was young that I was a role model for the young, a role model for the game and a role model for our nation. I was taught that.

“It was always our nation first and I think it’s so sad to see some players in the men’s side with such great talent, thinking they are bigger than the game. It’s sad.”

Sunday was a day of rejoicing rather than recriminations for most Australians, however, and 11-times major champion Rod Laver, Hewitt and Kyrgios were among a plethora of former Australian number ones to post their congratulations.

There was also a heartfelt congratulatory note from Australia’s most recent Grand Slam champion Sam Stosur, the 35-year-old who won the 2011 U.S. Open but was unable to build on that success.

“So happy and proud of you,” the world number 96 posted on Instagram next to a picture of Barty nursing the Suzanne-Lenglen Cup.

“Always knew you would achieve this incredible success! You have such a gift and determination and now the trophy to show ...”"

408,1,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China summoned global technology companies for talks last week following last month’s U.S. ban on selling technology to China’s Huawei Technologies Co Ltd, two people familiar with the matter told Reuters on Sunday.

The blacklisting of Huawei, the world’s largest maker of telecoms network equipment, bars U.S. companies from supplying it with many goods and services due to what Washington said were national security issues, a potentially crippling blow that sharply escalated U.S.-China trade tensions.

Soon afterwards, Beijing announced it would release its own list of “unreliable” foreign entities. It also has hinted that it will limit its supply of rare earths to the United States.

A person at U.S. software giant Microsoft Corp said the company’s session with Chinese officials was not a direct warning but it was made clear to the firm that complying with U.S. bans would likely lead to further complications for all sector participants.

The company was asked not to make hasty or ill-considered moves before the situation was fully understood, the person said, adding that the tone was conciliatory.

The New York Times first reported on the meetings led by the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), saying major foreign tech firms were warned against complying with a U.S. ban on selling American technology to Chinese firms or potentially face what the newspaper described as dire consequences.

The NDRC did not immediately reply to a faxed request for comment from Reuters.

It is not unusual for China to summon representatives of foreign and domestic companies, sometimes in groups, to make its views heard.

One person with another U.S. tech company in China who was briefed by colleagues on the company’s meeting told Reuters that the tone was “much softer” than expected.

“No mentioning of Huawei. No ultimatums. Just asked to stay in the country, contribute to the win-win negotiation,” the person said, declining to be identified by name or company given the sensitivity of the matter.

“I think they realise they still need U.S. tech and products for now; self-sufficiency will take a long time, and only after then they can kick us out,” the person said.

The New York Times reported that other companies summoned for meetings last Tuesday and Wednesday included U.S. computer maker Dell Technologies Inc, South Korea’s Samsung Electronics Co Ltd and SK Hynix Inc, and British chip designer ARM, which last month halted supplies to Huawei.

Samsung and SK Hynix declined to comment. Dell did not immediately respond on Sunday to an emailed request for comment and a spokesperson for ARM could not immediately be reached.

Separately, the editor of China’s Global Times tabloid said on Saturday that Beijing was preparing to curb some tech exports to the United States. In a tweet, Global Times Editor-in-Chief Hu Xijin said that China “is building a management mechanism to protect China’s key technologies.”

“This is a major step to improve its system and also a move to counter U.S. crackdown,” he added. “Once taking effect, some technology exports to the U.S. will be subject to the control.”

Hu did not cite any named sources in his tweet. The Global Times is a tabloid published by the ruling Communist Party’s official People’s Daily.

Also on Saturday, Chinese state media outlet Xinhua reported that the NDRC would organise a study to establish a “national technological security management list system”.

Last week, Reuters reported that Facebook Inc was no longer allowing pre-installation of its apps on Huawei smartphones."
409,1,"Meghan Markle is back in the public, making her first official public appearance since giving birth to her baby boy Archie on May 6. Meghan accompanied Prince Harry for the Trooping the Colour celebration on June 8 in honor of Queen Elizabeth’s birthday. While Prince Harry and Meghan stood behind Prince William, Kate Middleton, and the rest of the royal family on the balcony of Buckingham Palace, some were confused by their placement. As it turns out, it all has to do with the royal hierarchy.

“She was not as prominent perhaps as some people might have expected, but there’s a pecking order,” Joe Little, Majesty managing editor previously told People. “There was no slight intended, but William being the older, more senior brother would go out [first] with his wife.”

Another royal source told People last year that “there’s no one laying this out, telling her where to stand. And there were a lot of kids who everyone would want at the front.”

During the beginning of the event, Meghan rode in a carriage alongside Harry, Kate, and Prince Charles’s wife Camilla Bowels, waving to the excited spectators. One notable absence from the celebration is Meghan and Harry’s son, Archie, who’s just over one month old. Archie was reportedly left with a royal caretaker.

This year’s Trooping the Colour marked one-year-old Prince Louis’s first official royal event. Perhaps little Archie will follow suit next year.

410,1,"BEIJING (Reuters) - “Foreign forces” are trying to hurt China by creating chaos in Hong Kong over an extradition bill that has prompted mass protests in the former British colony, an official Chinese newspaper said on Monday.

Riot police surrounded Hong Kong’s parliament early on Monday after what had been a peaceful protest against the bill descended into running clashes between police and protesters.

Hundreds of thousands had jammed Hong Kong’s streets earlier on Sunday to protest against the bill in the biggest demonstration in years. Many said they feared the bill put the city’s vaunted legal independence at risk.

Organizers said there were more than a million protesters, although police put the number at about 240,000.

The China Daily said in an editorial the bill was much-needed legislation.

“Any fair-minded person would deem the amendment bill a legitimate, sensible and reasonable piece of legislation that would strengthen Hong Kong’s rule of law and deliver justice,” it said.

“Unfortunately, some Hong Kong residents have been hoodwinked by the opposition camp and their foreign allies into supporting the anti-extradition campaign.”

Some protesters in the Special Administration Region (SAR)had been misled about the changes proposed in the bill, while others were trying to promote a political agenda, the English-language publication said.

“They have failed to realize that the opposition camp is using them merely as pawns in its maneuvers to reap political gains by damaging the SAR government’s credibility and reputation, or that some foreign forces are seizing the opportunity to advance their own strategy to hurt China by trying to create havoc in Hong Kong,” the China Daily said.

It did not say who those foreign forces might be.

Foreign governments have expressed concern at the proposed law, warning of the impact on Hong Kong’s reputation as an international financial hub and noting that foreigners wanted in China risked getting ensnared in Hong Kong.

Human rights groups have repeatedly cited the alleged use of torture, arbitrary detentions, forced confessions and problems accessing lawyers in China.

Hong Kong officials have defended the plans, even as they raised the threshold of extraditable offences to crimes carrying penalties of seven years or more.

Another Chinese newspaper, the widely read Global Times tabloid, said on Monday Hong Kong opposition groups and their international supporters were “politically hyping up” normal Hong Kong legislative activity.

The Hong Kong government would not back down, said the paper, which is published by the ruling Communist Party’s official People’s Daily.

“The Hong Kong SAR government and mainstream public opinion have worked hard for rule of law and righteousness, and will absolutely not give up halfway,” it said in an editorial in its main Chinese-language edition.

The protests were otherwise barely mentioned in mainland China.

A “Hong Kong” keyword search on China’s Twitter-like platform Weibo on Monday showed only posts from verified accounts, mainly government sites and media organizations.

One of the few posts that acknowledged the protests was from the pro-Beijing Hong Kong newspaper Wen Wei Po, which accused “Hong-Kong separatists” of organizing people clad in black to rush at police and cause a “clash”.

More specific terms associated with the protests, such as #OpposeChineseExtradition, were censored.

BBC and CNN reports on the protest were blanked out in China, although the channels can only be viewed in high-end hotels and a small number of apartment buildings and are not available to most Chinese."
411,1,"LONDON (Reuters) - Qatar and other countries have been talking to both Iran and the United States about de-escalation, Qatari Foreign Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman al-Thani said on Sunday, urging both sides to meet and find a compromise.

“We believe that at one point there should an engagement – it cannot last forever like this,” he told reporters in London on Sunday. “Since they are not willing to engage in further escalation, they should come up with ideas that open the doors.”

Sheikh Mohammed said several countries including Qatar, Oman Iraq and Japan had been urging de-escalation with the two sides.

“All these countries are concerned what escalation could lead to,” he said. “There were attempts by Qatar and by other countries in the region to de-escalate the situation: we have been speaking to the U.S. and we have been talking to the Iranians as well.”

“What we are trying to do is really to bridge the gap and create a conversation between the two parties as escalation is not going to benefit anyone in the region,” he said.

Tensions have risen between Iran and the United States in recent weeks after Washington reimposed economic sanctions on Iran after pulling out of a big-power nuclear deal, and sending forces to the Middle East in a show of force to counter what U.S. officials called Iranian threats to U.S. troops and interests."
412,1,"On Wednesday we added details to our FEC Itemizer database on nearly $763 million in contributions to the political nonprofit organizations — also known as 501(c)(4) groups — that have spent the most money on federal elections during the past eight years. The data is courtesy of Issue One, a nonpartisan, nonprofit advocacy organization that is dedicated to political reform and government ethics.

These contributions often are called “dark money” because political nonprofits are not required to disclose their donors and can spend money supporting or opposing political candidates. By using government records and other publicly available sources, Issue One has compiled the most comprehensive accounting of such contributions to date.

To compile the data, Issue One identified the 15 political nonprofits that reported spending the most money in federal elections since the Supreme Court decision in Citizens United v. FEC in early 2010. It then found contributions using corporate filings, nonprofit reports and documents from the Internal Revenue Service, Department of Labor and Federal Election Commission. One of the top-spending political nonprofits, the National Association of Realtors, is almost entirely funded by its membership and has no records in this data.

For each contribution, you can see the source document detailing the transaction in FEC Itemizer.

The recipients are a who’s who of national political groups: Americans for Prosperity, the National Rifle Association Institute for Legislative Action, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and Planned Parenthood Action Fund Inc. account for more than half of the $763 million in contributions in the data. There’s also American Encore, formerly the Center to Protect Patient Rights, one of the main conduits for the conservative financial network created by Charles and David Koch.

The largest donor is the Freedom Partners Chamber of Commerce, a Koch-organized business association that has contributed at least $181 million to the leading political nonprofits. Other donors include the Susan Thompson Buffett Foundation, which has given at least $25 million to the Planned Parenthood Action Fund, and major labor unions like the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, or AFSCME, which has given at least $2.8 million to Democratic political nonprofit organizations.

Also among the donors are major corporations like Dow Chemical (mostly giving to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce), gun manufacturers (to the NRA), 501(c)(3) charities and individuals.

You can read Issue One’s report on its work as well as its methodology for discovering the contribution records. Because many of the sources are documents that are filed annually, this data won’t be updated the same way that FEC Itemizer is for campaign finance filings, but it represents the most comprehensive collection of dark money contributions to date."
413,1,"NEWS OUTLETS call him “China’s Edward Snowden”. His fans worldwide call him “Brother Fu”—a tag now seen on T-shirts and in internet memes. Both labels are said to mortify Fu Xuedong, the shy Canadian-educated software engineer whose allegations about Chinese cyber-spying have been the summer surprise of 2024. Mr Fu has thrown this, the final year of Donald Trump’s second term, into turmoil with his allegation that China’s intelligence services, working with the country’s technology firms, have turned millions of cars in America, Europe and Asia into remote spying devices, letting Beijing track vehicles in real time, identify passengers with facial-recognition and even eavesdrop on them.

China denies the claims, which if confirmed would amount to the largest espionage operation in history. Yet the fury of its response sits uneasily with its talk of Mr Fu as a “fantasist” and “a historic liar”. A cyber-security specialist at an innovation laboratory in Shenzhen, he has now been on the run from Chinese agents for five weeks—the past four of which he has spent holed up in the American consulate in Istanbul, as diplomats and politicians wrangle over his fate. So far Mr Fu’s saga is one with no winners, but many losers—including some of the world’s largest firms and governments that have buckled at the first hint of Chinese anger.

But the most important loser may be an abstract principle: namely, the idea of an international rules-based order in which predictable, transparent legal principles bind even the mightiest states. The ordeal of Fu Xuedong—an owlish, soft-spoken man who seems stunned by his sudden notoriety—has vividly revealed the extent to which China’s commitment to the rule of law is conditional. As one senior diplomat ruefully puts it: “What China wants is really vague rules, and the right to interpret them.”

The earliest commercial casualties of Mr Fu’s whistleblowing were carmakers in America, Europe and Japan, whose share prices plunged after he posted a YouTube video describing how he stumbled on a secret backdoor seemingly built into millions of advanced, semi-autonomous vehicles. It allows access to the encrypted channels that send data back to carmakers and—in the other direction—carry messages such as traffic alerts, navigation advice and software updates to vehicles. Nearly three-quarters of the high-tech cars on the road today use Chinese-designed 5G mobile chips for these data transfers, after foreign carmakers bowed to Chinese pressure to adopt its technology as part of a deal to allow greater access to the mainland’s vast car market.

The cyber-espionage scandal has also hurt the reputations of more than one foreign government. After fleeing to Turkey from China Mr Fu, who was born in Hong Kong and who carries British-issued travel documents that afford some of the protections of full citizenship, initially sought sanctuary at the British consulate, having evaded alleged Chinese agents at Istanbul airport. But after some hours in a waiting room Mr Fu was asked to leave by British diplomats, who cited his dual Canadian and Hong Kong-Chinese nationality and urged him to seek consular help from those countries instead.

The British government denied claims by Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, a Republican with hawkish views on China, that this decision was a “craven surrender” linked to London’s ambitions to become a legal and financial hub for Chinese companies. Specifically, Mr Rubio charged that London, having lost ground to New York and Frankfurt in the wake of Brexit, is “desperate” to host a new standards-setting forum and venture-capital hub serving the Global Infrastructure Centre. The GIC is a Beijing-based clearing house for projects linked to what used to be called the Belt and Road Initiative, China’s ambitious project to link itself with Europe, Africa and the Middle East with new railways, ports, roads and data cables.

In addition to physical links, president-for-life Xi Jinping has also promoted less tangible bonds, including Chinese standards and norms of governance, through the GIC. Crucially, it decides which schemes are eligible for billions of dollars in Chinese loans and grants, and picks foreign firms as partners using opaque rules devised by Communist Party planners. London hopes to become the GIC’s favoured gateway to global capital markets, to the benefit of British-based bankers, lawyers and consultants.

Mr Fu never even made it to the Canadian consulate, whose diplomats informed him by telephone that they needed more time to study an urgent “red notice” issued by Interpol, the global police organisation, at the request of Chinese authorities. The notice, which is not legally binding, asked all 192 Interpol member countries to hold Mr Fu on suspicion of espionage, theft and undermining state security. Canadian opposition politicians have accused the prime minister, Doug Ford, of sacrificing Mr Fu in a bid to secure a controversial agreement opening Canada’s Arctic waters to Chinese oil tankers and other shipping, as sea-ice retreats.

After obtaining refuge at the American consulate, Mr Fu initially gave a flurry of media interviews by Skype. But internet access to the consulate was severely restricted the next day. American diplomats say Turkey has erected a version of China’s Great Firewall around the consulate under the terms of a previously secret bilateral security pact with China, ostensibly intended to curb Islamist militancy among Uighurs, a Turkic-speaking minority from China’s restive far-western region of Xinjiang.

All this has left the United States as Mr Fu’s superpower protector. The White House press secretary, Laura Ingraham, has repeatedly urged Turkey to allow the engineer to leave the country unmolested, calling Chinese criminal charges against him “fake news”. In Congress, both the House and Senate intelligence committees have issued subpoenas for Mr Fu to give evidence in Washington, DC, as soon as possible. Mr Rubio has offered to collect Mr Fu from Istanbul in person. But sadly for the software engineer, Mr Trump’s America is a distracted superpower, which has taken a wrecking-ball to the rules-based order. So its criticism of China’s disregard for long-standing rules and norms now rings hollow.

Mr Trump’s advisers remain as divided as they were when he first took office. The economic nationalists want him to use his so-called Section 301 powers to punish China for obliging carmakers to install technology that “steals American secrets and jobs through the same backdoor”, as Lou Dobbs, Mr Trump’s national economic-security adviser, put it. An unusual coalition including the bosses of Ford and General Motors, the European Union and the governments of Japan, Germany, Britain and France, wants Mr Trump to take China to the World Trade Organisation. But America has made a mockery of the WTO by picking trade fights with friends and enemies alike, and by refusing to appoint judges to its appeals body—opening the way for China to set up a rival body of its own.

America’s disdain for the rules-based order means its criticism of China now rings hollow

An obscure Chinese arbitration panel, originally created to hear disputes linked to the Belt and Road Initiative, was rebranded in 2022 as the Global Infrastructure Tribunal. With its first cases this embryonic trade court has offered glimpses of how a Chinese-led commercial order might work. Unlike the WTO, it draws no distinction between nations with state-directed and market economies. Its judges take a benign view of subsidies that claim to support national development. And though they talk a good game about intellectual-property protection, they have consistently taken the view that sovereign governments, rather than individual businesses, should have final say in patent disputes.

Attempts by the West to mount a united challenge to such Chinese swagger are hindered by another fight that the Trump administration has picked with its own allies, after the president’s withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal in 2018. When US Treasury officials sought to punish companies and banks that used dollars to buy and sell Iranian goods, notably oil, China created an alternative system for international payments in Chinese yuan, euros and Russian roubles, aimed at the Eurasian countries that form the backbone of the Belt and Road Initiative. The new system, powered by Chinese technology and encryption standards, has weakened both the dollar’s dominance in international business and the grip over cross-border banking long enjoyed by the SWIFT consortium, based in Belgium. Russia has used the new system to create banks immune to dollar-based American sanctions, with customers said to include the governments of Iran, Syria, Sudan and North Korea.

As Treasury officials find it harder to impose financial sanctions, American naval commanders are struggling to tighten the noose on China. In theory, China remains at loggerheads with its Asian neighbours over contested rocks in the South China Sea. But Chinese efforts to expand and fortify those reefs have been matched by diplomatic victories. It has pressed neighbours to declare much of the South China Sea off-limits to military exercises involving outside powers, using an innocent-sounding “code of conduct” between countries that border those contested waters. Some, like Singapore, have resisted calls to make the code binding. Others, like the Philippines and Vietnam, are being offered a share of oil- and gasfields controlled by China, and are wavering. For its Asian neighbours the political and economic costs of defying China, and of helping America police the high seas, are rising.

All in all, it would be unsurprising if Mr Fu felt a bit friendless just now. He has told interviewers that he decided to risk his career, and even his freedom, after concluding that autonomous vehicles were being turned into a global surveillance network by Chinese spies. Few others in this saga display so clear a sense of right and wrong. China’s vision for a new world order has emerged sooner than expected because the West, led by Mr Trump’s America, has beaten so hasty a retreat. Rarely mounting direct challenges, China has instead tested, probed and introduced ambiguities into every aspect of global governance. Established powers have not so much acquiesced as proved too weary to resist. Mr Fu mis-timed his display of principle, defending a rules-based order that is being abandoned by its original designers, America first."

416,1,"W Chinese travellers to be different from them. The rise in the number of large tour groups in European cities has stoked fears of “overtourism” among locals. Chinese tourists’ supposed preference for only visiting popular landmarks, their taste for Chinese food and their addiction to luxury shopping are widely mocked. But the tastes of Chinese travellers are, in fact, rapidly converging with international norms—nowhere more so than on cruise ships.

America dominates the cruise industry. Carnival, Royal Carribean and Norwegian Cruise Line, which control nearly 80% of the global market between them, are based there. Just over half of the 26m people who went on a cruise in 2018 were American, reckons Cruise Market Watch, a data-provider. But China is catching up. Between 2013 and 2016 number of Chinese cruise-goers grew at a compound annual rate of 70%. In 2016 they overtook Germans to become the second-biggest cruise-going nation. Last year 2.4m Chinese holidayed on the high seas, spending around $3bn out of a global total of $46bn.

Now the industry is entering choppy waters in China, even as cruise passenger numbers increase almost everywhere else. Chinese passenger numbers dipped by 1-2% in 2018 and are estimated to fall by a further 5-15% this year. What happened?

Cruise lines owed their early success to offering Chinese tourists what they wanted: “floating shopping malls with casinos” in the words of David Beckel of Bernstein, a research firm. At sea they could bypass the country’s strict gambling laws (just as the original American “booze cruises” in the 1920s were a way of getting around Prohibition) and snap up duty-free Western brands. Shops on Royal Carribean and Carnival voyages were regularly stripped bare of everything from Bulgari necklaces to South Korean rice cookers.

No longer, it seems. Chinese tastes are fast becoming more sophisticated, observes Alex Dichter of McKinsey, a consultancy. Surveys suggest that visiting landmarks and shopping have been dethroned as top reasons for travelling. Nowadays taking a break from work to recharge and to experience local cultures tend to be the top of the list. The emphasis is on experiences, not things—like travellers in the West, in other words. Oliver Wyman, a consultancy, found that the share of Chinese holiday spending on shopping fell from 41% in 2016 to 32% by 2018.

As a result, cruise lines that have gone too native, or that rely too much on shopping for profits, have suffered. Norwegian launched its first ship built especially for China in 2017, armed with shops, gambling machines, Asian restaurants and a karaoke bar. Two years later, amid disappointing ticket sales, Norwegian spent $50m ripping out all the Chinese fripperies and moved the ship to Alaskan fjords. In 2018 Royal Caribbean scuttled SkySea Cruises, a joint venture with Ctrip, a Chinese online travel agency, when it discovered it could make more money running its own vessels with fewer nods to local taste. Carnival maintains its joint venture with , a state-owned Chinese firm. One reason might be to appease regulators keen to boost Chinese shipyards’ order books.

Royal Caribbean has found it more lucrative to offer a Western experience at sea at a premium price than to compete against cheap Chinese resorts. It is among the few lines in China that makes money, claims Richard Fain, its executive chairman. It is still adding more ships. On June 6th, after The Economist went to press, Spectrum of the Seas, its newest vessel, was due to embark on its maiden voyage from Shanghai carrying nearly 5,000 passengers.

Mr Fain thinks that the Chinese market will eventually rebound. Analysts at Goldman Sachs, a bank, reckon that just 0.5% of potential passengers in China took a cruise in 2017, compared with over 4% in America. Pierfrancesco Vago, executive chairman of Cruises, the world’s fourth-largest line, blames regulation. Western lines cannot sail between two Chinese ports. China is thinking about relaxing some of these rules, but only for domestic firms, which are few in number and tiny in size. To grow, they—and their regulators—may need to turn international."
417,1,"STERLING, Va. -- President Donald Trump on Sunday dangled the prospect of renewing his tariff threat against Mexico if the U.S. ally doesn't cooperate on border issues, while some of his Democratic challengers for the White House said the last-minute deal to avert trade penalties was overblown.

In a series of tweets, Trump defended the agreement heading off the 5% tax on all Mexican goods that he had threatened to impose Monday, but he warned Mexico that, ""if for some unknown reason"" cooperation fails, ""we can always go back to our previous, very profitable, position of Tariffs.""

Still, he said he didn't believe that would be necessary.

The tweets came amid questions about just how much of the deal — announced with great fanfare Friday — was really new. It included a commitment from Mexico, for instance, to deploy its new National Guard to its southern border with Guatemala. Mexico, however, had already intended to do that before Trump's latest threat and had made that clear to U.S. officials. Mexican officials have described their commitment as an accelerated deployment.

The U.S. also hailed Mexico's agreement to embrace the expansion of a program implemented earlier this year under which some asylum-seekers are returned to Mexico as they wait out their cases. But U.S. officials had already been working to expand the program, which has led to the return of about 10,000 people to Mexico, without Mexico's public embrace.

""The president has completely overblown what he reports to have achieved. These are agreements that Mexico had already made, in some cases months ago,"" said Democratic presidential candidate Beto O'Rourke, speaking on ABC's ""This Week."" ''They might have accelerated the time table, but by and large the president achieved nothing except to jeopardize the most important trading relationship that the United States of America has.""

Another 2020 candidate, Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, chastised Trump for using tariffs as a threat and operating a ""trade policy based on tweets.""

""I think what the world is tired of and what I am tired of is a president who consistently goes to war, verbal war with our allies, whether it is Mexico, whether it is Canada,"" he said.

But acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan, speaking on ""Fox News Sunday,"" insisted ""all of it is new,"" including the agreement to dispatch around 6,000 National Guard troops.

""This is the first time we've heard anything like this kind of number of law enforcement being deployed in Mexico to address migration, not just at the southern border but also on the transportation routes to the northern border and in coordinated patrols in key areas along our southwest border,"" he said, adding that ""people can disagree with the tactics"" but ""Mexico came to the table with real proposals"" that will be effective, if implemented.

Trump echoed the same in his tweets, insisting the deal was being misrepresented.

""We have been trying to get some of these Border Actions for a long time, as have other administrations, but were not able to get them, or get them in full, until our signed agreement with Mexico,"" he wrote. ""Mexico was not being cooperative on the Border in things we had, or didn't have, and now I have full confidence, especially after speaking to their President yesterday, that they will be very cooperative and want to get the job properly done.""

He also teased the idea that more was agreed to than was announced Friday, saying that ""some things"" and ""one in particular"" had been left out of the release but would be ""announced at the appropriate time.""

He could have been referring to discussion about Mexico becoming a ""safe third country,"" which would make it harder for asylum-seekers who pass through the country to claim refuge in the U.S. The idea, which Mexico has long opposed, was discussed during negotiations. But Mexican Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard has said Mexico did not agree to it.

Mexico's ambassador in Washington nonetheless said her country is committed to working with the U.S. and that discussions will continue.

""We want to continue to work with the U.S. very closely on the different challenges that we have together. And one urgent one at this moment is immigration,"" said Martha Barcena. She told CBS' ""Face the Nation"" that the countries' ""joint declaration of principles ... gives us the base for the road map that we have to follow in the incoming months on immigration and cooperation on asylum issues and development in Central America.""

She said the U.S. wants to see the number of migrants crossing the border return to levels seen in 2018."

419,1,"KHARTOUM (Reuters) - A campaign of civil disobedience to demand civilian rule left the streets of Sudan’s capital Khartoum largely deserted as the working week began on Sunday, while a 20-year-old man was shot dead in Omdurman, witnesses and opposition medics said.

Opposition and protest groups had called for workers to stay at home after security forces stormed a protest camp on Monday, killing dozens and dealing a blow to hopes of a peaceful transition after the overthrow of president Omar Hassan al-Bashir in April.

Transitional Military Council (TMC) spokesman Shams El Din Kabbashi said the council was willing to listen to the opposition’s demands and restart negotiations, which it halted after the attack on the camp.

After the raid, TMC head Abdel Fattah al-Burhan scrapped all agreements with the Declaration of Freedom and Change Forces (DFCF), an opposition alliance, and called for elections within nine months. The opposition rejected the plans.

The raid came after weeks of wrangling between the TMC, which took over from Bashir, and the DFCF over who should steer a transition leading to elections.

Protesters did take to the streets in several neighbourhoods of Khartoum on Sunday amid heavy security. Security forces fired shots into the air and used tear gas to disperse protesters in Khartoum North, witnesses said.

Elsewhere in the capital, few pedestrians or vehicles could be seen. Public transport was barely functioning and most commercial banks, private companies and markets were shut, though some state banks and public utility offices were open.

“We will not go back to work until the (opposition Sudanese Professionals’) Association announces the end of the strike,” said Ahmad al-Noor, a 46-year-old employee at a private food company. “Sudan must be governed by a civilian government.”

The SPA, which spearheaded the anti-Bashir protests, is part of the DFCF.

At Khartoum airport, where few flights were operating, travellers crowded the departure hall. Most travel agencies were closed because of an internet outage, and ticket prices soared.

However, the state news agency SUNA said the airport was “operating normally” and reported “complete attendance of employees in different airport units”.

Kabbashi told Sky News Arabia that “life has not been affected much by the disobedience declared today”.

But later on Sunday, the head of the TMC security committee told SUNA that the DFCF was responsible for “unfortunate events” that he said had been caused by “the irrational practices of the so-called neighbourhood resistance committees, which use children and force them to close roads and erect barricades in flagrant violation of the law”.

He said “organised groups paid by certain parties” had attacked police buildings and checkpoints, seeking to “obtain weapons and transfer their battles against the armed forces and the Rapid Support Forces into the capital and the big cities”.

He said the TMC would reinforce security to “restore normal life”, facilitate movement and guard strategic facilities.

In Omdurman, across the Nile from Khartoum, 20-year-old Ayman Osama died after being shot in the chest at a road barricade, the Central Committee of Sudanese Doctors said on social media, accusing a paramilitary force of killing him. The Rapid Support Forces (RSF) had no immediate comment.

Witnesses say the RSF led last Monday’s raid. Its troops have been heavily deployed in Khartoum, some with machine guns mounted on their pickup trucks.

The RSF grew out of the Arab Janjaweed militias accused of committing atrocities in Darfur during a civil war that began in 2003. Bashir’s government denied allegations that the militias had burned villages and raped and executed civilians.

State television reported that a senior commander of the RSF, whose leader General Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo is deputy head of the TMC, had been replaced.

Opposition medics put the death toll at 118 in the storming of the camp outside Khartoum’s Defence Ministry and subsequent security crackdown. The government has put the death toll at 61, including three members of the security services.

Also on Sunday, banking expert Mohamed Ahmed Bushra said he had turned down an offer from the TMC to become deputy governor of the central bank.

He told Reuters that current conditions and the failure to form a transitional civilian government made it difficult for the central bank to implement measures to address Sudan’s economic crisis."

I was in a narrow kitchen in Mumbai, one of India’s most strikingly modern cities, watching an ancient Indian meal being cooked on vessels of baked clay. Utensils made from leaves, wood and metal were scattered across the kitchen. The food was being prepared using only ingredients native to the subcontinent, which meant that the sharpness of chillies (native to Mexico) and the starch of the potatoes (imported from South America) were missing.

“No cabbages, cauliflower, peas or carrots, either,” said Kasturirangan Ramanujam, one of the cooks preparing the meal. But that won’t stop him from making an elaborate feast for my family that will include rice, the mulligatawny-like saatramudu, protein-rich kuzhambu gravy and an astonishing array of vegetables and snacks.

This is the shraadha meal that is eaten by many Hindu families in southern India on the death anniversaries of close family members – in this case, the anniversary of my father-in-law’s passing. While the feast is believed to feed families’ departed ancestors, it has inadvertently created a living memory of the region’s culinary history, because it is made entirely from recipes and ingredients that have existed on the subcontinent for at least a millennium.

In a country famous for its rich red curries made from tomatoes (introduced by the Portuguese) and the texture of its naan (from Central Asia), many of the most famous ingredients that go into typical ‘Indian’ food aren’t actually native to India.

Potatoes, tomatoes, cauliflower, carrots and peas, which are now staples in contemporary Indian cooking, arrived in the subcontinent relatively recently. Accounts from the late-18th Century report that the Dutch brought potatoes to India primarily to feed other Europeans. Now, however, potatoes are boiled, baked, roasted, stuffed and fried in nearly every kitchen in India.

The late Indian food historian K T Achaya believed that chillies probably arrived from Mexico via Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama and answered a deeply felt need for a pungent spice that could be grown in every part of the country without needing as much rain as pepper.

And according to Ruchi Srivastava, producer for Indian television show The Curries of India, “All cuisines in India have adopted the tomato.” The plant arrived in India through a circuitous route – from South America to southern Europe, then to England and finally to India in the 16th Century courtesy of the British. Srivastava argues that restaurants and hotels have popularised red curry sauce as ‘Indian’ in the last 100 years. “This has now started changing the palate of people,” she said. “For anyone who doesn’t know much about Indian food, the onion-tomato gravy has become a classic.”

However, the food eaten after the religious shraadha rite showcases the indigenous biodiversity of the Indian subcontinent. It’s a rich medley of unripe mangoes, raw bananas, cluster and broad beans, sweet potatoes, banana stems, taro roots and a succulent called pirandai (veld grape). These ingredients are flavoured with pepper, cumin and salt, while soft yellow mung dal provides much of the protein.

Throughout southern India, shraadhas are intensely private affairs involving only the immediate family. Before the feast, a codified ritual of prayers and offerings takes place. The meal is one of the most important events on the family’s calendar, and there could be a few shraadha meals each year performed by the family’s eldest male on the death anniversaries of immediate family members. It brings together a vast variety of delicacies designed to please the palates of their deceased ancestors.

“The traditional understanding is that when members of your family pass on, they become pitru devata [divine beings],” said Pazhaveri Chakravarti Raghavan, a senior Hindu priest in Mumbai. “It is believed that a whole year on Earth equals a single day for pitru devata, so the annual shraadha is their daily meal.”

Certain dishes – such as stir-fried bananas, saatramudu or kuzhambu – are often made at home. However, since the feast involves an elaborate preparation of vegetables, desserts and snacks, professional chefs are usually employed by those who can afford them. The cooks who prepare these meals often spend years in training. They also learn to customise the menu to reflect the local produce that was available when the family’s ancestor was alive.

“For example, if the family traces its roots to the Tondaimandalam [a historical region on India’s east coast], lady’s finger [okra, commonly grown in the region] is prepared,” Raghavan said.

Watching the chefs work quickly and efficiently, I realised that it could be hard to recognise these ancient dishes in India’s modern culinary climate. As foreign powers and traders have come and gone, Indian cooking has changed in the past 1,000 years. In many homes across the country, older dishes made with local ingredients that represent distinct subcultures now co-exist with imported influences from halfway across the globe. For instance, a South Indian meal may include rice with a light rasam (thin soup) made entirely from local ingredients like cumin, pepper and coriander seeds, but also include spicy stir-fried potatoes.

For this shraadha meal, Ramanujam was busy preparing five different vegetable-based dishes, using raw bananas, sweet potatoes, taro, cluster beans and bitter gourd procured from local markets. He seasoned them with a mixture of mustard seeds, cumin seeds, curry leaves and black gram beans, all lightly tossed in sesame oil.

“I will also prepare five bakshanam,” he said, referring to the fried snacks that will decorate the banana leaves on which the meal will be served. The desserts were sweetened with jaggery (a soft blend of processed and unbleached sugarcane juice) and made with coconut, black sesame seeds and coarsely ground wheat. Other snacks were salty and spicy, made from lentil paste and pepper. One of the meal’s centrepieces was the thirukannamudu: a milky sweet made with lentils and jaggery.

Because of the intimacy of the event, the shraadha meal is not something that most travellers ever see and taste themselves, but certain dishes served at the feast are available throughout southern India. For instance, adhirasam, an Indian-style doughnut that’s crunchy on the outside and soft and sweet on the inside, and thenkuzhal, a crispy and savoury snack made from rice and white lentil flour, are often available in snack shops. Many homes, temples and very traditional South Indian restaurants also serve at least a few heirloom dishes which also appear in private shraadha meals.

Srivasatava said that religious rituals like the shraadha meal are helping to maintain true Indian cuisine. “Home is the only place where food traditions are really preserved,” she said. While Indian food served at many restaurants rarely resembles what people eat at home, most home kitchens in India retain several traditional recipes passed down for generations. Even with newer ingredients, they maintain a balance of older spices, and reflect the nuances of their family’s traditional culinary subculture.

In fact, because shraadhas are typically much smaller and more intimate family affairs than other religious rituals, they have preserved culinary traditions much more effectively than larger family celebrations. “Weddings, for instance, are social occasions,” Raghavan said. “You have to cook a cosmopolitan meal, make it palatable to a large number of guests from different backgrounds. Shraadhas are more private. We can stick to tradition.”

Ramanujam worked together with a colleague, their fingers deftly mixing dollops of jaggery with rice flour and patting them down on a small piece of banana leaf. The flat discs were then skilfully deep-fried to become adhirasam doughnuts. Ramanujam added the adhirasam to a large bamboo basket lined with leaves, which was already filled with four other bakshanam.

“Traditionally, this meal was cooked on a wood fire,” Raghavan said. “Serving utensils were made of brass or silver. Nowadays, however, it is common to see stainless steel. A gas stove is also more convenient than a wood fire.”

The cooks sandwiched a thick dough of rice and black gram flour between a brass instrument made of two cylindrical units, and intricately shaped the fried thenkuzhal. Ramanujam turned his attention to the thin slivers of bitter gourd that were cooking with mung dal in clay pot. Another stove held a frying pan where taro discs were being deep-fried.

Elaborate as it was, the meal only incorporated a very small slice of India’s food diversity. Two thousand-year-old texts, like the Indian medicinal tome Charaka-samhita, have described a bewildering variety of oils, fruits, local grains, vegetables and animal products – many of which continue to be used in the country.

After the ritual was complete, the cooks placed a large serving of rice and a few spoonfuls of salted, boiled mung beans on a banana leaf for each person before adding the rest of the dishes. I looked at the rich delicacies on my leaf and felt grateful for this bounty, knowing that it was the work of generations of chefs who are preserving India’s living culinary history.

428,1,"(Reuters) - Greenpeace activists said on Sunday they halted the progress of an oil rig destined for BP Plc’s North Sea exploration program off the coast of Scotland.

The activists demanded that one of the world’s biggest energy companies immediately end drilling new wells and invest only in renewable energy or shut its operations and return cash to investors.

Greenpeace said in a statement that a team of activists in boats drew up besides the 27,000-tonne rig as it was trying to leave Cromarty Firth.

The statement quoted a Greenpeace activist from Scotland it identified as Jo as saying: “This rig and the 30 million barrels it seeks to drill, are a sure a sign that BP are committed to business as usual, fueling a climate emergency that threatens millions of lives and the future of the living world.”

BP said in a statement: “While we recognize the right for peaceful protest, the actions of this group are irresponsible and may put themselves and others unnecessarily at risk.”

The company said it was working with Transocean Ltd, the rig’s owner and operator, and other authorities to resolve the situation.

BP added that it shared the protesters’ concerns about climate and that it supported the Paris climate agreement.

Responding to BP’s statement, Greenpeace said that while the rig was owned by Transocean, it was on its way to the Vorlich field to drill new oil wells operated by BP.

Last month, Greenpeace activists blocked BP’s London headquarters in St James’ Square in central London, demanding the company end its oil exploration."

430,1,"Boeing has released concept footage of a high-speed Apache attack helicopter during the Vertical Flight Society’s 75th Annual Forum & Technology Display- and it looks awfully familiar.

Boeing's 'New' AH-64 Apache Attack Helicopter Might Just Be a 'Re-Run'

The new Block II Compound would increase aircraft speed to 185 kts, increase payload to 5,900 pounds hover-out of ground effect (HOGE) on takeoff, and increase the range to 460 nm.

Boeing has released concept footage of a high-speed Apache attack helicopter during the Vertical Flight Society’s 75th Annual Forum & Technology Display- and it looks awfully familiar.

Known as the Advanced AH-64 Block 2 Compound, the concept will serve as an interim solution in the U.S. Army Future Vertical Lift (FVL) program.

Interestingly enough, the high-tech mode doesn’t seem so high-tech, when one looks back at the AH-56 Cheyenne, which first flew in 1967.

Derived from the Army’s Advanced Aerial Fire Support System program, which ultimately ended in only ten being built.

Advanced before its time, the Cheyenne was an impressive helicopter that was limited only by the technology of the era.

While the AH-64 Apache technology partially came from the Cheyenne, the development has seemingly come full-circle. In addition to powerplant and control changes, the weapons “wings” and 30mm chain gun have also undergone changes.

With a rear-mounted pusher propeller, a large vertical fin and a new engine exhaust setup, the new Block 2 Compounds are rather futuristic.

According to Defence Blog, Boeing is dead set on keeping the Apache fleet “capable on the highly complex multi-domain battlefield of the future through 2060.”"

432,1,"Valentina Shevchenko made the first successful defense of her flyweight title with a thunderous knockout of Jessica Eye at UFC 238 on Saturday in Chicago.

Though she defeated Joanna Jedrzejczyk to win the belt, Shevchenko wanted badly to put a stamp on being the UFC champion with a successful defense against a streaking Eye.

The first round was all Shevchenko. Though Eye started strong, pressing Shevchenko with punches, she ate numerous hard kicks to the body.

Shevchenko eventually clinched with Eye and took her to the canvas where the fight remained for the better part of the opening frame. Shevchenko maintained top position for most of the remainder of the round, but mounted little damage on the canvas.

Having seen success with kicks to the body in the first round, Shevchenko continued her attacks to the body in round two, but only to set up the finishing blow.

That finishing blow came just 26 seconds into the second frame when Shevchenko’s kicks to the body were followed with one perfectly timed kick to the head. That head kick laid Eye flat on her back, arms flopped to her side, completely unconscious.

Shevchenko didn’t follow her opponent to the ground. She didn’t drop the hammer to make sure Eye was out. She didn’t need to. Eye was out cold.

With the precision of a cold-blooded assassin, Shevchenko landed the kill shot and simply walked away, calm as could be. She remained in her corner waiting for Eye to regain consciousness and then clapped as she did so a couple minutes later.

The victory marked Shevchenko’s third consecutive since returning to the flyweight division and was her first defense of the UFC flyweight title.

Though she mentioned wanting another shot at dual-division champion Amanda Nunes prior to UFC 238, Shevchenko said she now welcomes any challenger in the 125-pound rankings.

“All number tens, they are all very strong.”"
433,1,"But at the age of 22, the princess fell pregnant by a German merchant out of wedlock. It caused a scandal and - fearing for her life - she fled Zanzibar for a foreign land.

""Even in Germany [where she eventually fled] she challenged the popular perception of East Africa and the Orient,"" Mr El-Gheithy adds. ""She was a pioneer in terms of cross-cultural commentary and was the first woman to record her observations about the way of life in Germany and Zanzibar.""

""She was particularly concerned about young children suffering from cold and hunger in Europe, which at the time she had tried to alleviate.""

Born in 1844 in Zanzibar, an archipelago in the Indian Ocean now part of Tanzania, to Sultan Said Ibn Sultan Al Bu-Said and a Circassian [part of present-day Russia] courtesan, Salme was a rebel from the start.

Like most of her siblings, Salme sided with Barghash and became his general secretary. At the age of 15, she was writing letters to chiefs who had decided to follow her rebel brother.

Hanging out with the Europeans

The couple would occasionally leave Stone Town but were still visible enough to be seen. Several sightings of them were reported to the sultan by German companies.

When Sultan Majid heard about the rumours surrounding his sister and the German, he sent for Salme and had his executioner at the ready. The sultan was reportedly only calmed down by his stepmother who insisted that they wait and see if the rumours were true.

""Sayyida was a smart girl, she had heard of stories of girls in similar conditions who were sent on voyages but who only reached the bottom of the ocean,"" Mr El-Gheity says.

""I went down to the beach where Princess Salme was last seen when she left Zanzibar,"" Michael Bauer Ruete, the great-great grandson of Salme, tells the BBC. ""I took a bottle and filled it up with sand from the beach.""

He says: ""Although her life was not easy, [she] is still remembered and celebrated because of her strong character [and] the difficult decisions and sacrifices she had to make."""
434,1,"Four people have been killed on the first day of a strike, according to doctors aligned to the opposition.

Campaigners have called for ongoing civil disobedience from Sunday to make it as difficult as possible for the military to govern Sudan.

A number of Sudan's bank, airport and electricity workers were arrested ahead of the strike against the military rule, the main protest group said.

The Sudanese Professionals Association (SPA) said employees were also being threatened by the authorities to scare them into going to work instead of taking part in the nationwide strike.

What is the background?

The military took over Sudan after persistent protests led to the ousting of long-time President Omar al-Bashir in April. They promised a transition to civilian rule.

But pro-democracy campaigners say the military council cannot be trusted after Monday's crackdown against a sit-in demonstration in Khartoum - and they have rejected an offer of talks.

Most offices and businesses remain shut and traffic is light in the city, says the BBC's Catherine Byaruhanga in the Sudanese capital.

There have been reports of gunfire as security forces maintain their deployments across most parts of the city.

Protest leaders have asked people to stay at home. They say that demonstrations are no longer possible because of the violent crackdown by the military.

""The civil disobedience movement will begin Sunday and end only when a civilian government announces itself in power on state television,"" the SPA said in a statement.

What about the opposition arrests?

Their whereabouts are currently unknown, and analysts say the arrests suggest that Ethiopian mediation efforts have not been taken seriously by the military.

On Wednesday, the SPLM-N said its deputy head, Yasir Arman, was arrested at his house in Khartoum. He had returned from exile following the downfall of Mr Bashir.

Mr Esmat and Mr Jalab are both leading members of the Alliance for Freedom and Change, an umbrella organisation of opposition figures, protest leaders and rebel groups.

The TMC seems emboldened by the political and financial support it has received from Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Egypt, none of which are keen on fully fledged democracy, says BBC World Service Africa editor Mary Harper.

Opposition activists say a feared paramilitary unit, the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), killed 108 people in the crackdown, with at least 40 bodies pulled from the River Nile in Khartoum on Tuesday."
435,1,"WASHINGTON – President Donald Trump said Sunday that there's more to his deal with Mexico on tariffs and immigration than he announced two days ago, but he offered no specifics.

Trump tweeted that there were some things Mexico said it would do to curb Central American migration that were ""not mentioned"" in a description of the agreement put out by the State Department. He said those further steps would be ""announced at the appropriate time.""

When pressed in a television interview on whether Mexico agreed to further measures, Mexico's Ambassador to the United States Martha Bárcena said there were ""details"" that didn't make it in the official declaration.

Trump gave Mexico an ultimatum, demanding that it take stronger action to limit the flow of Central American migrants or he would impose an escalating series of tariffs on the country beginning Monday.

Friday, he said he was ""indefinitely"" suspending the threat because of an agreement reached with Mexico.

The New York Times reported Saturday that the steps outlined in the deal were ones Mexico had already agreed to in previous rounds of negotiations.

A crisis of Trump's own making?Critics say it's not clear how much Mexico deal will accomplish

Trump pulls tariff threat: Says deal on migrants reached with Mexico

The administration said Mexico agreed to take ""unprecedented steps to increase enforcement"" along its southern border with Guatemala, where many Central Americans cross into Mexico on their way to the USA. Mexico said it would crack down on human smuggling organizations.

When asked about Trump's tweet on CBS' ""Face the Nation,"" Bárcena said only that there were ""details that we discussed during the negotiations and during the conversations that we didn't put in the declaration.""

Saturday morning, Trump tweeted that Mexico reached a deal with the United States to purchase American agricultural goods as part of a larger deal to avoid the imposition of tariffs on Mexican goods.

Asked on ""Face the Nation"" whether there was a new agricultural deal, Bárcena brought up the United States-Mexico-Canada trade agreement signed last November, saying it would lead to a dramatic increase in trade.

She insisted on Twitter that she ""did not contradict"" Trump.

""I just explained that with no tariffs and the USMCA ratification the trade in agricultural products will increase dramatically,"" Bárcena said.

Republican lawmakers praised Trump's strategy on pressing Mexico, even though many oppose tariffs. On ""Fox News Sunday,"" Wisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson, chairman of the Homeland Security Committee, called Trump's actions ""brilliant"" when asked whether Republican senators would stand up against tariffs.

He said the migrant crisis was ""out of control"" so Trump ""had to act.""

Congressional Democrats called the dispute over tariffs a crisis of Trump's own making.

Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer of New York wrote on Twitter that ""if past is prologue, this is likely to be one of the president’s typical, bogus solutions to justify backing off things like the tariffs.""

""Threats and temper tantrums are no way to negotiate foreign policy,"" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said in a statement released Saturday."
436,1,"(Reuters) - United Technologies Corp agreed on Sunday to combine its aerospace business with U.S. contractor Raytheon Co and create a new company worth about $121 billion (£95 billion), in what would be the sector’s biggest ever merger.

The deal would reshape the competitive landscape by forming a conglomerate which spans commercial aviation and defence procurement. United Technologies provides primarily commercial plane makers with electronics, communications and other equipment, whereas Raytheon mainly supplies the U.S. government with military aircraft and missile equipment.

While United Technologies and Raytheon have some common customers, their business overlap is limited, an argument the companies plan to make once U.S. antitrust regulators start scrutinizing the merger.

However, the two major commercial aircraft makers, Boeing Co and Airbus SE, as well as the Pentagon, have been known to use their significant purchasing power to seek concessions from their suppliers and may not welcome a potential lessening in competition among them.

When United Technologies rebuffed an acquisition offer from Honeywell International Inc in 2016, United Technologies chief executive Greg Hayes justified the decision partly by predicting that Boeing and Airbus would never accept having a supplier that would “build the plane from tip to tail.”

United Technologies has said it is on track to separate its Carrier air conditioning and Otis elevator businesses, leaving the company focused on its aerospace business through its $23 billion acquisition of Rockwell Collins, which was completed in 2018, and the Pratt & Whitney engines business.

Chinese authorities scrutinized the acquisition of airplane parts maker Rockwell Collins closely, given the companies’ footprint in that country’s market. This resulted in the deal closing in November 2018, as opposed to the targeted third quarter.

Trade tensions between the United States and China were blamed at least partly by analysts for that delay, but a source close to the deal said the companies did not expect this to be repeated because Raytheon does not do business in China.

Under the deal announced on Sunday, Raytheon shareholders will receive 2.3348 shares in the combined company for each Raytheon share. The merger is expected to result in more than $1 billion in cost synergies by the end of the fourth year, the companies said.

United Technologies shareholders will own about 57% of the combined business, called Raytheon Technologies Corporation, which will be led by Hayes. Raytheon shareholders will own the remaining stake, and Raytheon CEO Tom Kennedy will be named executive chairman. The companies negotiated the terms over several months, according to the source, who requested anonymity discussing the confidential deliberations.

The deal has been structured so that no shareholder of either company will receive a premium. United Technologies and Raytheon have market capitalizations of $114 billion and $52 billion, respectively.

The deal is expected to close in the first half of 2020.

The newly created company is expected to return between $18 billion and $20 billion of capital to shareholders in the first three years after the deal’s completion, the companies said. The new company will also assume about $26 billion in net debt, they added.

Raytheon, maker of the Tomahawk and the Patriot missile systems, and other U.S. military contractors are expected to benefit from strong global demand for fighter jets and munitions as well as higher U.S. defence spending in fiscal 2020, much of it driven by U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration.

However, Pentagon spending is projected to slow down after an initial boost under Trump. A deal with United Technologies would allow Raytheon to expand into commercial aviation.

Conversely, United Technologies could benefit from reducing its exposure to commercial aerospace clients amid concerns that the rise of international trade protectionism will suppress economic growth and weigh on the flow of goods through air traffic.

The International Air Transport Association, which represents about 290 carriers accounting for more than 80% of global air traffic, cited these concerns earlier this month, when it said the industry is expected to post a $28 billion profit in 2019, down from a December forecast of $35.5 billion.

The deal with Raytheon could put pressure on General Electric Co, which competes with United Technologies for commercial aerospace clients, to seek scale. It could also push other defence contractors, such as Lockheed Martin Corp, to explore expanding their commercial businesses.

Last year, military communication equipment providers Harris Corp and L3 Technologies Inc announced an all-stock merger that, once completed, will create the sixth-largest U.S. defence contractor.

Morgan Stanley, Evercore Inc and Goldman Sachs Group Inc were financial advisers to United Technologies, while Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz was its legal adviser. Citigroup Inc was financial adviser to Raytheon, and RBC Capital Markets LLC provided a fairness opinion. Shearman & Sterling LLP was legal adviser to Raytheon."

440,1,"Take a look at the headline at the top of this article.

Did you spot the misplaced apostrophe? If you didn't, don't worry, you're in good company: Taylor Swift has been named and shamed on social media for mis-punctuating one of her T-shirts.

Quoting the lyrics to her new song, ME!, the shirt declares: ""Your'e the only one of you.""

Swift's mistake is all the more delicious because, elsewhere on the single, she sings: ""Hey kids, spelling is fun!"" (Fun fact: Swift once won her elementary school's spelling bee contest.)

But she's not the first pop star to slip up on the icy path of good grammar.

Last year, Cheryl made a similar punctuation error on a hoodie featuring lyrics from her single Love Made Me Do It (""it was'nt my fault""), while One Direction sold T-shirts for their 2012 Australian tour listing a concert on ""21th June"".

Justin Bieber also recalled a garment for his 2016 Purpose tour after fans pointed out he'd invented the new word ""purose"".

Mistakes are ""not common but not unprecedented,"" says Henry Oliver, editor of New Zealand's Metro magazine and co-author of The Art Of The Band T-Shirt.

""Getting the names of cities wrong is the most common mistake - but once you've left for tour, and you've got boxes of T-shirts, the error seems to stick.""

There's a reluctance to scrap mis-printed merchandise because of the cost involved. A run of 1,000 T-shirts costs about £2,500; and major artists will print many more for a world tour.

Added to which, ""there's been a general shift towards merchandise as a revenue generator since the decline of record sales over the last 15, 20 years,"" says Oliver.

According to the Licensing International, the global music merchandise market was worth $3.5 billion (£2.75 billion) in 2018, up from $2.3 billion (£1.8 billion) four years ago.

To put that in perspective, revenue from live music concerts worldwide last year was $5.65 billion (£4.44 billion); while the global market for recorded music was worth $19.1 billion (£15.04 billion), according to the IFPI.

So merchandise is a vital source of income - and artists are finding new ways to exploit its potential.

""Over the last five years, there's been a new emphasis band merchandise as street wear and fashion,"" says Oliver.

""So, for example, Harry Styles came to play recently in Auckland, and there was the opportunity to go and buy merchandise the day before the show.

""That seems to be an increasingly regular occurrence, whereby artists will come and have pop-up shops that will almost be selling a clothing line. It's more akin to fashion than traditional concert merchandise.""

Kanye West, who takes fashion as seriously as music, helped pioneer the trend, launching his Yeezy collections with lavish shows at New York Fashion Week.

Notably, his designs sell at much higher prices than the average £20 tour T-shirt, a trend that's been followed by Justin Bieber and David Bowie - whose Paul Smith-designed Blackstar shirts went for £65 each.

Taylor Swift charges more fan-friendly prices for her merchandise - but that wandering apostrophe could bump up the cost of her tour Ts for collectors.

Misprints and mistakes are particularly interesting to ""hyper-completists"", says Brent Greissle, the discography specialist at music trading website Discogs.com.

People will pay high prices for a rare pressing The Beatles' 1970 compilation album Hey Jude, where song titles are erroneously listed as ""Paper Back Writer"" and ""Revolutions"" (instead of Paperback Writer and Revolution, respectively).

Collectors will also pay upwards of £500 for a vinyl pressing of Rubber Soul where the label lists the geographically-challenged Lennon-McCartney composition ""Norweigian Wood"".

""Especially with those examples, it's something of a big price difference for incredibly minor things like slight spelling errors,"" says Greissle - whose favourite mis-prints are on bootleg records like ""Sexperience The Hendrix"" and the timeless ""Best Of Eric Crapton"".

He says fans of artists like the Beatles, David Bowie, Led Zeppelin and U2 are more likely to seek out these rarities - but ""for the most part, the difference between an error copy and a regular copy may be negligible at best.

""Rest assured, the number of people who would care about a typo on an Andy Williams or Mantovani pop record are far less than the supply.""

Fans have indicated that only a handful of Taylor Swift's already limited-edition T-shirts contained the grammatical error, in which case, ""she has definitely created something very sought-after,"" says Oliver.

""You could imagine a situation where these are selling for hundreds of pounds on eBay.""

And he argues the star could turn the error into an opportunity.

""We're in an era where, unless you're talking about political mis-statements, any mistake can be owned in a way that gives it ironic value to your fanbase.

""So for someone like Taylor Swift, who is so good at internalising and capitalising on critiques of herself, there's almost no mistake she couldn't turn to her own advantage.

""Let's say next week there was a news story whereby some fan had paid a ridiculous amount of money for one of those T-shirts. My natural inclination would be to be cynical about that story,"" he says, suggesting Swift's team could turn the misprint into a marketing opportunity.

In many ways, that's already happened: People are Instagramming and Tweeting (and writing news stories, natch) about a garment that otherwise would have been noticed only by hardcore Swifties.

So if you notice an upsurge in pop-based splling mistakes in the cmoing weeks, now you kno why.

441,1,"CIUDAD DE MÉXICO, 27 ago (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Los creadores de una serie documental sobre la trata de personas en México esperan que el programa de televisión sirva para informar al público abiertamente sobre el abuso sufrido por los trabajadores, ya sean personas encargadas de la limpieza o trabajadores rurales."
442,1,"This blog post by 60 Minutes' Kevin Livelli, one of the producers who reported on rare earth elements this week, was originally published on March 22, 2015:

Not long ago, if you had stopped me on the street and told me there was an interesting 60 Minutes story to be told about the lanthanide series of rare earth elements, I would have said you're crazy.

To begin with, who's ever heard of them? And even if you did manage to find them on that obscure bottom rung of the Periodic Table, you'd hit another hurdle -- how to pronounce them. They have names only Dr. Seuss might have dreamt up. There's terbium, dysprosium, ytterbium, and lutetium. Neodymium, europium, cerium, and lanthanum. Not exactly the kind of thing that rolls off the tongue.

""...perhaps a little dose of pop culture might spark the imagination. After all, China's hold on rare earth elements is a running theme in 'House of Cards'...""

In this case, I stumbled on rare earths by accident. While doing some other reporting, I found that they were on the mind of former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper. In 2013, he mentioned them in congressional testimony, as part of an annual ""Worldwide Threat Assessment"" -- a litany of threats to national security.

Clapper told Congress that rare earths are ""essential"" to the 21st century global economy, including the burgeoning green tech industry, and he emphasized that they are ""critical"" to advanced defense systems. That was intriguing, I thought. But there was more. One country -- China -- has been holding a ""commanding monopoly"" over world supply, at the time about 95 percent of the market, and things weren't going to change soon.

The light bulb went off. Here was something that touched people's lives not just in their everyday use (televisions, smartphones, tablets, computers, stereos, cars), but also had implications for U.S. energy security (hybrids, wind turbines, energy efficient lighting) and national security as well (precision-guided missiles, radar, night-vision goggles, lasers, satellites, fighter jets, submarines).

A little more digging revealed that the U.S. had actually once led the world in the rare earth industry and pioneered many of its common applications before ceding that dominance to China. I wanted to know how that happened and what it all meant. Here were good questions for our 60 Minutes story. My colleague, Graham Messick, and I set out to find the answers.

In doing so, we quickly found reporting on rare earths to be especially challenging. To begin with, we had to learn how rare earths are different from other metals and minerals -- like iron or copper. What makes them rare? Turns out, as Lesley Stahl explains in our story, the name is a bit of a misnomer. Rare earths occur naturally in lots of places, but only a few have concentrations high enough to mine. You might think, then, that if the U.S. had more rare earth mines, the problem would be solved. You'd be wrong.

Even if you were to luck out and find a mine like the one owned by Molycorp out in Mountain Pass, California and get it up and running, your work isn't finished. Unlike other metals, rare earths don't go to market in raw form. They have to be separated from one another and many are turned into metals first, which means they must be processed to exact specifications (sometimes up to several ""9s"" as in 99.9999 percent purity) that take into consideration their intended end use. And that is very hard to do. So to be successful in the rare earth business, you need to have not just access to the right rocks, but also access to the right know-how that will allow you to turn those rocks into something useful. That complex combination is what makes them ""rare.""

Another challenge in reporting on rare earths is understanding the supply chain. Rare earths feed the high tech industry around the world, and supply chains from mine to manufacturer can include as many as 12 stops along the way. So, for example, if you were to follow the dozen or so different rare earths metals that experts say are in each iPhone all the way back to the mine, you'd have an extremely hard time doing so. Same goes for the rare earths used in the F-35. The lengthy supply chains get very complicated very quickly.

What's more, lasting success in the rare earth industry, I learned, only comes when the supply chain companies choose to operate close to the source of rare earths and cultivate a symbiotic relationship. Today, China is on top not only because it has the biggest mine and the most know-how, but also as a result of having drawn manufacturers from around the world that use rare earths (i.e. supply chain customers) to Asia.

To help us understand how rare earths impact our lives and to show us where they can actually be found inside our gadgets, we interviewed Ed Richardson, the president of the U.S. Magnetic Materials Association, a trade group that represents American rare earth magnet makers.

In the video player above, you'll see that Richardson came to the interview with what looked at first to be a bunch of electronic junk. It turns out it really was his old stuff - an old cell phone, ear buds, and a toy helicopter -- but then we watched him dissect each object to reveal the rare earth magnets inside.

Along the way, he taught us a few other cool facts about rare earths. For instance, they can hold a thousand times their own weight, and they are a key technology behind the miniaturization of modern gadgets, enabling them to be smaller and lighter.

If, after watching our 60 Minutes story, you still think rare earths bring up too many bad high school chemistry memories, perhaps a little dose of pop culture might spark the imagination.

After all, China's hold on rare earth elements was a running theme in ""House of Cards"" (think of Raymond Tusk's push for ""Samarium 149""). And Jason Bourne's mission in The Bourne Dominion is defending the only U.S. rare earth mine. There's even a way, if you like to take matters into your own hands, to fight for global control of the rare earth supply in the video game ""Call of Duty: Black Ops II."" 

 

I guess the Periodic Table isn't so boring after all."
444,1,"More than 16,000 people have participated in our project to collect and analyze political ads on the social media platform during the midterm elections this year.

Since we launched our Facebook Political Ad Collector project in fall 2017, more than 16,000 people have participated in it. They all agreed to install a browser plug-in that anonymously sent us the ads they see when they browse Facebook. We used that data to understand and report on how political messaging on Facebook works, and how the system is being gamed to manipulate the public discourse.

Although the number of users is large, over the summer we noticed a potential snag: We were receiving more ads from Democrats and progressive groups than from Republicans or conservative groups. Our hunch was that this was because we had more liberal participants than conservatives ones.

We tried a number of things to make our ad collection more diverse: to start, we bought our own Facebook ads asking people across a range of states to install the ad collector. We also teamed up with Mozilla, maker of the Firefox web browser, for a special election-oriented project, in an attempt to reach a broader swath of users.

But because we made the Political Ad Collector almost completely anonymous, we couldn’t say much definitively about the audience. We also couldn’t know for sure how much of the skew in our findings was because of the people who participated in the project and how much of it was because left-leaning groups used Facebook advertising more than (or differently than) conservative groups.

To dig deeper, we partnered with some academic researchers and a research firm called YouGov to create a panel of users from across a wide spectrum of demographic groups and political ideologies who would agree to use a special version of the ad collector plug-in that was less anonymous. For these users, we had a unique ID that was tied back to data about them provided to us by YouGov — demographics, political leaning, race, state of residence, but not name or address.

This collaboration was suggested, and funded, by the Democracy Fund.

YouGov paid members of this new group to install a special version of the Political Ad Collector browser plug-in. We were able to link their answers to demographic questions — like age and partisanship — to the ads that they sent us. Through this survey, 3,588 participants submitted at least five ads from Oct. 15 until the election. The group was designed to yield a large and diverse enough sample that will let us, and academic researchers who study political ads, make statistically valid claims about the ads people see.

We didn’t change anything about the way we collect data from users of the original, publicly available ad collector plug-in who were not participating in the YouGov survey. They remain anonymous to us, and we collected absolutely no personal information from them.

Ads that were seen by participants in the YouGov survey, with the demographic data stripped, are part of our existing database of ads. We aren’t publishing the survey-derived data, though we have shared it with some academic researchers.

Now that we’ve got a better sample that can help us draw broad conclusions about Facebook political ads, here’s some of what we’ve learned from the project:

Perhaps unsurprisingly, more than 70 percent of all the political ads we saw were highly targeted by ideology. Most ads were shown to at least twice as many people from one side of the political spectrum than the other. Only about 18 percent of political ads were seen by anything close to an even ratio of liberals and conservatives.

One advertiser that targeted both sides was AARP, which spent about $700,000 on ads from May to the election. Many of those ads simply urged viewers to vote; some ads encouraged people to hold their member of Congress accountable for voting yes on “last year’s bad health care bills.” The AARP has opposed efforts to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act.

“AARP has a long history of nonpartisan voter engagement,” an AARP spokesperson said in a statement. “Our goal was to engage our members, whose views span the ideological spectrum. These facts guided our strategy.”

The ad that was seen by the most people in the YouGov sample was this one from Tom Steyer’s “Need to Impeach” organization, which included a video saying, “We need to impeach Donald Trump before he does more damage,” citing “legally segregated camps” for migrant children and Hurricane Maria deaths. The ad was seen almost exclusively by self-identified liberals in our sample. According to Facebook, Steyer has spent $2.3 million on Facebook ads between May and Election Day. (Steyer and his wife, Kat Taylor, are donors to ProPublica, and Taylor is on our board.)

But because the Facebook advertising system makes it easy to show ads to very small target audiences, a relatively small number of participants in our project saw the “Need to Impeach” ad. Of the 3,588 people who submitted at least five ads from Oct. 15 until Election Day, only 146 saw it.

That microtargeting may help explain why, even with a pretty large number of participants, and including all these additional participants who better represent the country, we still didn’t see any ads or advertisers caught up in investigations and news stories about foreign election meddling. We did, however, report on a mysterious Facebook page called “America Progress Now” urging liberals to vote for Green Party candidates. The candidates themselves had never heard of the group, and we couldn’t find any address or legal registration for it.

We also saw ads from liberal groups that used misleading tactics we first saw being employed in 2016 by groups like the Internet Research Agency in Russia. “Voter Awareness Project” urged conservatives not to vote to re-elect Ted Cruz, the Texas Republican senator, citing Trump’s previous antagonism toward him. But the group was actually run by a prominent liberal. And other liberals, like Ohio gubernatorial candidate Rich Cordray and the Environmental Defense Action Fund, ran political ads from pages with names that implied they were news organizations, like “Ohio Newswire” and “Breaking News Texas.”

We also found a fair number of political ads that Facebook didn’t label as political as part of their new system, including clearly political ones from Sen. Kamala Harris, Uber, Alliance Defending Freedom and others.

We still have some unanswered questions about how advertising works on Facebook, including some that go beyond political ads:

While we found a way to determine, in part, how an ad is targeted, there are complexities to Facebook’s systems that we can’t detect or understand. For instance, what is the impact of the algorithm Facebook uses to show ads to whoever is mostly likely to click? Upturn, a think tank that researches equity issues in the design and governance of technology, says in a court filing that they ran a job ad for a bus driver and, on its own, Facebook showed this ad to four times as many men as women.

Advertisers pay Facebook more for their ads to be seen by some kinds of people than by others — based on, for example, age, demographics and median income. What’s the effect of some people seeing on average more expensive ads than others? How big is the disparity? Whose attention is cheap, and whose is expensive? How do cheap ads differ from more expensive ones?

Facebook has a “lookalike audience” ad-targeting feature, which lets advertisers target people who are “similar to” their page’s visitors or personal contact info they upload. Could this be a sneaky (or even unintentional) way to target a housing or job ad in a discriminatory way?

Facebook classifies individual users by their political beliefs and their “multicultural affinity,” letting advertisers show ads just to, for instance, people who are “very conservative” or who have “Multicultural affinity: African American (US).” How accurate are Facebook’s guesses? You can see political ads targeted by multicultural affinity here: African-American, Asian-American, Hispanic - All, Hispanic - English Dominant, Hispanic - Spanish Dominant, Hispanic - Bilingual.

451,1,"TOKYO (Reuters) - Miyako Shirakawa was a 19-year-old college student when she was raped by an older man. She said that when the attack started, her mind went blank and she froze up.

“When I became aware, he was on top of me,” said Shirakawa, 54, now a psychiatrist who treats sexual abuse victims.

That type of response “is a common, instinctive reaction - it’s a form of psychological self-protection,” added Shirakawa, who became pregnant because of the rape, which she didn’t report to police, and had an abortion.

But under Japanese law, not fighting back can make it impossible for prosecutors to prove rape.

Legislators revised Japan’s century-old rape law in 2017 to include harsher penalties and other changes. The reforms, however, left intact controversial requirements that prosecutors must prove that violence or intimidation was involved or that the victim was “incapable of resistance.”

A recent series of acquittals has revived outrage over that legal standard, which Shirakawa and other critics say places an unfairly high burden on victims, deterring them from coming forward and hurting their chances in court if they do.

They say the law must be revisited to make all non-consensual sex a crime, without exception, as it is in other developed countries such as Britain, Germany and Canada.

“Discussing sexual violence from the victim’s viewpoint is a world trend, and it’s time to reform the Japanese legal system and society that cannot do that,” said Minori Kitahara, an author and activist who is among the organisers of protests against the recent rulings.

One such ruling came in March, when a court in Nagoya, central Japan, acquitted a father accused of raping his 19-year-old daughter.

According to a copy of the verdict seen by Reuters, the court recognised that the sex was non-consensual, that the father had physically and sexually abused the victim when she was younger and that he had used force. But the judges concluded that doubt remained as to whether she had no option other than to submit. The case is under appeal.

“The verdict was extremely strict about proving psychological incapacity to resist,” said Tomoko Murata, a lawyer who handles sexual assault cases.

Activists are holding monthly demonstrations in which participants grasp flowers as a symbol of protest.

“The media are reporting about the verdicts and the protests. The increase in the number of people who think that this situation is wrong will give strength to those who cannot speak of their own suffering,” Jun Yamamoto, head of sexual assault victims group Spring and a victim herself, told Reuters.

In May, Spring presented the justice ministry and Supreme Court with demands for legal reforms.

The #MeToo movement has been mostly subdued in Japan, and only 2.8 percent of sexual assault victims tell police, often for fear of being blamed themselves and publicly shamed.

Many tell no one at all. A 2017 report by the government’s gender equality bureau showed nearly 60 percent of female victims of forced sex kept it to themselves.

“My patients are afraid, and there are many who feel it is impossible to make a legal case, so all they can do is cry themselves to sleep,” Shirakawa said.

Murata said the acquittals would further discourage victims from seeking help from the legal system.

“In dealing with police, prosecutors and courts, the law is so strict and a guilty verdict so difficult that the victim begins to suffer,” she said. “The repercussions of such verdicts are huge.”

Behind the legal burden, experts say, is a traditional view that women are responsible for protecting their chastity. Japan’s rape law was introduced before women could vote and its main intent was to protect family honour and pedigree, legal experts say.

“The idea is women must resist to the very limit. That is at the heart of this kind of ruling,” Murata said. “And there is still the view that ‘No means Yes.’ It is not yet the common view that a woman’s agreement is necessary before having sex.”

The 2017 reforms widened the definition of “forced sexual intercourse” to include anal and oral sex, thus including men as victims; lengthened the minimum prison sentence to five years from three; and enabled prosecution even if the victim did not press charges.

It also dropped the requirement that rape of a person under the age of 18 by a parent or guardian must involve violence, intimidation or incapacity to resist to be considered a crime.

Proposals to do the same for adults failed partly because of concerns that doing so would lead to an increase in false charges. Critics say there’s no evidence that is true - the social, psychological and legal barriers to prosecuting a case are too high.

“Proof the sex was non-consensual would still be required, so I don’t think false charges would increase,” Murata said.

Justice Minister Takashi Yamashita, asked about the calls for reforms, told a parliamentary panel last month that his ministry would assess the current situation and consider what action to take. But he gave no deadline for a decision.

“We must cautiously consider the impact of completely removing the requirement (to prove) violence or intimidation,” he said in reply to questions from an opposition lawmaker.

When reforms were enacted in 2017, parliament called for a review after three years, and activists hope the public outrage will bolster pressure for additional changes.

Some members of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s ruling Liberal Democratic Party are taking an interest in the topic, forming a group called “Caucus for a Society Without Sexual Violence.”

“I felt that the verdicts were unbelievable, impossible,” Chihiro Ito, 29, a victim of attempted rape who is a member of Spring, told Reuters.

“But there are also positive aspects for Spring. The view of ordinary people, the decent reaction that in common sense terms, these verdicts are wrong is spreading in society,” she said. “It would be good if that triggers debate in society and leads to reform.”"

454,1,"S and “transformative”. The description could apply both to the proposed merger between Fiat Chrysler Automobiles ( ) and Renault announced on May 27th and its demise only ten days later. Late in the evening of June 5th the Italian-American firm, which had approached its French counterpart with the offer, announced that it was withdrawing the proposal. The share prices of both companies fell on the news. The rapid implosion of a deal that was intended to secure the futures of both carmakers as the industry undergoes fundamental change is a huge blow for its architects. It shows that the much-needed consolidation of the car industry will be fiendishly hard to pull off.

The deal looked like a winner for both parties. Their complementary strengths in regions and products, plus a chance to share investment in electrification and self-driving cars, had convinced John Elkann, the chairman of (who sits on the board of The Economist’s parent company), and Jean-Dominique Senard, his counterpart at Renault, of the wisdom of combining the two firms. This would create the world’s third-biggest carmaker. If Renault’s Japanese partners, Nissan and Mitsubishi, got on board, the firm would become a colossus making 15m cars a year—almost half as much again as their closest competitors.

So what went so wrong, so quickly, to compel to pull out? The deal, born out of reportedly convivial talks between Mr Elkann and Mr Senard, was greeted with approval by investors. The French government, which has a 15% stake in Renault, seemed amenable. Nissan, Renault’s main alliance partner in which the French firm has a 43% stake, made reassuring noises.

But, it then emerged, Nissan had been kept in the dark about the deal until the last minute. It worried that the deal’s structure as a 50-50 partnership between shareholders of Renault and did not properly acknowledge Renault’s stake in Nissan, worth some $13bn. And the Japanese firm felt rushed into making a huge strategic decision, not long after it had rejected Renault’s plan for a full merger under Carlos Ghosn, the firm’s former boss who is now fighting charges of financial wrongdoing at Nissan (which he denies). Under the terms of the agreement governing the alliance, a change of control would have allowed Nissan to renegotiate the partnership. It had apparently called for a strategic review. The cost savings of €5bn ($6bn) that claimed for the deal were partly predicated on the continuation of Renault’s alliance with Nissan and Mitsubishi.

Despite its misgivings, Nissan could have been brought on board, believed. For the main stumbling-block was the French government, which has a habit of being a tricky counterparty in deals involving national champions. Without French support, and acceptance of a 7.5% stake in the merged firm, the deal would not have got this far. But the French wanted control. Sources close to say that the government was constantly second-guessing and renegotiating every aspect of the deal. For this portended future interference. When France pointed the finger at Nissan as a roadblock, lost patience.

The question is what happens now? Yet another car-industry mega-merger has collapsed—this time before it even got off the ground. It seems unlikely that the deal can be revived. ’s disillusionment with the French government seems too great. The rocky relationship between Renault and Nissan is unlikely to be improved by the French government’s finger-wagging. will lick its wounds and may seek another deal. One often mooted partner is Group, the maker of Peugeots and Citroëns. But it was the damning verdict on the now-dead merger issued last week by ’s boss, Carlos Tavares, who called it a “virtual takeover” of Renault, that may have thrown a spanner in the works. Engineering the consolidation of the car industry is looking harder than ever."
455,1,"(Reuters) - O secretário do Tesouro dos Estados Unidos, Steven Mnuchin, disse neste domingo que o presidente Donald Trump pode aliviar restrições dos EUA à Huawei se houver progresso na disputa comercial com a China - mas, sem um acordo, Washington manteria tarifas para reduzir seu déficit.

“Acho que o que o presidente está dizendo é que, se avançarmos no comércio, talvez ele esteja disposto a fazer certas coisas sobre a Huawei, se ele tiver conforto da China sobre isso e algumas garantias”, disse Mnuchin. “Mas estas são questões de segurança nacional.”

Washington impôs e depois endureceu tarifas de importação sobre produtos chineses em uma tentativa de reduzir o déficit comercial dos EUA e combater o que chama de práticas comerciais desleais.

O governo dos EUA também acusou a gigante de telecomunicações chinesa de espionagem e roubo de propriedade intelectual, alegações que a Huawei Technologies, uma fornecedora líder na tecnologia de próxima geração 5G, nega.

Washington colocou a Huawei em uma lista negra que efetivamente proíbe empresas americanas de fazer negócios com a empresa, e pressionou seus aliados a também bloquear a Huawei, argumentando que a companhia poderia usar sua tecnologia para realizar espionagem para Pequim.

Mnuchin disse que os Estados Unidos estavam preparados para chegar a um acordo com a China, mas também para manter as tarifas, se necessário.

“Se a China quiser avançar com o acordo, estamos preparados para avançar nos termos que fizemos. Se a China não quiser avançar, então o presidente Trump está perfeitamente feliz em avançar com as tarifas para reequilibrar o relacionamento”, disse Mnuchin.

Comentando sobre um acordo de imigração entre o México e os Estados Unidos, Mnuchin disse acreditar que o México cumprirá seus compromissos, mas acrescentou que Trump “reserva-se o direito” de impor tarifas se os compromissos não forem cumpridos.

O próprio Trump publicou no Twitter no sábado que “o México vai se esforçar muito e, se eles fizerem isso, esse será um acordo muito bem-sucedido entre os Estados Unidos e o México”."
456,1,"LONDON (Reuters) - Qatar said on Sunday that there was a disconnect between the Palestinians and the United States over a U.S. blueprint aimed at ending the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians, warning that a solution could not be imposed on Palestinians.

The U.S. blueprint, driven by Jared Kushner, Donald Trump’s son-in-law and White House adviser, is seen by Palestinians, and by some Arab officials and politicians, as a plan to finish off the Palestinian cause.

“As far as we see, right now there is a disconnect between the Palestinians and the U.S.,” Qatar Foreign Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman al-Thani said told reporters in London.

“Our position remains very firm: We are going to support any plan that the Palestinians are willing to accept.”

Kushner, who has been trying to put together a peace plan, said in an interview broadcast last week that the Palestinians deserve “self-determination”, but stopped short of backing Palestinian statehood and expressed uncertainty over their ability to govern themselves.

While its precise outlines have yet to be revealed, Palestinian and Arab sources who have been briefed on the draft plan say Kushner has jettisoned the two-state solution - the long-standing U.S. and international formula that envisages an independent Palestinian state alongside Israel in the West Bank, east Jerusalem and Gaza.

“It cannot be a solution like, sort of, imposed on the Palestinians – no country in the Arab world can accept that,” Sheikh Mohammed said.

“If the plan is rejected by one of the parties it means the plan is either unfair or just not realistic,” he said. “The best scenario is either that both parties accept it or that both parties reject it.”

Sheikh Mohammed said there would not be a pledging conference. He praised the economic part of the Kushner plan as being “wonderful” but said it needed a sound political foundation."
457,1,"Chisinau (AFP) - Moldova plunged deeper into crisis Sunday as a new, acting president dissolved parliament and called elections just after lawmakers appeared to have formed a government following months of wrangling.

One of Europe's poorest nations, the ex-Soviet state has been in political chaos since a general election in February failed to give a clear majority to any party.

On Saturday, parliament approved a new government based on an unprecedented alliance between pro-Russian and pro-European forces.

The Socialist Party of then-president Igor Dodon agreed to work with the pro-European ACUM alliance and freeze out the previously ruling Democratic Party, led by the powerful oligarch Vlad Plahotniuc.

The parties said the state was being held ""captive"" by oligarchs, adding that the country was ""wallowing in corruption"".

However, the coalition was formed after the Constitutional Court ruled Friday that fresh elections should be held.

On Sunday, the court suspended president Dodon and appointed Pavel Filip, the former prime minister from the Democratic Party, as interim leader.

Filip said Dodon had been suspended because he had refused to sign off on parliament's dissolution.

The new acting president immediately called a snap vote for September 6.

The European Union urged ""calm and restraint"" and said in a statement it was ""ready to work with the democratically legitimate government"".

EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini called on Moldova to ""respect the rule of law and guarantee democracy"".

The US urged ""all Moldovan parties to show restraint and to agree on a path forward through political dialogue,"" saying that the ""will of the Moldovan people as expressed"" in the February polls ""must be respected without interference.""

And neighbouring Romania's President Klaus Iohannis called for ""responsible dialogue of all political forces.""

Thousands of supporters of the Democratic Party held a rally in the centre of the capital Chisinau on Sunday, attended by Filip.

The party bussed in large numbers of people amid a heavy police presence.

In a speech, oligarch Plahotniuc said: ""We will go to the elections set for September 6 and win the trust of the public.""

He said Dodon was ""not worthy of occupying the post of president.""

Filip said the Democratic party had not wanted snap elections but ""in the current parliament, there is no one to work with.""

Dodon meanwhile said he was also considering the option of calling on Moldovans to take part in ""peaceful protests"".

He called his suspension a ""desperate step"" and an attempt to ""usurp power"".

The suspended president complained Sunday that the Democratic Party did not want to ""peacefully hand over power to a lawful parliamentary majority and a lawful government.""

""We have no choice but to appeal to the international community with a call for it to act as a moderator in the process of peaceful handover of power,"" Dodon said.

The Constitutional Court has already suspended Dodon several times in the last two years when he refused to back laws or appoint ministers.

458,1,"Saturday is referred to as moving day in 72-hole golf tournaments, and that was certainly the case at the Lilac City Invitational.

The final group struggled, opening the door for a handful of players to climb up the leader board at the Fairways.

Peter Lansburgh made the biggest move, firing a 6-under-par 66 for a three-day total of 12 under and a one-shot lead over good friend Jesse Schutte. T.K. Kim and first-round leader Steve Tarkon are two shots off the pace at 10-under 206.

Lansburgh started the day three shots behind North Idaho College coach Russell Grove, who was at 12 under before a messy triple bogey on No. 13. Grove, the 2013 Lilac champion, and 2016 champ Derek Barron (69) trail by three shots entering Sunday’s final round.

Lansburgh, based in Sacramento, California, heard about the Lilac from Schutte, the 2016 runner-up. The two are traveling together this spring and summer to events in the Midwest and on the Dakotas Tour.

The two went on a lengthy road trip – from Scottsdale, Arizona, to Los Angeles to Sacramento to Schutte’s home in Florence, Oregon, and then a quick stop in Eugene to check out Oregon’s campus before arriving in Spokane.

“We spread it out, stayed four or five days in Florence,” Lansburgh said. “But it was a lot of continuous driving.”

The 31-year-old Lansburgh appears to be getting more comfortable with the Fairways with each round. He opened with a 71, followed by a 67 (Friday’s low round) and a 66, matching Patrick Sato and Daniel Miernicki for the day’s best score.

Lansburgh putted well and kept the ball below the pins on the speedy greens en route to seven birdies and a single bogey.

“I made a 20-footer on 4 for birdie, but nothing crazy long. Most were in the 10-foot range,” he said. “The greens are rolling so perfect.”

Lansburgh, Schutte and Kim, who played at Boise State, tee off at 1:20 p.m. in the last group, chasing a $10,000 first-place check.

Grove reached 12 under after an eagle on the par-5 third and birdies on the next two holes. He three-putted No. 10 for bogey but got it back with a birdie on the par-5 12th. He pushed his tee ball right on the par-3 13th and found the water, leading to a triple.

“I felt like on the back nine I kind of lost focus,” Grove said. “I felt like I forgot how to play golf there for a little bit.”

Playing partners Derek Bayley (74) and 2018 champ Vinnie Murphy (76) had off days, too. Bayley, the former Washington State Cougar, trails Lansburgh by six strokes, while Murphy dropped into a tie for 22nd.

“I think I still have a shot if I can get in the right mindset (Sunday),” Grove said. “Hopefully, I’ll feel a little better over the ball.”"
459,1,"I released a terrible film about John F. Kennedy’s assassination, filled with conspiracy theories about government involvement. Despite, or rather because of, its awfulness the film contributed to the passage of the snappily named President John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection Act of 1992. The law compelled anything related to the assassination to be released 25 years after its passage, a date which fell in October 2017.

The definition of relevance was broad, which meant that a large collection of FBI records from the 1960s was made public, if only you knew where to look for them. David Garrow, a historian who has published a Pulitzer-winning biography of Martin Luther King, “Bearing the Cross”, as well as a book about King and the FBI, did know where to look. Last summer he spent two months going through new documents, including summaries of transcripts from the FBI’s Stasi-like surveillance of King’s private life.

The FBI managed to persuade the attorney-general, Bobby Kennedy, that King had links with communists and that the -men must therefore wiretap his phones and bug any rooms he stayed in. The agents did not find reds under the bed, but they did overhear salacious stuff about what was happening on top of the mattress. The agency made tapes and transcribed them. Summaries of those transcripts were subsequently made, which included quotations from the transcripts. These are the files that were released in 2017.

Can documents made by an agency that was out to get King really be trusted? Mr Garrow thinks so, and points to a 1977 report from the Justice Department which says that the transcripts accurately reflect what is on the tapes. King, who was married, had a lot of affairs, which was known already. But the documents describe powerful men arranging nights of sex with women and make for uncomfortable reading. One of the documents has a note scribbled in pencil in the margin saying that King was present when a parishioner was raped in a hotel room. That detail is the most controversial of Mr Garrow’s findings, because of the nature of the allegation and because it is not clear whether it describes something on tape.

The FBI tried to spread this information around Washington, but in an age when men, including a sitting president, could get away with coercing women into having sex there was little take-up. The agency then tried a more direct route. Agents made a tape and sent it to King with an anonymous note. “You are a colossal fraud and an evil, vicious one at that,” the letter said. “You could not believe in God and act as you do.” The letter went on to instruct King to commit suicide, or the tape would be released: “King, there is only one thing left for you to do. You know what it is.”

By any standards, the discovery of these documents by a reputable historian is newsworthy, because King was probably the greatest American of the 20th century. Yet Mr Garrow says he could not interest a mainstream outlet in publishing his findings, which instead came out in Standpoint, a small right-wing British magazine. The tapes themselves will be declassified in 2027, at which point people will be able to hear them and decide for themselves.



Correction: An earlier version of this story states that David Garrow was working from transcripts of the FBI's tape. In fact the files he found were summaries of the transcripts, which included quotations from them. This was corrected on June 6th."

On ""Face the Nation"" Sunday, Klobuchar accused Mr. Trump of treating American farmers as if they were ""poker chips"" at ""one of his bankrupt casinos.""

For days, Mr. Trump threatened to impose tariffs on all Mexican goods traveling across the southern border unless Mexico's government undertook more efforts to reduce migration from Central America, including tightening its border with Guatemala.

On Friday, however, Mexican and U.S. diplomats reached an agreement in principle to stem the flow of families and unaccompanied children from El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala heading to the U.S.-Mexico border. Last month, the U.S. apprehended more than 133,00 people near the southwestern border — a 13-year high.

Under the agreement, the Mexican government vowed to deploy National Guardsmen to the Guatemala-Mexico border, while the U.S. indicated it would expand the practice of returning non-Mexican migrants who claim asylum at American ports of entry back to Mexico to await their court hearing — a policy known as ""Remain in Mexico.""

Although Mr. Trump claimed on Twitter that Mexico also agreed to purchase ""large quantities"" of American agricultural goods as part of negotiations between both countries, the Mexican Ambassador to the U.S. Martha Bárcena Coqui refused to confirm on ""Face the Nation"" whether her government consented to such a deal.

Klobuchar said the manner through the president forced the Mexican government to start negotiations to avoid the levies was ""wrong.""

464,1,"Some state-level surveys show Warren near Biden at the top of the field. A poll by the Des Moines Register, CNN and Mediacom, which published over the weekend, combined probable caucusgoers’ first choice, second choice and candidates they are “actively considering” to show that Biden and Warren are evenly matched by this measure with 61 percent each.

Warren has captured the attention of many voters on the ground, both with her policy proposals and her willingness to make unequivocal statements that often seem to rise above the din of the campaign. It took only a few hours after the release of special counsel Robert S. Mueller III’s report, for instance, as other prominent Democrats hesitated, for Warren to issue a Twitter thread explaining why, after reading the document, she believed it was time for impeachment proceedings against President Trump.

Many voters have been skeptical of whether she has the “gumption” to take on Trump, said Craig Wellman, 71, of Clear Lake, Iowa, who attended an event over the weekend for former Colorado governor John Hickenlooper. But Wellman said he was now excited by Warren because of the way she has “fought her way back” and shown herself to be “undaunted” by the president’s attacks.

“Most of the people that I love that are running have the same beliefs that I do, the same ideas that I do, the same changes that they want to see — but I haven’t heard clear-cut ideas,” she said. “This just solidified it for me today that I am going to work on her campaign in Michigan. I’m all in. She has clear ideas and she wants to put them into practice.”

How high Warren can go remains an open question. She is splitting the party’s more liberal voters with Sanders, and many Democrats wonder whether she would be the strongest candidate to take on Trump, given her left-leaning ideas and the president’s seeming ability in the past to get under her skin. Recent surveys measuring potential head-to-head matchups against Trump show Biden with significant leads and Warren in a closer contest.

What had been intended as evidence of her heritage was criticized as a tone-deaf claim of cultural identity. The senator ultimately apologized for calling herself Native American over two decades, but the matter prompted concern among Democrats that she would struggle to defeat Trump, who has mocked her with the racially insensitive epithet “Pocahontas.”

Recent positive coverage of Warren’s campaign has especially rankled Sanders allies, according to a person familiar with the campaign’s inner workings who spoke on the condition of anonymity because that person was not authorized to speak publicly. Sanders’s team privately complains that Warren has gotten credit for ideas it says he pioneered years earlier, such as making it easier to join unions.

In other presidential campaign cycles, the “candidate of ideas” label has sometimes been a ticket to nowhere, as Democrat Bill Bradley found in 2000 and Republican Ron Paul in 2012. Democrats for the moment appear to want assurances that a candidate has plans for cementing liberal change and reversing Trump’s policies.

“Not all voters will be comfortable with her policy positions, but I think she earns respect from voters for being specific and continuing to grind out more and more solutions,” said Jennifer Palmieri, an adviser to Hillary Clinton’s 2016 campaign and John Edwards’s 2004 and 2008 efforts. “You win people over slowly. It’s more of a tortoise than a hare strategy.”

Warren’s slow-and-steady approach has been a mantra for her campaign, partly out of necessity. The senator passed on what could have been a sizzling fight in 2015 against Clinton, only to face the reality in 2019 of a more crowded field with contenders who may have a fresh-faced appeal.

She dismissed her high-dollar campaign fundraiser and decided not to hire a traditional pollster, instead embarking on a blistering campaign schedule. By her campaign’s count, she had held 95 town hall meetings in 20 states and Puerto Rico through Wednesday, taken more than 422 audience questions, held 65 media availabilities and posed for selfies with more than 28,000 voters.

To attend her events, which have grown larger in recent weeks, attendees must submit to placing colored stickers on their lapels, which mark them as a person for whom information has been gathered. Campaign aides ask attendees at every event to text their Zip code to a campaign database, capturing their phone numbers. The reward for giving up your data is a reply text with a photograph of Warren’s golden retriever, Bailey."
465,1,"LONDON (Reuters) - A host of candidates to replace Theresa May as British prime minister launched their campaigns on Monday promising to solve the turmoil of Brexit and taking shots at frontrunner Boris Johnson.

May stepped down as leader of the ruling Conservative Party on Friday, having failed three times to win parliament’s support for a European Union divorce deal that was supposed to steer the country smoothly out of the bloc and deal with Britain’s biggest political crisis in a generation.

Nominations to replace her had to be submitted on Monday, and the party’s 1922 Committee, which is running the contest, said 10 candidates had achieved the required support of at least eight of the Conservatives’ 300-plus elected lawmakers.

An 11th, Sam Gyimah, withdrew shortly before the announcement saying he had not been able to build sufficient support. He was the only one to support holding a second Brexit referendum.

Conservative lawmakers will hold their first round of voting on Thursday to begin narrowing the field.

The public campaign launches on Monday all set out domestic agendas, but it was Brexit that dominated, with overt and thinly-veiled digs at former foreign minister Johnson.

“If I get through, which I am sure I will actually, to the final two against Mr Johnson, this is what I will say to him: ‘Mr Johnson, whatever you do, don’t pull out’,” said environment minister Michael Gove, who scuppered Johnson’s 2016 leadership bid by pulling his support at the last moment to run himself.

“I know you have before, and I know you may not believe in your heart that you can do it, but the Conservative Party membership deserve a choice’.”

Nearly all the hopefuls promised they could solve the Brexit conundrum - which eluded May in three years of EU talks - in just three months, between the new leader being chosen at the end of July and the current exit date of Oct. 31.

“From my conversations with European leaders, it is clear to me there is a deal to be done; they want us to come up with proposals,” current foreign minister Jeremy Hunt said.

If the issue was not sorted out, he said, the party would be annihilated in an election and socialist Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn would take power.

Dominic Raab, who quit as Brexit minister over May’s divorce deal, said he too could secure a new agreement but promised that the United Kingdom would leave the EU on Oct. 31, even if that meant reverting to basic World Trade Organization trade terms.

“I’m the Brexiteer that you can rely on,” he said.

Others, including Johnson, have made the same promise to leave on time even if it means giving up on a deal with the EU that would smooth the transition.

Opposition Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn told a meeting of his lawmakers on Monday that Labour would never accept a ‘no-deal’ exit. “We will work on a cross-party basis to block a ‘no-deal’ outcome,” he said.

The differences between the candidates reflect Conservative disunity on the issue, which has meant that, three years after the United Kingdom voted by 52% to 48% to quit the EU, it remains unclear how, when or even whether it will indeed leave.

The uncertainty has hit Britain’s economy, which shrank by 0.4% in April, official figures showed on Monday - a bigger drop than any economist had forecast in a Reuters poll last week.

Johnson is not only the bookmakers’ clear favorite but, according to polls, the most popular with the 160,000 party members who will ultimately make the choice.

He did not hold a high-profile campaign launch on Monday, but his rivals lined up to take potshots at him and his pledge to raise the point at which workers begin paying a 40% income tax to 80,000 pounds ($102,000) annual pay from 50,000 pounds.

“One thing I will never do as prime minister is to use our tax and benefits system to give the already wealthy another tax cut,” said Gove, another frontrunner who was trying to get his own campaign back on track after admitting taking cocaine when he was a young journalist.

Critics accused him of hypocrisy, noting that, in a previous role as education minister, he had signed off on rules to ban teachers for life for taking cocaine.

Others took aim at Johnson, a flamboyant former London mayor, alluding to past criticism that he favored style over substance and failed to grasp details.

“We won’t get a good deal with bluff and bluster,” said Raab, one of the most hardline Brexit advocates.

Hunt, another of the favorites, said “a serious moment calls for a serious leader”. “We need tough negotiations,” he said, “not empty rhetoric”.

Hunt’s own campaign received a significant boost on Monday when two ministers with opposing views on Brexit - pensions minister Amber Rudd and defense minister Penny Mordaunt - endorsed him.

While the battle unfolds, May remains prime minister. Her replacement is due to be in place by the end of July."
466,1,"In January 2017, after a social media analyst for the Chicago Public Schools reviewed the Facebook profile of a Roosevelt High School student and began to suspect he might be in a gang, a police officer was summoned to the school to conduct an intervention. There wasn’t any imminent threat of violence, but the officer and a school district security official met with the student. They asked if he was in a gang.

“That is my business,” the student replied, according to a report from the intervention.

The officer, a member of the Chicago Police Department’s Gang School Safety Team, told the student he needed to be more respectful. The student said he was not in a gang but did hang around gang members.

The officer asked for their names, but the student wouldn’t give them. The officer asked if the student was considering joining a gang. He said he wasn’t sure. The student, the report concludes, “seemed to not be motivated and provided very short answers.”

Over the past four school years, more than 700 CPS students have been called into interventions like this one based on social media activity that points to their possible gang involvement. The interventions are one result of a $2.2 million award the district received in 2014 through the U.S. Department of Justice’s Comprehensive School Safety Initiative, which provides grants for violence prevention efforts.

The grant covered salaries for two intelligence analysts and social media monitoring software to analyze students’ online conversations, though officials stopped using the software in 2017. Jadine Chou, the school district’s chief of safety and security, said the analysts used keyword searches to find threats at the program’s target schools, rather than plugging in individual students’ names.

Funding for the program ran out after 2018, but district officials said they plan to continue it in some manner, saying it keeps kids safe and gives them much-needed support.

“It’s a program we’re very proud of,” Chou said. “Our main goal is to redirect students to a positive path.”

But the approach has raised concerns, in part because most students and parents weren’t told about the program or that school officials would be taking on a greater role in monitoring students’ lives. And it expanded the role of the Gang School Safety Team, a small police unit created in 2008 with a somewhat narrow mission: to intervene after a young person gets shot. After a shooting, officers show up at the victim’s school, seeking to ease tensions and head off retaliation. With the program, officers went into schools before violence erupted.

Monitoring can save lives if it’s done right, said Desmond Patton, an associate professor at the Columbia University School of Social Work who studies social media and gang violence in Chicago. But it can also venture into over-policing, what Patton describes as a sort of virtual stop and frisk that disproportionately targets people of color.

“Oftentimes when we talk about threats and violence and trauma, we are really speaking about black and brown communities,” Patton said. “So we are not zooming in on the young people at Jones College Prep or Walter Payton or Northside,” top Chicago high schools with more white students than black students.

Of the 24 schools in the monitoring program as of last year, 16 are majority black and five are majority Hispanic. Most are on the South or West sides. Forty-six percent of all CPS schools are majority black, according to the latest available data.

“It feels like a surprising invasion of privacy,” said Carisa Parker, whose daughter is a freshman at Morgan Park High School, one of the target schools. Though she has no indication her daughter’s social media activities have been monitored, she said the district owes it to parents to explain how and why her Far Southwest Side school and the others were chosen.

Knowing that violence between students often can be traced to social media posts, CPS officials pursued the grant as one way to head it off. Some principals say such posts play a role in more than 90 percent of fights between students, according to a report on the program by the University of Chicago’s Crime Lab, which helps cities study violence reduction efforts.

In 2015, the district began the pilot, known as “Connect and Redirect to Respect,” at 16 elementary and high schools to monitor students’ public-facing social media. It eventually grew to 24 schools, covering some 25,000 students, according to the Crime Lab. If students were found to have posted gang-related material, then district security specialists and school administrators would meet with the student and link them with mentors, counselors and part-time or summer jobs.

In cases where the student posed with a gun or appeared to threaten violence, officers from the Gang School Safety Team were brought in. Officers were also present in some cases where no gun was involved, incident reports show, and they weren’t called in every time there was a gun.

A review of more than 400 incident reports from the 2016-17 and 2017-18 school years by ProPublica Illinois and WBEZ shows that a police officer was brought in or informed at least 87 times. In dozens of other instances, the district’s records offer no clear indication of whether an officer intervened.

The interventions typically occurred in the same way. First, an analyst found a post or got a tip about a post, most often on Facebook, that showed a student flashing gang signs or holding what appeared to be a gun. The analyst told the district security specialist, who started an intervention — sometimes with a police officer present, and almost always with a school dean or principal in the room.

The student was asked about gang ties, warned of the dangers of posting gang-related content on social media and encouraged to delete the relevant posts while the adults watched.

In many cases, the student denied being in a gang and insisted the weapons in the photos were BB guns or toys, according to the review of the incident reports.

A few times, students expressed discomfort with the police being present. In one instance, a student at Sullivan High School, on the Far North Side, saw two police officers in the room and exclaimed: “I don’t like police!”

In another case at Taft High School, on the Far Northwest Side, the Gang School Safety Team and a police officer based at the school met with a student who was seen displaying gang signs on Facebook. The student first refused to answer questions and then called his or her mother, who told the officials to speak with her lawyer.

But the approach made sense, Chou said, because the goals weren’t punitive.

“These officers just care so much, and I think the students feel that,” she said. “It’s not a method of, ‘Hey, you better do this or I can lock you up.’ It’s, ‘As a police officer, I’m telling you I care about your safety.’”

The review of the more than 400 incident reports suggests the district mostly avoided punishing students. Only a handful of incidents appear to have prompted arrests — those were physical fights that stemmed from online spats, with the interventions occurring later — and the reports rarely indicate that students were disciplined for their posts, although administrators sometimes threatened discipline if the posts continued.

Some incidents did rise to emergency levels. At least four times, the Gang School Safety Team was called to investigate school shooting threats made on social media, and officers made after-hours visits to students’ homes to tell parents and make sure the student didn’t have access to a weapon. In one case, a student was disciplined for posting an advertisement through Facebook as a “School Shooter,” touting himself as a “very talented aimer with great gun skill.” But CPS was alerted to those threats through tips, rather than monitoring by the analysts, incident reports show.

Frank Cabrera, a senior and class president at Steinmetz College Prep on the Northwest Side, said he imagines district officials implemented the program with “good in their heart.” But he wishes he and his classmates were told their school was a part of it. Chou said school officials have mentioned to parents at community meetings that the district monitors social media for threats, but ProPublica Illinois and WBEZ found that many students and parents at the target schools were unaware.

“Communication is key between everyone,” Cabrera said. “It just shocks me that we didn’t know.”

Advocacy groups like the American Civil Liberties Union of Illinois find it difficult to justify broadening the function of police in communities they say are already over-policed.

“If they are going to monitor, there needs to be notice to the students and the parents about what sites are being monitored, how they are being monitored … and what they are going to do with all of that information,” said Rebecca Glenberg, a senior staff attorney for the group.

District policy says school officials should only call the police for one of two reasons: to seek help with an “emergency situation” or to notify them of a crime. In documents about the monitoring program, CPS officials said social media posts indicating gang affiliations don’t warrant a call to police, unless there’s also a gun involved or a threat of violence.

In non-emergency cases, administrators are supposed to make “reasonable efforts” to contact a parent or guardian before calling police. That contact is mandatory in cases with elementary school students and encouraged in those with high school students. But incident reports — like the one for the Taft student who called his or her mother — suggest the effort is not always made.

Even when arrests aren’t made, advocates worry the intelligence gathered by police will have negative consequences for students, especially given that some interventions include officers pressuring them to admit their gang affiliations. Glenberg wondered if students’ names are being added to the department’s controversial gang database.

“The police have been completely non-transparent,” Glenberg said. “So if we don’t know the criteria to get on there, if there are any, and we don’t know what is happening with all the data that is collected with the social media monitoring, then I think everything is on the table.”

Chou, the district’s safety chief, said there’s no need for concern that a student identified through the program would end up on the gang database. But a police commander who oversees the Gang School Safety Team was less unequivocal.

“I think anything could progress,” said Cmdr. Christopher Kennedy of the Gang Investigations Division, which includes the Gang School Safety Team. “I would hate to say, ‘No, absolutely not, never,’ because any scenario could build. But in general circumstances, we are not using this as a means to input as a dossier to keep on anyone.”

Sgt. Gus Vasilopoulos of the Gang School Safety Team said police often create their own documentation of the interventions. The school district has no written agreement with the Police Department prohibiting the unit from documenting interactions with students or even adding them to the gang database.

“There are so many that we don’t document everything, [but] if we talk to the kid, we do document and we do some kind of gang investigative” supplemental report, Vasilopoulos said.

A lack of transparency about the program itself has also prompted skepticism. The school district apparently implemented the monitoring without telling students and parents.

This is not only problematic but also a missed opportunity, said Parker, the Morgan Park parent, who had two older children graduate from the school. She said she’d never want her child in a room with police without a parent there, and she’d also want to know about a disturbing post so she could talk to her child about it.

Chou said there’s a difference under district policy between “interventions,” where a parent does not need to be present, and “meetings,” where parents must be brought in.

“They’re not meetings,” Chou said of the program. “We do interventions.”

Even some school officials weren’t told their students were being monitored. In August 2016, when the Crime Lab conducted interviews with 26 administrators, “only a few” at the target schools knew of the program’s existence. Administrators at schools the Crime Lab used as controls to measure outcomes said the concept made them uneasy.

“When we described the program to the control schools, a few did not want the program because they felt like it could be an invasion of the students’ privacy,” the Crime Lab wrote in a progress report.

Chou emphasized that the intelligence analysts only look at public posts, or screenshots of posts shared with them. They don’t send friend requests to evade privacy settings, she said, and she acknowledged that the software they stopped using in 2017 not only proved ineffective, but also made her uneasy.

“That general model, society has spoken on that,” Chou said. “We’ve determined that is not the right answer for us.”

Still, three-quarters of administrators interviewed by the Crime Lab said their schools monitored social media on their own, typically by having a staff member friend students on Facebook and check their posts at night and on weekends.

“It’s How We Do Business”

With some of the grant money from the Department of Justice, CPS hired the two analysts to comb through students’ publicly searchable social media, including posts made off campus and after school. Both analysts previously worked as security officers for the district, according to resumes obtained by ProPublica Illinois and WBEZ.

The grant also subsidized the district’s use of a surveillance software called Dunami, which has been purchased in the past by the FBI and the Department of Defense and helps users identify influential figures and map out human networks based on social media activity. The district used the tool until 2017, when officials decided other methods — namely, manual keyword searches by the analysts and following up on tips from staff and community members — were more effective and less intrusive.

To measure the effects of the program, the Crime Lab compared shooting victim data at target schools with data from schools with similar demographics.

In a final report released in late January, the lab said students at the target schools experienced almost 30 percent fewer shooting incidents outside of school than students in the control schools, though the Crime Lab said this result was not statistically significant because the sample was too small.

The report did find statistically significant drops in misconduct incidents and out-of-school suspensions at the target schools when compared with the control schools. Overall, the Crime Lab said the data pointed to “the promise of this innovative approach.”

Now, with funding for the grant expired, school officials acknowledged in a December memo to the Department of Justice that the number of students identified through social media searches would “drastically” decline. But Chou said an intelligence analyst remains on staff. Social media monitoring is going to continue.

“This is really not even a program anymore, in the sense that this is how we keep children safe,” she said. “It’s how we do business.”"

468,1,"Meyer was aiming to finish his quest at the Lincoln Memorial about 11 a.m. on April 29, 2019, almost three years to the minute since his departure. Then the government shutdown in late December appeared to imperil his plans. By that point, he had visited 388 sites in all 50 states and every U.S. territory except Guam. He had a number of sites still to drive to, but the last one he needed to fly to — War in the Pacific National Historical Park in Guam — had closed its visitor center because of the shutdown. (He could still have gone to the park, but he only counted visits if he was able to have what he calls “the full experience,” including the visitor center.)

Meyer was relieved when the shutdown ended in January. But soon, he had another politics-induced problem. The total number of National Park Service sites fluctuates as new ones are added and existing ones are reconfigured. When Meyer began researching his project in 2014, it was 401; when he started the trip two years later, it was 411. In February, he got wind of a lands bill moving through Congress that could increase the number of sites he had to visit. He remembers thinking, “My entire plan that I’ve had in my sights for five years … [could be] derailed.” From that moment on, Meyer says, “my life became a guessing game with the U.S. government, which is a bad game to play.”

Originally from Nebraska, Meyer moved to D.C. five years ago ""to find people more like me."" He had long enjoyed road trips and once spent nine months driving to 46 states and provinces in North America. But his previous adventures did not fully prepare him for his parks odyssey. ""Pulling off a trip of this nature is insane. I was naive,"" Meyer, now 33, says of his ""Pollyanna"" approach to plotting a course to nearly 80 historical sites, about 115 memorials and monuments, about two dozen national rivers and lakeshores, and more. (Meyer would eventually log more than 75,000 miles driving — not including miles racked up in the air or on water.)

Before Meyer’s attempt, according to the National Park Travelers Club, only 61 people had achieved “Platinum Status” for having been to every NPS site — and none had done it in a single trip. Meyer wanted to set this record, but his real purpose was to honor his late father who, he says, “loved a good road trip.” A Lutheran minister, Meyer’s father, Larry, died of cancer when Meyer was 19. Meyer’s idea was for “the road [to] teach me the lessons that maybe [my father] would have taught me on my college road trips,” as he had done with Meyer’s three older sisters. Instead, Meyer drove alone back and forth from Nebraska to the University of Memphis, where he earned a bachelor’s in voice performance.

In 2016, with money he had saved while working as the director of residential programming at a private school, Meyer bought a cargo van on Craigslist and transformed it himself “from nothing to a little home on wheels.” He added a desk and a bed, but no running water or bathroom. (On the road, Meyer relied on public restrooms and showered at a national gym chain he belonged to.) Five solar panels that he installed on the roof along with 200 pounds of batteries powered a fridge.

At night, he parked the van on side streets or in parking lots (where it was allowed) and slept with the windows closed for safety even when it was hot. He was often lonely. “The tough thing was being out in these stunning natural landscapes and … wanting to share them with someone, and then I am just there by myself,” he says.

His “fun trip” also became a job, out of necessity. He built a website and hit social media to raise money and find businesses willing to sponsor him. He noticed his Instagram following, which went from zero to 73,000, was an assortment of “NPS nerds,” adventure types, Christians and members of the LGBT community. In the beginning, he would occasionally post photos or videos referencing that he’s a gay Christian. Then in February 2017, he posted a photo of himself holding a giant rainbow flag — and began doing so regularly. He says one sponsor, which he won’t name, told him on the phone he was doing “too much LGBT outreach” and dropped him. But that only encouraged him further to try to serve as an openly gay role model — to give hope to “that kid from Nebraska or North Dakota or Arkansas or Mississippi” and show them “someone just like them who is from one of those states where it is hard to be” gay.

President Trump signed the lands bill in March, conserving millions of additional acres of wilderness, expanding national parks and creating new national monuments. The bill did not change how many sites Meyer had to visit. But it did assign NPS two new “authorized areas,” the first step to becoming an official NPS site. The law also disbanded the World War II Valor in the Pacific National Monument, splitting it into three sites, including one in Alaska that was part of a wildlife refuge managed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Meyer had been to the other two Valor in the Pacific units, in Hawaii and California, but not the one in Alaska. As April 29 approached, he worried that one of the new authorized sites would become official or, worse, that the NPS would take over the site in Alaska, requiring him to buy a $16,000 plane ticket to visit it.

On April 29, he woke up at a friend’s house in suburban Maryland and checked his phone one last time. The number of NPS sites he had to visit — 419 — was unchanged. Meyer grabbed a breakfast bar, threw on a T-shirt bearing his journey’s logo and a pair of hiking shorts, and jumped on Metro. (After three years without a parking ticket, he didn’t want to risk getting one.) At the Lincoln Memorial, about 100 of his friends and family were waiting to see him finish his quest. They clapped as he climbed the steps. At the top, he turned to face them, clasping his hands together, then gestured toward the crowd as if to say thank you."
469,1,"NEWARK, N.J. — A New Jersey gubernatorial task force examining possible irregularities in the awarding of state tax breaks zeroed in Thursday on a series of projects related to political boss George E. Norcross III that were intended to revitalize the Camden waterfront.

At a public hearing, members of the task force, named in January by Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy, said they will further scrutinize projects approved by the state Economic Development Authority under former Republican Gov. Chris Christie, including new buildings for Norcross’ insurance brokerage and a nonprofit hospital system where he is board chairman. Tax breaks for the projects totaled $285 million.

Companies related to Norcross, his charitable affiliations and the law and lobbying firms of his brother Philip received tax breaks worth at least $1.1 billion under the program, according to an investigation by WNYC and ProPublica.

A main issue, members said, involves claims made by the companies that they would leave New Jersey if they did not get tax grants. Norcross’ company, Conner Strong & Buckelew, said in its application that it was considering a move to Philadelphia without tax relief.

But Norcross said in an interview that the company did not have to show that it planned to move out of state, only that it wanted to locate jobs in distressed Camden. The task force intends to examine how the EDA administered the rules.

Task force members raised questions, for example, about the viability of competing offers made by landlords of office towers in Philadelphia. In some applications, letters of intent detailing offers had expired before applications were submitted to the state.

A spokesperson for Norcross’ company and its two partners in a new Camden office tower said the lease offers had expired because of the slow pace of government review and approval. “No private landlords would ever agree to hold open an offer for as long as government decides to take to review an application,” the spokesperson said.

Investigators also presented email evidence that Cooper University Health Care System officials were enthusiastic about moving to Camden after first telling the state they would move jobs to Philadelphia.

Cooper Health, which was approved for a $39.9 million tax break in 2014, has thus far collected more than $13 million in tax credits, investigators said.

A spokesperson for Cooper Health said in a statement the hearing confirmed that the nonprofit did not intend to move jobs out of state. It checked “no” on an application when asked if any jobs were “at risk” of leaving New Jersey, the spokesperson said.

Task force member Pablo Quinones said firms that misled the state on applications would have to pay back any credits already received.

The task force, however, was careful to emphasize that its investigation is still in its early stages.

“This is a hearing, not a trial,” the task force’s chairman, Ron Chen, said.

Chen, however, said that the task force had identified nine companies as “entities of concern,” and that some would be subpoenaed for more information.

About 40 companies from around New Jersey have agreed to submit new certifications about job creation and other promises made in their applications.

The tax break program has been under scrutiny since January, when the New Jersey comptroller’s office issued a report concluding that billions in tax breaks were approved without adequate state diligence. The investigators found that the state was unable to verify that firms that received tax breaks actually created jobs.

Murphy has called the program an “$11 billion black hole,” and his administration is considering reforms that would pare back awards and create more more benefits for host communities.

On Wednesday, Murphy cited the WNYC-ProPublica report and another in The New York Times detailing how political insiders may have influenced the program.

“Given the breadth of these findings and those so far reported by the task force, I believe anything short of a total revamp of the tax incentive program is a disservice to the hard working taxpayers of New Jersey,” Murphy said in a statement.

Christie, who expanded the tax break program and championed Camden projects, sharply criticized his successor, a former diplomat.

“While Governor Murphy was collecting his pay-to-play gift from President Obama entertaining the wealthy of Germany at embassy parties, we were back here doing the hard work to rebuild Camden from the most dangerous city in America to the most hopeful city in America,” Christie said in a statement.

The task force, without providing details, said in a press release it has already made a “criminal referral” to an unspecified agency regarding “unregistered lobbying on behalf of special interests.”

On Thursday, the task force raised questions about changes to the 2013 Economic Opportunity Act, which gave benefits to companies moving to Camden.

James Walden, the task force’s lead attorney, projected sections of the law that changed and revealed that metadata in the documents show the author was Kevin Sheehan, an attorney with Parker McCay, Philip Norcross’ law firm.

Walden walked through provisions in the bill that increased the tax breaks for several companies that were represented by Parker McCay, including Holtec International, which makes containers for spent nuclear fuel, and Conner Strong & Buckelew.

In a statement, the law firm told the Times that Sheehan’s work on the bill did not represent lobbying. The firm said in a statement, “It would be a reckless mischaracterization of Parker McCay’s activities to state that Parker McCay was engaged in unregistered lobbying in 2013.”

The former president and CEO of the Economic Development Authority testified about the changes, explaining in each case how the rewrite of the legislation resulted in a larger tax break for specific companies."

472,1,"The rest of the world watched as Hurricanes Irma and Maria — both category 5 storms — slammed into the Virgin Islands, leaving devastation in their wake. Most of the news coverage came from journalists who flew in, and had the luxury of returning home. Reporters and editors with The Virgin Islands Daily News covered a disaster happening to them.

One editor lost his house. Another lost his car. A circulation employee died from injuries he sustained during Hurricane Maria. Still, The Virgin Islands Daily News pressed on. Reporters and editors slept in the St. Thomas newsroom, taking turns cleaning their clothes in a washer/dryer the owner brought in after the storm. They produced a paper almost every day, and broke a government curfew to venture outdoors and deliver the news by hand.

The Breakthrough is a podcast from ProPublica that explores how investigative journalists report their biggest stories from start to finish, and all the hurdles in between. Previous episodes have explored how VTDigger’s reporting led to the downfall of Vermont’s most powerful businessman, how a WNYC journalist triggered an internal investigation at the New York Police Department over cops making millions in shady side businesses, and how a New York Times reporter blew open the Russian doping scandal that marred the Olympics.

For The Virgin Islands Daily News, the reporting obstacles weren’t a stubborn source or a public records request that never came through. Instead, journalists had to navigate reporting without internet or phone service, and on an island under a 24-hour curfew. Gerry Yandel, the paper’s editor, talked to The Breakthrough about what it was like to cover a hurricane while it was happening and about the toll it took on his staff and his community.

Here are a few pieces of our conversation, but you can listen to the full chat here. Subscribe to our podcast in iTunes or wherever you get your podcasts.

Jessica: Tell us what the hurricane was like — what it sounded like, and what it felt like. Gerry: You couldn't see anything, you couldn't see anything. It was like being in a blizzard. You couldn't see five feet in front of your face, and you certainly couldn't go outside. Before it got anywhere near that [bad], I tried to go out the back door through the loading dock, and as soon as I cracked the door, the wind yanked it open, pulled me outside. I almost fell on my head, and I'm thinking, “Oh, that's how people die in hurricanes.” … It just kept building, it kept building. And there was, like, a roar that just kept going and increasing. And every now and then, you'd hear something rip off of something and go scattering across the parking lot. There were a couple of points during the middle of it when it was at its peak that I actually had (a) true fear that I was in a situation that was completely out of my control. And, at one point, I thought these power cables had come down, and they were slamming against the windows over on one side of the building, and that was the office where we had stashed all the food and the provisions, and I just had a vision of that shattering … I got everybody to take all the food into the middle of the room, and then, we were sitting around in the dark.

The newspaper’s staff had gathered at the office to ride out the hurricane — Gerry said it was far safer than their homes. And without phone service on the islands, living in the same place was the only way to stay in communication. The reporters picked their own rooms to sleep in, taking up available couches and sleeping on the floor. The owner and president of the paper, Archie Nahigian, bunked with them for solidarity, eating canned tuna right alongside them.

Because of power and internet outages, the island was down to a single source of news — a radio station operated by the government. Rumors, Gerry said, were flying. But with the internet down, their readers couldn’t log onto the site to get factual reporting. The road closures and the curfew also made delivering papers difficult. So, Gerry and Archie drove around to hand them out themselves. Here’s how he describes it:

Gerry: If we saw a store open, we’d stop and get out. Or if we saw crowds of people, we’d hand them out. They were surprised. “You printed a paper?” — that was the thing we would hear. And then, they would want one and then they’d say, “Can I have another one? Somebody else wants one.” It was really gratifying to me, too, because people were so thankful to get the paper and astonished that we were handing it out. Like, “Here’s your Daily News. Business as usual.”

Eventually, they were able to start updating their website. They waited until a store opened, and stocked up on Wi-Fi hotspots so they could reconnect. Gerry and his staff provided crucial information to their readers. They published a list of people whose family and friends were looking for them, and kept running tallies on which businesses were open. They also dispelled rumors and publicized the failure of the local government to help the most vulnerable citizens. In one case, a front-page story about a woman still living in a destroyed public housing building forced the government to move her.

Jessica: How has this experience changed the way that you think about the news or the paper that you run? And has it changed the way you think about the community that you serve? Gerry: Yes, actually, it has. You know, a lot of people get into journalism to be idealistic and to change the world, and to fix the wrongs. But we have a function here to get the word out. … So, it just made me realize we have a bigger, deeper purpose here and there’s a reason we’re called The Fourth Estate.

The islands are still recovering from the storm, and The Virgin Islands Daily News will be there every step of the way. Gerry said its journalists have already begun digging into investigative pieces, and will continue to write features on the human impact of the storm. While he said this has been a transformative experience, he’s not eager to cover another storm any time soon.

“You know, that was always something that was on my bucket list as a newspaper guy. I wanted to cover a disaster,” he said. “And I have to say that I'm good now — I don't need to do anymore.”"
473,1,"FUKUOKA, Japan — One down, still others to go. President Donald Trump claimed a victory after Washington and Mexico agreed on measures to stem the flow of Central American migrants into the United States.

Trump called off plans to impose a 5% tax on Mexican exports, and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, speaking to reporters Saturday in Fukuoka on the sidelines of a meeting of financial leaders of the Group of 20 major economies, urged China to follow suit and return to stalled negotiations.

Mnuchin said he planned to have a private conversation with the head of China’s central bank, Yi Gang. In a G-20 group meeting later in the day, the two were seen exchanging friendly remarks, but there were no fresh signs Beijing is ready to compromise in the dispute over trade and technology.

“From our perspective of where we are now, it is a result of them backtracking on significant commitments,” Mnuchin said. “I don’t think it’s a breakdown in trust or good or bad faith. … If they want to come back and complete the deal on the terms we were negotiating, that would be great.”

Mnuchin said he had no direct message to give to Yi, who has participated in the 11 rounds of talks so far on resolving the dispute between the world’s two largest economies over technology and trade.

He said there were no plans for trade talks in Washington or Beijing before Presidents Donald Trump and Xi Jinping are due to meet in Osaka for the G-20 summit on June 28-29.

“This will be a one-on-one with Gov. Yi to talk alone about the trade issues,” Mnuchin said. But he added, “I would expect the main progress will be at the G-20 meetings of the presidents.”

The Trump administration began slapping tariffs on imports of Chinese goods nearly a year ago, accusing Beijing of using predatory means to lend Chinese companies an edge in advanced technologies such as artificial intelligence, robotics and electric vehicles. Those tactics, the U.S. contends, include hacking into U.S. companies’ computers to steal trade secrets, forcing foreign companies to hand over sensitive technology in exchange for access to the Chinese market and unfairly subsidizing Chinese tech firms.

The deal with Mexico helps alleviate uncertainty over the deal Washington recently reached on revising the North American Free Trade Agreement. The new U.S.-Mexico-Canada deal has been heading toward a vote in Congress and might have been stymied by new tariffs. But the U.S. is still negotiating new trade deals with Japan after withdrawing from a Pacific Rim arrangement, the Obama-era proposed Trans-Pacific Partnership.

America’s huge trade deficit with China — a record $379 billion last year — is one factor driving Trump’s frustrations with Beijing.

The United States now is imposing 25% taxes on $250 billion in Chinese goods. Beijing has counterpunched by targeting $110 billion worth of American products, focusing on farm goods such as soybeans in a deliberate effort to inflict pain on Trump supporters in the U.S. heartland.

The U.S. side has been preparing to expand retaliatory tariff hikes of 25% on another $300 billion of Chinese products, and Mnuchin indicated it was prepared to take that step if negotiations with Beijing fail. But he said Trump had not yet made a decision on that, suggesting room for further delays depending on the outcome of his discussion with Xi later this month.

“As the president has said, if we can get the right agreement, that’s great. If we can’t, we will proceed with tariffs,” he said."

475,1,"TIJUANA, Mexico (AP) — At the small migrant Juventud 2000 shelter near the border, a Honduran expressed disappointment Sunday over the agreement between Mexico and the United States to more aggressively to curtail migration from Central America.

But Edwin Sabillon Orellana of Honduras said he and his family will stick with their effort to seek asylum in the U.S.

Sabillon said some migrants might decide that waiting in Mexico for the lengthy processing of asylum requests isn't worth it, but he said he cannot take his family back to their home near San Pedro Sula, a crime-ridden metropolis that is Honduras' second biggest city.

""In my dreams I never had it in my mind to one day come to the United States,"" the 30-year old assembly plant worker said, sitting near a large pot of half-made salsa ranchera awaiting a delivery of cooking gas to the shelter's kitchen. ""I had my job, my wife had her job. My daughter was in a bilingual school — my daughter speaks English. I didn't have a reason to come here.""

That all changed in April when one of the street gangs plaguing Honduras and other Central American countries gave him a deadline of five days to begin paying a monthly extortion fee of about $120, Sabillon said. He said the gangsters thought he could pay because his daughter went to a good school, but she was on scholarship. The family earned enough only to keep food on the table and pay the utilities, he said.

Two days before the deadline, Sabillon slipped away in the middle of the night with his wife and 8-year-old daughter and left Honduras. It took them about two weeks to reach Tijuana, across the border from San Diego. They quickly crossed into the U.S. illegally near Tijuana's beach and asked for asylum. After five days in detention they were sent back to Tijuana at night with an appointment to return later this month.

The mechanism that allows the U.S. to send migrants seeking asylum back to Mexico to await resolution of their cases has been running in Tijuana since January. One part of Friday's agreement between Mexico and the U.S. to head off the threat of U.S. tariffs on all imports from Mexico was an expansion of that program along the entire border.

As of last week, about 10,000 asylum seekers had been returned to Mexico, according to Mexican officials. So far the program has been operating only in California and in El Paso, Texas. It is currently being challenged in U.S. courts.

Mexico has offered opportunities for Central American migrants like Sabillon to legalize their status so they can work while waiting or if they decide to stay in Mexico. But he is not interested.

Most Mexicans are good people, he said, but some curse migrants in the street. On Saturday, he took his family to hear Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador speak at a rally in downtown Tijuana. He wasn't able to hear the president's words about respecting migrants' human rights because the crowd around him got worked up after a woman shouted, ""Mexicans first and those from the caravan can go to ...,"" he said, not repeating the profanity.

""That hurts us a lot,"" he said.

Sabillon is at least in the fortunate position of having his U.S. court date just a couple weeks away.

Nearby, at one of the city's principal crossings to the U.S., dozens of migrants — mostly Haitians — waited in line for a number that would determine when they could cross to the U.S. to request asylum. On Sunday, U.S. border officers announced only two numbers and people who got their numbers in the past week were some 700 places away from the numbers being called, suggesting a wait of many months ahead.

Back at the Juventud 2000 shelter, Luis Torres and other parents killed time watching over the dozens of kids playing in the cramped space between tightly packed tents. The shelter, just one of many in Tijuana, is housing about 150 people, all families. Kids jumped rope and chased each other between tents.

Torres, 40, said that he and his 12-year-old son entered Texas from Reynosa, Mexico, last month. U.S. authorities then flew them to San Diego where they were detained for two weeks, he said.

Torres was confused about the status of his case, because he wasn't sure whether he had requested asylum by signing documents that agents put in front of him without explaining. In any case he was given a date to return to the U.S. in September.

Torres, a carpenter, left because his neighborhood in Honduras' capital, Tegucigalpa, is dangerous and work is hard to come by. He sent his other four children to live with their grandmother outside the city. Torres said that he and his son did not encounter problems in Mexico during the 26 days they took to reach the U.S. border.

Torres had heard talk of the U.S.-Mexico agreement, which includes Mexico sending thousands of National Guard troops to target illegal immigration at its southern border. He said it would be better if each country stuck to its own policies rather than the U.S. pressuring Mexico to do more.

""We didn't come so that they can play politics with us,"" he said."

479,1,"State firefighters continued to use ground crews, air tankers and helicopters to attack a fast-moving wildfire that broke out Saturday afternoon in rural Yolo County in Northern California.

Winds out of the northeast and temperatures in the 90s drove the Sand fire, which is burning dry grass and shrubs near the community of Guinda in the Capay Valley. By late Sunday afternoon, the fire had grown to 2,200 acres and was 20% contained.

A mandatory evacuation order was issued for homes and ranches along County Road 41. No structures had been lost, said Will Power, information officer with the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection.

On Saturday, fire crews succeeded in stopping the spread of the 50-acre Ink fire in neighboring Napa County.

Hot, dry and windy conditions are expected to continue through Sunday afternoon, prompting Pacific Gas and Electric Co. to shut off power to thousands of Northern California customers as a public safety precaution.

State authorities last month said the utility’s wind-damaged transmission lines sparked last year’s Camp fire, the deadliest and most destructive in California history. PG&E filed for bankruptcy protection in part because of the huge liability it faces in the aftermath of the fire, which left 85 people dead and destroyed nearly 19,000 structures.

Early Saturday the company turned off power to about 1,600 customers in Napa, Solano and Yolo counties and restored it Saturday evening.

In a second wave of shut-offs that started at 9 p.m., the power was turned off to 16,000 customers in the Sierra foothills of Butte and Yuba counties, including communities hit by the Camp Fire.

“PG&E will continue to monitor the weather conditions in Nevada, El Dorado and Placer counties, and may still de-energize lines there overnight if necessary,” the company said in a statement.

The utility said Sunday that it will open two community centers where affected residents can gather."

481,1,"U.S. regulators moved to discipline vaping companies for inappropriately promoting their flavored nicotine formulas through influencers on Facebook, Twitter and other social media sites.

The Food and Drug Administration sent warning letters Friday to four companies that used paid social media influencers to pitch nicotine solutions to their online followers, including flavors such as Watermelon Patch and Strawberry Kiwi.

The posts didn’t include a mandatory warning that the vaping liquids contain nicotine, which is addictive. The FDA, joined by the Federal Trade Commission, sent the letters to Solace Vapor, Hype City Vapors, Humble Juice Co. and Artist Liquid Labs. The companies did not immediately return calls and emails seeking comment Friday morning.

Facebook prohibits e-cigarette ads even with warnings, and the FTC has been pressuring influencers — people with many social media followers who promote products and services — to disclose when they are being paid to endorse something.

The action comes as the FDA and other government agencies struggle to reverse what they call an epidemic of underage e-cigarette use. Researchers have linked the trend to a surge in online videos, photos and other posts about vaping, some of them generated by companies, advertising agencies and paid influencers.

Government figures showed a nearly 80% jump in vaping by teens last year, with 1 in 5 high school students reporting that they used the devices in the previous month.

E-cigarettes typically heat a flavored nicotine solution into an inhalable aerosol. They are largely viewed as less harmful than traditional paper-and-tobacco cigarettes, and some adult smokers use them as an alternative source of nicotine. But health experts warn that nicotine can harm developing brains, and recent research shows many teenagers don’t know they are consuming the addictive chemical when they vape.

“It’s critical we ensure manufacturers, retailers and others are including the required health warning about nicotine’s addictive properties on packages and advertisements — especially on social media platforms popular with kids,” acting FDA Commissioner Ned Sharpless said in a statement.

The FDA letters do not mention Juul, which dominates the U.S. e-cigarette market. The Silicon Valley startup is widely credited with helping trigger an explosion in vaping with its early viral marketing, which included paid posts and referrals by social media influencers.

After coming under intense scrutiny last year, Juul shut its Facebook and Instagram accounts in November. Since then, the company has reworked its marketing to focus on adult smokers who are interested in quitting cigarettes.

In response to questions from U.S. senators, Juul said in April that it did not currently use paid social media influencers."
482,1,"PARIS (Reuters) - Rafael Nadal alcançou um recorde de 12 títulos conquistados no Aberto da França ao vencer o austríaco Dominic Thiem com parciais de 6-3, 5-7, 6-1 e 6-1, em uma repetição da final do ano passado neste domingo.

483,1,"(Reuters) - O secretário do Tesouro dos Estados Unidos, Steven Mnuchin, disse neste domingo que o presidente Donald Trump pode aliviar restrições dos EUA à Huawei se houver progresso na disputa comercial com a China - mas, sem um acordo, Washington manteria tarifas para reduzir seu déficit.

“Acho que o que o presidente está dizendo é que, se avançarmos no comércio, talvez ele esteja disposto a fazer certas coisas sobre a Huawei, se ele tiver conforto da China sobre isso e algumas garantias”, disse Mnuchin. “Mas estas são questões de segurança nacional.”

Washington impôs e depois endureceu tarifas de importação sobre produtos chineses em uma tentativa de reduzir o déficit comercial dos EUA e combater o que chama de práticas comerciais desleais.

O governo dos EUA também acusou a gigante de telecomunicações chinesa de espionagem e roubo de propriedade intelectual, alegações que a Huawei Technologies, uma fornecedora líder na tecnologia de próxima geração 5G, nega.

Washington colocou a Huawei em uma lista negra que efetivamente proíbe empresas americanas de fazer negócios com a empresa, e pressionou seus aliados a também bloquear a Huawei, argumentando que a companhia poderia usar sua tecnologia para realizar espionagem para Pequim.

Mnuchin disse que os Estados Unidos estavam preparados para chegar a um acordo com a China, mas também para manter as tarifas, se necessário.

“Se a China quiser avançar com o acordo, estamos preparados para avançar nos termos que fizemos. Se a China não quiser avançar, então o presidente Trump está perfeitamente feliz em avançar com as tarifas para reequilibrar o relacionamento”, disse Mnuchin.

Comentando sobre um acordo de imigração entre o México e os Estados Unidos, Mnuchin disse acreditar que o México cumprirá seus compromissos, mas acrescentou que Trump “reserva-se o direito” de impor tarifas se os compromissos não forem cumpridos.

O próprio Trump publicou no Twitter no sábado que “o México vai se esforçar muito e, se eles fizerem isso, esse será um acordo muito bem-sucedido entre os Estados Unidos e o México”."

491,1,"To hear her mother tell it, it’s a miracle that Laura Dern exists at all. In the early 1960s Diane Ladd and her then husband, Bruce Dern, suffered an excruciating loss when their 18-month-old daughter drowned. The trauma was not just emotional but physical, and doctors told her that she would be unable have another child. But they were wrong, and the proof was Dern. One confounded doctor travelled to the hospital to witness “the miracle child”. From her home in Ojai, California, Ladd’s smoky southern voice over the phone ripples gently with emotion as she talks to me about her daughter.

The miracle child, now 52, grew up to be a great actor in her own right, sometimes even appearing alongside her mother. In 1991, Princess Diana was so taken by the idea that a real-life mother and daughter could play alternative versions of themselves on screen that she flew them both to London for a royal premiere of their garlanded film, Rambling Rose. Ladd recalls “pouring sweat” as she sat next to the princess. Dern was struck by the ways in which her host connected to her character. “She was empathy in cellular form.”

Dern and I are sitting in the Whitby Hotel, in midtown New York. Dapper waiters float around with three-tiered cake plates. She is wearing a red T-shirt imprinted with the words “Mamam je t’aime,” a Mother’s Day gift from her children. “My kids know I want to move to Paris,” she explains. “When I’ve still not done face work [cosmetic surgery] at 70, there will be directors there who will hire me and we’ll get to explore while allowing me to be my age.”

A menu arrives, and Dern, who has been up since 5am nods enthusiastically at the suggestion of a strawberry tart. “A little sugar sounds amazing,” she says. The hotel is designed in the style of an English country home and Dern would like to know when we might get to talk about her love of London. “When I’m there I get to have Monmouth Coffee, the park, and the actor Andrew Garfield,” she says as if these three items were on everyone’s British bucket list. “What more do you need?” Why Garfield? “He’s a great, deep soul.” If Dern’s exuberance is a mask, she wears it very well. “It’s not ‘me’ to be a mystery,” she says, and then revises the thought. “Well, maybe I’m a mystery to a few boys in my life, but that’s good, that’s OK.”

A night earlier, she had attended a screening of Trial by Fire, based on the real-life story of Cameron Todd Willingham, executed in Texas in 2004 for a crime he very likely did not commit. It is not a spoiler to say that the movie ends with an unflinching scene of death by lethal injection. A woman in the audience had turned to a friend and joked about needing a Valium to get through it.

Long before they met in person, Dern (who plays activist Elizabeth Gilbert), had taken to writing long, intimate letters to Jack O’Connell (who plays Willingham) as a way to draw closer to Gilbert’s experience. “I reached out and said, ‘May we correspond by letter?’ and we did that very intimately, very deeply – we shared personal history and secrets.” For Dern, Gilbert’s letters were “empathy in action”. “Anyone can make a small gesture of kindness to another person that can effect change in the world, it’s that simple,” she says.

Empathy is a favourite word of Dern’s – shorthand for the kind of communion she works to find with her characters, however compromised they may seem. In conversation, she seems to be looking for points of convergence and connection, in place of the usual wariness between the journalist and subject. Trump’s demonisation of Hollywood and the media have brought us together, she says. “How do we get the word out about what truth looks like, or what people are doing, or injustice, or what it is to be human and complicated?”

The letters with O’Connell were also a kind of key Dern used to unlock her character. There is always a key. To prepare for Renata Klein, the clench-jawed control freak she plays on the runaway hit TV series, Big Little Lies, Dern interviewed female leaders in tech to help figure out her character’s motivation. In 2018, she won a Golden Globe for her efforts, one of four the series took home that year. “Renata is fierce and complicated and a nightmare, and also just wants a girlfriend and deserves to be seen because she’s lived in a man’s world her whole life,” she explains. “And what it takes for a woman in tech, a woman in banking, a woman in publishing – who you have to be and what you have to walk through to get the one seat in that boardroom of 13…”

As on the show, the misogyny isn’t exclusive to men. One CEO of a major Silicon Valley startup confided in Dern how crushed she felt after a mother sent her a photo of her son playing soccer with a note that read, “Here’s a picture of your kid, I know you’re too busy to come to the games usually.” Dern throws her hands up in a gesture of exasperation. “She said, ‘I am a mom trying to show up and the people that shame me about being a working mother are the other moms.’” Dern would hear the same story in different variations over and again. Big Little Lies is about what men do to women, but it’s also about what women do to each other, and to themselves.

Season one of Big Little Lies was framed by a mystery: someone was a victim and someone was a culprit. The who was the thread that kept audiences guessing until the finale. What can we expect for an encore? “They’re allowed to feel everything now, while also being watched,” says Dern. “What’s cool is that we are no longer servicing a whodunit plot, so the plot can be entrenched in the volcano of emotion we’re all feeling.”

On set, Dern and her co-stars have all forged a camaraderie that is novel after decades of feeling marginalised or excluded by a system that favoured men. Dern sits on the 54-member board of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, which voted to strip Harvey Weinstein of his membership in 2017. Like so many, and not just in Hollywood, she has found herself re-evaluating behaviour and structures she once took for granted. “Here we were – particularly Reese [Witherspoon], Nicole [Kidman], and myself, working alongside each other since we were basically kids – but they isolated us,” she says. “We were never with another [female] actor on set, the crew was all male, so we never said, ‘Hey, have you ever gone to a hotel to have an audition and nobody else is there, and you feel so terrified and uncomfortable?’” Of her years of auditions, Dern estimates that 75% were in hotel rooms. “You know, there’s a little couch and then a bed, and so you’d be asked to sit next to the director on the bed and read the scene that’s kind of a romantic scene, and you’re still a child?”

Dern was six when she decided she wanted to be an actor. It was 1973 and she had spent the school holiday shuttling back and forth between film sets. “My dad [Bruce Dern] was shooting Family Plot with Hitchcock, and my mom was shooting Alice Doesn’t Live Here Anymore with Scorsese and, believe it or not, at the end of that summer I was, like, ‘I think I want to be an actress.’”

For Ladd, who launched her career as a chorus girl at New York’s Copacabana, the prospect of her daughter joining the family trade was a dismal one. “I did not want my daughter to be an actress, but she outsmarted me,” she recalls. “She said, ‘Oh mother, if I could play the piano, would you tie my hands behind my back and tell me I had to wait until I was 21 to play?’” At the age of 17, Dern sued for emancipation, a kind of legal divorce that allows children to make decisions without parental approval. She says it was not personal, but professional. Ladd allowed her to leave home on the condition she live with Marianne Williamson, a writer of self-help books now vying for the Democratic nomination for president.

Although she always knew what kind of career she wanted, the template was changing by the time Dern was breaking out. “I was exposed to a real equality in the kind of characters that men and women played in storytelling,” Dern remembers. “But once I started auditioning, 10 years later, the roles weren’t the same. Something shifted and we were back to the Madonna-or-whore in a movie.”

She remembers a prescient encounter at school, when she was 14, shortly after wrapping Ladies and Gentlemen, The Fabulous Stains, about a girl punk band. “A boy was sitting with me and my best friend, and he was a year older than us, and he said, ‘I know the kind of girl you are.’ And I’m like, ‘The kind of girl I am?’ And he said, ‘Yeah, you know, there’s two kinds of girls: the kind you sleep with and the kind you want to marry.’” Dern, he said, was the kind of girl a guy married; her friend was the kind a guy just slept with. “We were both equally crushed,” she says. “It was like someone branded us.” Dern internalised the boy’s comment. “I was left feeling like if I didn’t lead with sexuality I wasn’t enough, that if I didn’t prove to a boy that I could be all things, I’d failed,” she says. “And yet I won the prize because I got picked for a long time; my friend felt hot, but a throwaway.”

It was David Lynch, says Dern, who showed her that she could be all things equally. He cast her first in Blue Velvet and then some years later in Wild at Heart, his twisted road movie about two lovers on the run. “Wild at Heart is so interesting because I’m all of it,” says Dern. “I’m the girl he picks, and she’s sexual and wild, and it’s all about mess and insanity, but it’s a gift when you can be all of it.”

Lately, Dern has found herself playing a multitude of mothers. It has come at just the moment when she finds her own children – Ellery, her 17-year-old son, and Jaya, her 14-year-old daughter, both from her former marriage to the musician Ben Harper (the couple divorced in 2012) – taking tentative steps towards their adult lives. Last September Ellery walked the runway for Calvin Klein. “Suddenly my son is 17, and I’m realising he may not always live in my house with me, and that has been rather devastating.” The actor smiles glumly. “As a parent, I felt and thought that, forever, my life would look and feel just like this.”

Meanwhile, Dern’s maternal instinct continues to blossom into a series of powerful onscreen matriarchs. “I love playing characters who lead with their desperation and their rage, and their ferocity and their loneliness and their vulnerability, because these were all things that when I started acting weren’t necessarily on the page.”

She used to think she was fearless, but turning 50 shifted her perspective. Sometimes she thinks that she is only just catching up with her daughter in the way she is learning to think about herself. “That generation doesn’t believe that anyone has the right to define who they are to them, and that includes their sexuality, their sense of self, how they want to be, quote, ‘branded’,” she says. “Boy, we were all raised so differently.” It’s become hackneyed to talk about self-actualisation, but Dern seems to be a living embodiment, a woman who might actually be able to say she’s living her best life and mean it.

“What comes with this moment in life, for me, is a kind of sense of boldness that I thought I had in my 20s, that I was actually nowhere near,” she says. “Now I feel like I’m ready to be an actor, now I feel I want to tackle anything. Now there’s just a longing to explore more, dive deeper, find things that scare me. And go towards them.”

The sea lion had what appears to be plastic packing or shipping ribbon wrapped around its neck at Boomer's Beach in La Jolla, California, animal care specialist for Sea World Brooke Hubbard told ABC San Diego affiliate KGTV.

""When there's lining around its neck, it can constrict their airways as well as their esophagus, making it so they can't breathe, working overtime,"" Hubbard said.

Video taken on Saturday by one of the rescuers shows them sneaking up on the pup before they throw a net around it, and cut the ribbon off with scissors.

After the sea lion was freed, it barked, turned back over on its stomach and scuttled back into the Pacific Ocean.

""That's the best feeling in the world, especially since we didn't have to bring it back here and rehabilitate it,"" Hubbard said.

The team had been tracking the 2 to 3-year-old sea lion for a few days before they found an opportunity to help it. Saturday happened to be World Ocean Day.

498,1,"The Justice Department said Wednesday they would continue to look for a way to add a citizenship question to the 2020 Census, reversing their decision from just one day prior, after a tweet from President Trump. A fraction of the nation’s population is already asked that question each year in the Census Bureau’s American Community Survey.

Hispanics with no citizenship answer on the 2017 American Community Survey

In the latest ACS, in 2017, the citizenship question went unanswered by about 1 in 12 Hispanics, a far higher rate than that of whites. Where these non-responses occurred can tell us where millions of Hispanics would probably be missed if the same question were added to the 2020 Census.

Hispanics from Mexico and Central America, areas targeted by the Trump administration’s immigration policies, were most likely to skip the citizenship question, so their neighborhoods would be most affected by the undercount.

The question is simple: “Is this person a citizen of the United States?”

But those words would lead to a 2020 undercount of 6 million Hispanics, or about 12 percent of the Hispanic population, according to a study published this spring by Harvard’s Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics and Public Policy.

“It’s just a really simple experiment where individuals are receiving a census form that looks remarkably similar to what people actually receive in 2020,” said Bryce Dietrich, a Shorenstein research fellow. “And half the time that form includes a question about household members’ citizenship, and in the other half of the time the question is not present.”

The Washington Post worked with Dietrich to estimate where the Hispanic undercount, as a result of the citizenship question, would have the biggest impact, distributing it by state using the citizenship non-response data for Hispanics in the ACS. For example, California accounted for 28 percent of the nation’s unanswered ACS citizenship questions, so it was assigned that share of Shorenstein’s estimate of the overall Hispanic 2020 undercount.

Hispanic undercount and its share of the total state population

The Trump administration, even as it acknowledged that a citizenship question would depress census response rates, has argued that it’s needed to enforce voting rights laws. The Supreme Court called that reason “contrived.” Reports have emerged that the proposal was racially motivated and designed expressly to benefit non-Hispanic whites and Republicans.

Opponents of the question argue that it would make the census less accurate, because minorities, especially Hispanics, will be less likely to answer some or all questions because of concerns about increasing immigration enforcement.

“It would add to a severe undercount of the population in Arizona,” said state Rep. Diego Espinoza (D). Arizona’s undercount could approach 5 percent of the total state population. “And I stress that, because for every person that is not counted, that is federal dollars that will not come to support Arizonans on a day-in-and-day-out basis.”

Lower Hispanic response rates related to citizenship also would drive up census costs by hundreds of millions of dollars, according to the Shorenstein study. Costs increase because when no one answers for a home or answers incompletely, the Census Bureau attempts a series of follow-up contacts, including sending census takers to attempt in-person interviews.

The impact of an undercount

The 2020 Census is a unique American project, aiming to count every single person in the United States at the address where they live. The public data from the census will go down to the block level, and it’s used to draw the nation’s election districts. Citizenship data is already available from the American Community Survey for clusters of blocks.

A significant Hispanic undercount would change how many congressional seats go to some states, starting with the 2022 elections.

California, with a projected Hispanic undercount of 1.8 million people, would lose two of its 53 House seats under this scenario. Texas, with an undercount of 1.1 million, would gain one rather than two seats from its overall population growth. The undercount would erase Arizona’s projected gain of one seat. On the other hand, Montana could gain a second congressional seat, and three states could avoid losing a seat: Alabama, Minnesota and Ohio.

Similar changes would hit state and local districts across the country when they are redrawn using the same data.

Another set of historic changes could come if governments won the right, probably involving another Supreme Court fight, to use any new detailed census citizen data to draw districts based on citizen population only. Across the nation, total population data is used now to draw districts.

The census plays a role in hundreds of billions of dollars in spending each year across more than 320 federal programs. While the census is short — fewer than 10 questions about each person — its expansive reach makes it the basis of population and housing estimates for the next decade and informs the design of more wide-ranging government household surveys.

Fifty-five of the largest federal programs distributed over $880 billion in the 2016 fiscal year, according to research by Andrew Reamer, a research professor at George Washington University. Half of these federal programs use a state or region’s population or per-capita income to allocate funds, making them particularly vulnerable to a census undercount. The largest of these programs, Medicaid, distributed $361 billion to states in 2016.

An undercount changes the distribution of funds, not the amount of funds, creating winners and losers among states. Reamer estimates that a 5.8 percent undercount of noncitizens and Hispanics would cause California to lose an estimated $10.6 million annually in WIC funds, a supplemental nutrition program for women, infants and children. Maryland would gain nearly $300,000.

A citizenship question would hit Texas state funds especially hard, Reamer found. The state would lose an estimated $378 million annually in Medicaid funds alone. Conversely, Illinois would gain over $9 million in annual Medicaid funds.

“The data that forms the census are the foundation for the relative functioning of the U.S. economy and government at all levels,” says Reamer. Census and its derived data provides the most accurate and reliable demographic, housing and economic data.

The data is a tool for local governments in decisions including budgeting, disaster response, land-use planning, and measuring economic or environmental impacts. Researchers rely on it to study topics as divergent as the spread of diseases and gentrification. For businesses, the data helps decide where to set up shop, who their prospective customers are, what products to launch and how to market them.

Members within all of those groups have voiced concern over the inclusion of a citizenship question and the potential undercount. The current Supreme Court case was brought, in part, by New York state, 16 other states, seven cities and the U.S. Conference of Mayors. Friend-of-the-court briefings have been filed by research and business groups alike, including the American Statistical Association, polling firm Nielsen and ride-hailing company Uber.

How we did this story

While the U.S. census conducted each decade typically undercounts minorities by a few percent, this story is focused on the Hispanic undercounts that would probably occur solely because of the addition of a question about citizenship. The citizenship question hasn’t appeared on the complete count census since 1950. It and other questions were later removed to improve accuracy and efficiency. Citizenship has remained on other surveys of population samples.

The Shorenstein study that estimated a national Hispanic undercount of 6 million, or 12 percent, was based on a survey of more than 9,000 people. The survey mimicked a 2020 Census form. Authors Matthew Baum, Bryce Dietrich, Rebecca Goldstein and Maya Sen compared results from forms with and without the citizenship question.

The state undercount estimates were produced using allocation rates for Hispanics on the citizenship question derived from the 2017 American Community Survey public-use microdata. Allocation is a Census Bureau process for filling in missing survey responses, and published data reflects when question responses are allocated.

To explore the impact on congressional reapportionment, The Washington Post projected 2020 populations for the states, based on Census Bureau estimates of population change since 2010, and compared how seats would be apportioned in 2020 with and without state adjustment for the estimated Hispanic undercount. How seats are allocated among states can be affected by small differences in relative population change.

Data on federal distribution of funds reliant on census and the estimated cost to select states of an undercount is from Counting for Dollars 2020, including report No. 5, “Distribution of Funding from 55 Large Census-guided Programs by State,” and expert reports to the Southern District of New York and Maryland district courts."

Yikes. Carter clearly meant well, but this is a train wreck by any measure.

Habitat for Humanity organizers received quite a shock earlier this week when they found that the building former President Carter had completed as part of their relief effort for flooding victims in rural Georgia was actually a 35,000-square-foot ESPN-branded restaurant and entertainment center instead of the modest three-bedroom home they had been expecting. Rather than call Carter on his mistake, however, Habitat has so far aimed to spare the 94-year-old’s feelings by pretending that the fully equipped bar and grill area and the enormous array of 100 televisions playing sports at ear-splitting volumes are exactly what they had intended for him to build and were in no way incorrect. Upon seeing Carter beaming with pride at the cutting-edge virtual golf setup he’d assembled all on his own in the restaurant’s sprawling arcade area, Habitat staffers just didn’t have the heart to tell him that it wasn’t what they actually wanted, so now everyone’s just rolling with it as if this sports memorabilia-covered theme restaurant is the same as any of their other houses.

With Carter having already spent over 60 times the original budget for the home on expensive touches like hardwood flooring modeled after an NBA court and game-worn autographed jerseys from Hall of Famers across the four major sports, Habitat couldn’t afford to rebuild the dwelling and have had no choice but to move a family displaced by flooding into the ESPN Zone despite its complete lack of bedrooms or shower facilities. The children were pretty excited that their new home came with its own air hockey table and Big Buck Hunter Pro cabinet, but the parents burst into tears upon learning that the only real place to sleep in the building Carter had made for them was atop the replica SportsCenter desk that serves as a hostess station.

This family faces a real uphill battle settling into a home where the constant din of pop-a-shot basketball games and demo-screen race noises from NAMCO motocross simulators is only out-decibeled by the Monday Night Football theme blaring 24/7 from the central JumboTron with no obvious way to turn off. It’s understandable that Habitat wouldn’t want Carter to get discouraged about the otherwise stellar work he’s done for them over the years, but moving a family into what is clearly a restaurant geared towards diehard sports fans is definitely not their finest moment.

It’s unfortunate to see such a good-hearted man get it wrong like this, and you’ve gotta feel for the family that has to live with the consequences of his mistakes. Here’s hoping Carter can get his form back and keep building homes for needy Americans across the country."
504,7,"Obama to Allow Illegal Aliens to Literally Ride Into U.S. on Giant Conveyor Belts

(WASHINGTON) —With virtually no public opinion polls agreeing with President Obama’s stance on illegal immigration, the Obama administration issued the ordering for the construction of over eight-dozen giant conveyor belts, hundreds of miles long in many instances, which will literally allow illegal immigrants (aka “undocumented guests / “Dreamers”) to ride into the U.S., without having to walk through the treacherous southwestern deserts.

With sweeping legislation via his phone and his pen, President Obama signed the “Conveying Compassion” order in what some could call the wee hours of Monday morning, giving illegal aliens a literal free ride into the U.S. and throwing a major wrench into the messages of 2016 presidential hopefuls, particularly Democrat Hillary Clinton. But some prominent Republicans in Congress are supporting the administration’s sweeping dictates that total disrespects and ignores their purpose for being, and are urging fellow party members running for presidential nomination to support it, too.

Senator Lindsey Graham (R-SC), described the conveyor belts as “humanitarian gestures” and “life-saving necessities,” as hundreds of people crossing into the United States die of exhaustion and dehydration every year in the Desert or drown in the Rio Grande. The administration’s order would also forbid any U.S. law enforcement agent of any kind from being at the receiving end of the 50 to 300 miles–long conveyor belts, allowing as many undocumented persons from unknown lands south of the U.S. border to “convey” themselves into the United States as possible.

“Not only would these conveyor belts save lives; lives of family members of many undocumented immigrants we have living in the shadows today,” said Sen. Graham on the Senate floor Monday morning, “but they would be solar-powered, too, thereby helping the environment.”

If the administration’s orders remain, about 96 giant conveyor belts, some stretching as long as 300 miles to keep illegals from crossing scorching terrain and dangerous waters, would be built in a joint effort between Mexico and the U.S. They would be peppered throughout the 3,100–mile–wide U.S.–Mexican border, allowing Mexicans and other Latin America peoples (along with a Middle Eastern terrorist or two…but who cares, you know?) to simply hop on and ride their way comfortably to the great American promise land.

Beginning as deep in Mexico as its city of Nuevo Casas Grandes and extending as far into the U.S. as Silver City, TX, the conveyor belts will undoubtedly save many people seeking better lives in the U.S., as well as give them comfortable passage for their journey.

Republican senator and presidential candidate Rand Paul, an outspoken critic of the administration’s “Conveying Compassion” directive, is already expressing displeasure with the conveyor belt order. “So now instead of securing the borders we’re going to allow illegals to literally be shuttled, ‘dumped’ into the country from Mexico, just like they were inanimate objects, like vegetables –potatoes, cabbage? …More like jalapenos,” said Sen. Paul at a campaign stop in Dallas, Texas, Monday, as he seeks to coddle hardcore conservatives to his more libertarian views within the GOP.

Sen. Paul (R-KY) said the idea of conveyor belts shuttling illegal aliens into the U.S. from south of the border was degrading to those crossing, as “a conveyor belt would demean and reduce the dignity of people to that a chattel”, according to the Kentucky senator, including that the company “360 Degree Solar Holdings, Inc.”, the company formed from the leftovers of Solyndra, the federally funded solar power company famously specious and inept, collapsing finally in 2011, would be the company fueling the conveyor belts via grand fields of its solar panels peppered throughout Mexico and the American southwest.

Also and ironically shocked by the executive conveyor belt ruling was Janet Murguía, President and CEO of La Raza, a prominent pro-amnesty advocacy group. Said Murguía in response to Sen. Graham’s statements Monday morning, “We’ve had issues with some of the White House’s provisions, like making undocumented immigrants pay a fine, earn green cards, take citizenship tests, go through background checks, learn English or do anything that in any way contributes to society. But this ‘conveyor belt order’ is certainly a sweetening component to a rather disappointing approach to increasing illegal migrants.”

Immigrant rights groups estimate that the conveyor belts could help an extra 2.5 million undocumented immigrants, mainly from Latin America, come across the border in safety each year, a fact the Senator Graham and other see as enduring Hispanics to the GOP eventually, give or take 150 to 200 years; just a blink of an eye, if you think about it....

Said fellow senator and presidential hopeful Marco Rubio to reporters shortly after Sen. Graham’s proposed amendment, “We (Republicans) have to win over Hispanics if we are to survive as a party. We must make concessions and compromise. That’s why we’ve given illegals living the U.S. a vigorous pathway to citizenship and secured the borders… Then tell me what’s secure about 100 giant solar-powered conveyor belts shuttling untold millions of strangers into the United States every year, never to be officially documented or kept track of thereafter? I want to know: what’s ‘secure’ about that? Nothing, that's what!”

“I don’t know about the rest of my Republican colleagues,” continued Sen. Rubio, “but I have read the Constitution word-for- word, and nowhere do I see where the Founding Fathers were in favor of giant conveyor belts dumping as many illegal immigrants as possible into the country, with no hope for assimilation. …So let’s be clear: to be ‘anti-conveyor’ is to be ‘anti-immigrant’? Jesus Chr...!”

John Stossel, a libertarian columnist, reporter, and regular Fox News contributor slammed the “conveyor amendment” on his Facebook page Thursday afternoon. “Liberals want open borders and illegal immigration for so-called humanitarian reasons and perceived sins of the past, White guilt, etc., while conservatives want illegals just as much, but for cheap labor. Either way it puts our country on nothing but one big conveyor belt to increased poverty, balkanization, and the loss of societal cohesion the cacophony of over-diversification has always brought to nations that have tried it.”

Senator and fellow presidential candidate Ted Cruz (R−TX), who has been one of the most outspoken opponents of immigration reform, has kept relatively silent on the conveyor belt order thus far. Instead of verbal railing, the Texas Republican has proposed a similar amendment, allowing conveyor belts to be built around the shore lines of America, leading miles out into the ocean, so decent, law-abiding Americans can ride out, drop off into the ocean, and drown themselves rather than live in a nation that both parties now seem hell-bent on turning into anything but the one in which they grew up.

Pope, Bishops Decide It’s Finally Time To Do Something About Sexual Abuse Crisis After YouTube Goes Offline

Pope Francis and bishops from around the globe unanimously decided to actually try to do something about the sexual abuse crisis after YouTube went offline yesterday. “Now that we cannot simply sit around calling synods so that we look like we’re doing something while, in all actuality, we’re just watching videos of cats chasing lasers on YouTube, we, the Princes of the Church, in union with the successor of St. Peter, have decided that we...

508,7,"Cincinnati, OH — Donald Trump announced to a crowd of over 12,000 people at an Ohio rally that as a part of his new infrastructure plan, he will sign an executive action that will include a plan to convert America’s ancient imperial measures and units to the metric system.

The announcement, which was largely ignored by mainstream media in favor of continuing “RussiaGate” coverage, was cheered by thousands of his supporters in attendance.

“There is too little discussion in Washington about how we need to join the rest of the world,” said President Trump raising his hands from the podium. “Almost no discussion about how we’re using an antiquated system of measures and numbers. And I intend to do something about this when I get back to my office. Believe you me, and that something is the metric system. There was an article, I think they used that exact term. I read other things, about the metric system. I watched our friend Bret Baier the day previous where he was talking about certain very complex sets of things happening and metrics.”

After the announcement, the crowd swelled with cheers, one man was moved to tears after hearing it.

“Oh my god. Finally,” said Scott Newell, a Volkswagen auto mechanic and staunch Trump supporter from Brooklyn who attended the Trump rally. “All day long I have to use millimeters. Then I have to switch my brain to imperial measurements when I make Stove Top Stuffing. This should make things easier for me.”

 

 

 

 

 Although President Trump didn’t outline his plan from the podium, his spokeswoman Sarah Sanders did provide some details after the speech.

“Well, the first thing we’re going to do is take off where President Carter left off in the 1970s,” said a fast-talking Ms. Sanders, who was the President’s former disgraced Trump campaign manager and now his chief sidekick. “There’s a strip of highway in Arizona where Carter switched out miles per hour to kilometers. Unfortunately, that only lasted about 2 weeks when Carter’s because he was a pussy. I believe Representative Stevens [Minority Whip Ted Stevens(AK)] at the time said something like ‘this is what would have happened if Hitler won.’ Anyhow, times have changed. And with the help of Canada’s Justin Trudeau, we hope to expedite this fundamental transformation of America.”

According to Sanders, President Trump plans on having all of America migrated to the metric system by 2018, “whether they like it or no, OK?”

“We’re calling it ‘#MAMA,'” said KellyAnne Conway, the president’s personal advisor. “We have several other such plans, some varying from three to eight years. But we think this one’s a winner. And no one does winning better than President Trump.”"

512,7,"Two weeks ago, the world watched its oldest catholic cathedral - the Notre Dame - burn to the ground.

Words could not express the intense, collective emotions of losing one of Earth’s greatest treasures - a marvel of architecture, a spiritual centerpiece and a church that had witnessed close to 900 years of Paris’ turbulent history. All that reduced to smoke and rubble...but why, how?!

“Oh man, I think I left the toaster on!” exclaimed Quasimodo, the Hunchback of Notre Dame, as he stood there among the three or four hundred angry Parisians at the base of the church as it burned. Quasimodo was in disguise, wearing a Stetson hat and a duster jacket.

“This is sooo bad! Wow! Couldn’t put it on a timer, could you Quas?” He muttered to himself and looked around. He looked behind him and on both sides and saw an angry mob of Parisians.

He suddenly had flashbacks to 188 years ago when a crowd of angry Parisians tried to lynch him."

Yikes. Sounds like Netflix actually is getting a little bit tired of seeing everyone’s long, emotional twitter threads about what they consider to just be fairly average TV shows.

“We keep seeing thousands of tweets referring to Netflix original programming like Sex Education and The OA as ‘works of genius,’ and that bullshit has got to stop. You’d really put The OA up there with the works of Virginia Woolf and Michelangelo? Give us a fucking break,” Netflix said in a statement released on their social media accounts earlier today. “If we see one more social media post calling Black Mirror ‘absolutely perfect’ as if it were a Beethoven symphony, we’re going to cancel that shit faster than you can say ‘Ozark belongs in the Library of Congress.’”

Netflix went on to explain that while they’re grateful for the support fans have shown for all of their original content, they also “kind of vomit in [our] mouths a little bit” when they see people call mildly enjoyable diversions like The Umbrella Academy or The Haunting Of Hill House “important” or “groundbreaking” as if they weren’t designed for people to half-watch on their phones while they fold laundry. The streaming service concluded their statement by warning that their viewers’ inability to retain some fucking perspective made them feel deeply embarrassed and has caused them to consider pulling the plug on all of their original programming just to stop the insufferable torrent of undeserved praise.

Sounds like Netflix is seriously pissed. In the future, it might be smart to cut down on some of the insanely over-the-top posts about how Stranger Things changed our lives or how BoJack Horseman deserves the Nobel prize for literature. If we don’t, it seems like Netflix is right on the verge of really losing it and taking these shows away from us forever."

515,7,"' D u h P r o g r e s s i v e ' occasionally runs non-satire, TRUE OP-ED pieces. This is one of them.

I have been told that I take a long time to get to my point, so kindly bear with me on this:

I will call him “Don”. We were friends from 2005 until 2012. When I met Don he was a self‒described “conservative Democrat”. By the time we were no longer friends he was a flaming Socialist, a barely coherent ideologue (hence largely why we are no longer friends). But Don helped me realize why so many of my fellow conservatives and Right-leaning brethren today either have their perception or description of contemporary liberals’ image of themselves very wrong.

Rush Limbaugh, Hannity, Levin, Coulter, Ingraham, Krauthammer, et al, have made their living raging against liberals’ love of “big government”. They talk about “big government” and liberals’ undying affection for it as if “big government” is some living, hypnotic, tangible entity (more like a seething ogre terrorizing the countryside), far detached from the actual uncoordinated cabal of millions of people, unified by and in the mindset of “Don”. And so I must tell my fellow conservatives: it’s time to break out of this endless criticism of “liberals loving ‘big government’”, as if their yearning for “big government” is an end in itself. It is not, and here’s why:

To understand the mentality of the average liberal, one must understand “Don”. Don loved helping people (a great trait to have, undoubtedly). He launched a foundation to help South Korean orphans while he was stationed there during his time in the Army (and I appreciate, despite our “break-up”, his service). He and I held the second largest-grossing fundraiser in the state of Maryland for Hurricane Katrina victims in 2005. It was fantastic. He was fantastic! But eventually such selflessness and altruism filled Don not with pride, but infected him with hubris and an eerie sense of self-righteousness. Eventually Don grew to believed he knew who needed his aid, personally, as well as on a societal level, and what specific kinds of help, regardless if such groups or individuals actually needed said help...or not. Don grew to know...better than anyone else.

Don’s mindset became (and is) a caricature of the average liberal’s. And this is such a crucial aspect to liberal “thinking” that my fellow conservatives seemingly always fail to recognize, if not point out —liberals do not love “big government” for the sake of loving it. They love it because they are it. Average liberals do not think of “big government”. That phrase is devoid from their minds; ""big government"" is devoid within their lexicon. This is something conservatives, as far as I have seen, simply do not recognize or understand about the Left. Right‒leaning people think and rail against “big government”, while liberals for the most part do not see it as anything but themselves “helping” others. They want to help you, regardless of your needing or wanting it. Average ""progressives"" on the street; your neighbors, family, friends and co-workers, but specifically those in executive, elected, and judicial offices do not think of “big government” helping people. They think of themselves helping people. It is incapable for them thinking of “big government”. Understand? The average liberal thinks of leftist-spawned legislation, taxes, bans, ordinances, mandates, etc., as avenues by which they can simply help society and Mother Earth at large, not keep growing to the “Big Government Boogeyman” as we conservatives see them doing.

*Don’t Forget to Follow ‘Duh Progressive’ on TWITTER and FACEBOOK*

Thus, when I recently stumbled on a study by The Women’s Legal Defense and Education Fund, titled “Single Parenthood in the United States — A Snapshot (2014 Edition)” showing more than half of American children today will spend some portion of their childhood being raised in single-parent/non-traditional homes, I was aghast at how much so many progressives may have foamed over it.

The report was perhaps the worst news from 2014; worse than Ebola, worse than ISIS, worse than the Russian‒Ukrainian crisis, the Ferguson riots, Eric Garner, NFL domestic violence scandals, Boko Haram, etc.

To me, this news was the most regretful and ominous of last year. This lead me to research similar studies, surveys and essays about the decline of the “nuclear family” in America, its consequences and overall future it casts on our society.

But putting yourselves in an average liberal’s (Don’s) shoes and seeing the sad and growing statistics on broken homes in America, they also see, as most Americans, regardless of political affiliation, what other statistics stem from America’s growing number of single-parent and other sorts of “non-traditional” homes —broken children...and thus future broken adults.

If you wish to research the eye-popping connections between children who are raised in single-parent homes, particularly fatherless homes, being vastly more prone to having learning disorders, emotional and psychological problems, having distinctly greater chances of slipping into substance abuse, depression, developing violent personalities, sexual aggression or promiscuity, loath authority, mingling with gangs, end up in prison, on welfare, and, to sum it all up: stand a far greater chance of being a drain on society rather than a benefit or at least a neutral component of it, then research away! If these facts are not established wisdom to you already, you will find more studies and research supporting these claims than I could ever possibly cite in a lifetime, let alone in this article. Obviously there are exceptions to the rule, and some readers whom are or have raised perfectly healthy, successful people in “broken homes” may disagree with these unfortunate facts.

“Nuclear families” on the other hand, generally produce children and thus future adults who are far less likely to succumb to any of the crimpling detriments above. But speaking from a liberal’s perspective, I must shun the image of a stable mother and father, raising authority and

self-respecting children, emotionally healthy, success-driven offspring. ...And if that nuclear family is deeply religious (Islam aside), well then, that would probably be an extra revolting shit–cherry on top of that Ozzie and Harriet, white-picket-fence-dwelling family's cake I conjure. Because deep inside, I, as a liberal, as “Don”, know what America’s unfortunately dwindling families like this ultimately produce —self-sufficient, independent, ambitious, self-reliant, and overall successful adults; i.e. people who will not need “my help"". And therefore, speaking as a progressive, I hate them! I hate them because they will hardly, if ever, need my grandiose ideas, my ponderings, my philosophical, pseudo-intellectual advice, and in all their greatest forms, my laws, taxes and bans and mandates to help them. And I hate them...for they do not need ME!

Don, like so many liberals, has a void in his psyche or soul that can only be filled by his incessant search for those to help. Now had Don been Mother Teresa in Calcutta years ago, that feverish urge to help those around him would have been perfectly palpable and understandable. But Don was hardly Mother Teresa, and took his urge to “help” to such an extreme that it became overtly creepy, and indicative of some inner pain —for he too had endured a run-away dad and shady, single-parent upbringing— for him to fill, a gaping crater of worthlessness and uselessness sprung undoubtedly from the greatest and most important person that could ever naturally fill that void from age zero —his father; a father.

So seeing that nuclear family driving down the road in their SUV with their 2.5 kids and that golden retriever in the back seat, spearing off to their little league games I believe falls distinctly on the scale of disgusting to many liberals. Such a paradigm of Americana is sickening to them because they stand a good chance of seeing it as so diverse from their own upbringings, and also because that white-picket-fence family not needing their help, their guidance, and those slimy politicians they elect, not now, or later, or ever (not counting Medicare and Social Security in this case; those programs being created so long ago and entrenched in our society).

Speaking as America’s average liberal, what Rush Limbaugh so arbitrarily calls “low-info voters” (as if any true low-info voter has any idea who Rush Limbaugh is), I can say that there is a distinct vacancy within the hearts of many progressives or any person feeling compelled to help others due to an ideology, not out of simple human reflex. So more initiatives like President’s Obama “My Brother’s Keeper” initiatives, expanded last summer by 100-million dollars, allowing millions of low-skilled, barely literate illegal immigrants into the country that are destined for who-knows how many government programs and state hand-outs, such as California’s beginning to issue drivers’ licenses to illegals to “help them” obtain work, state tuition for college to “help them” get an education and so siphon jobs away from legal immigrants and native-born citizens, to state and federal welfare benefits meant to “help” single parents (again) turning more into a bribe to stay single and work less, (granted this conclusion was reached by the Cato Institute) if at all, to the Affordable Care Act, to paying for the first two years of community colleges, to programs stemming all the way back to and before LBJ and The Great Society, the decline of the functional, married, two-parent, middle-class family has been steadily vanishng over the last half century, with the most dreary studies on it being the worst and least covered news of 2014.

With such a dismal decline in dual-parent homes and the ramifications thereof in reports as the Women’s Legal Defense and Education Fund’s detailed last year (which again shouldn’t be news to anyone not in a coma over the last three generations), such numbers of broken and dysfunctional families in the U.S. must be like a never-ending Christmas to the “Dons” of America; more people destined for depression, more people destined for psychological disorders, unable to maintain a job, more people abusing drugs, more people to slip into and remain in poverty, depression, more people who will need Don’s “help”.

I am no Social Darwinist, and this is not Dickens’ London. There are needs for safety nets for those who fall on hard times, indeed. However, as painfully insensitive as this may be to hear, what government (intrusive, coercive, manipulative and domineering government, not “big government”) programs do more is to keep broken families unmotivated to repair, and the dysfunctional American in a perpetual state of dysfunction.

Combine state local and federal programs such as endless extensions on unemployment with a popular, Hollywood-based culture that looks down on stay-at-home motherhood, promotes impulsive behavior (trust me...I fall victim to that one often), thinks that the point of marriage is about how elaborate a wedding you can throw and not about actually remaining loving, loyal, reproducing and growing old with another person, has totally decimated Black American fatherhood and their community, and is now tearing families of all colors down as well, and has millions of more “Dons” ready and forever willing to vote for politicians that promise not to help rescue the broken American “family” from emotional and economic despair, but rather ""help"" them feel more comfortable residing in it, America’s Dons certainly have their work cut out for them —so many future broken psyches, drug addicts, inmates, and chronically jobless and underemployed people to “help”.

So keep on getting divorced or never bother getting married at all, American adults, and never think of the long-term consequences of your behavior, be it to yourself and especially to your kids.

Keep on rockin’, America. Why not..? There will always be a “Don” to help you...into oblivion.

516,7,"Palo Alto, CA — Researchers from the Palo Alto, CA-based Rundex Family Foundation and scientists working for the United States Department of Agriculture sounded the climate change alarm today, after releasing a 5-year study that predicts massive overgrowth of Cantaloupe melons in the nation’s landfills due to the accelerating effects of global climate change.

“So the data doesn’t lie,” said lead researcher Robert Colvin speaking from his Mountain View, CA home office. “There has been a great deal of attention paid to prescription drugs escaping into the environment and polluting our waterways and landfills, but not much attention has been paid to the millions of tons of cantaloupe melon seeds dumped into our trashes each year. Eventually, those seeds make it to our dumps. And with the onslaught of climate change, we have a real overgrowth on our hands here.”

According to USDA scientist Dr. Pamela Butler from the University of Kansas Cantaloupe Research Center, what may seem like an innocuous blooming has real impacts on the economy.

“Oh I’m sure there are people out there who are saying, ‘we just solved the planet’s food supply problems,'” said Dr. Butler, “but I can tell you, cantaloupe plants can cause more trouble than you might think. For one, they’re very hearty and tangle up expensive landfill equipment, sometimes for days. But more importantly, no one wants to go out and harvest, let alone eat, fruit that’s been grown in potentially toxic soil.”

Adding to this dilemma, Dr. Butler points out we wouldn’t be discussing this “Canta-Apocalypse” if it wasn’t for runaway climate change.

“See, that’s the thing,” continued Dr. Butler, “cantaloupes are an indicator specifies for this kind of thing. I can guarantee you that many more menacing fruits and vegetables are coming to clog a landfill near you soon. Very soon.”

The Trump Administration had no official response, however, President Trump tweeted that this was another example of making America great again. The tweet was deleted within several minutes."

520,7,"TV fans, prepare yourselves, because there’s some news that may be not-so-great for the future of televised entertainment as we know it: HBO has reported that the scene in Chernobyl where the Russian soldiers shoot all the dogs has broken all previous viewership records and is now the highest-rated moment of television ever.

Uh oh. That’s probably not good.

HBO says that for both live viewing and streaming, the scene in Chernobyl’s fourth episode, “The Happiness Of All Mankind,” in which Soviet soldiers shoot as many dogs as they can in order to contain the spread of radiation, drew unparalleled ratings across all demographics. The ratings immediately plummet after the scene ends with hundreds of animal carcasses being dumped from a truck into a mass grave.

So, yeah, it looks like the way to succeed on television is to show soldiers systematically slaughtering friendly dogs, so it’s safe to say the future of the medium is a little dicey to say the least.

Causing even more concern for exactly what kinds of shit they’re going to be showing on TV from now on, the ratings for the scene aren’t just a massive triumph by premium cable standards: They easily dwarf every network series finale, sporting event, and news story ever aired on television. To put it in perspective, the harrowing scene—in which the squad of soldiers not only guns down adult dogs but also an entire litter of puppies—easily surpassed the ratings of every episode of the final season of CBS’s massively popular The Big Bang Theory combined, a staggering accomplishment that HBO executives say they have “taken to heart and will be seeking to replicate in the future.”

The success of Chernobyl isn’t a bad thing in and of itself—it’s a well-made show that deserves all of the praise it’s receiving—it’s just that the unbelievable ratings are for some reason concentrated on a very unpleasant scene where lots of innocent dogs are murdered. Only time will tell how the runaway success of the dog-killing scene alters the future of television, but yikes, it really can’t be a positive development, can it? It’s really impossible to think of a way it could be."
521,7,"In a moment that shook the entire VA healthcare system, a VA patient immediately identified the woman who walked into his room in a long, white coat as his physician.

Mr. Bland, who was admitted only hours beforehand for his seventh episode of congestive heart failure in four months, shocked his health care providers when he said to the woman, “You must be my doctor.”

Bystanders, including the registered nurse, were so shaken by the unanticipated gesture of respect that they only spoke to our interviewer on the strict condition of anonymity.

“In twenty-one years of working at the VA, I’ve never seen that happen before,” the nurse reported to our investigative team. She appeared visibly shaken as she recounted the event. “He didn’t ask if she was the nurse or the physical therapist. He immediately called her ‘doctor.’”

She further elaborates that she considered calling a Rapid Response because of the exchange.

“I immediately assumed he was encephalopathic,” she explained, “but his CIWA score was normal. He was even alert and oriented times four. I was so shocked, I didn’t know what to do.”

Dr. Jennifer White, the survivor of this respectful exchange, spoke to us about how his blatant lack of sexism took her by surprise.

“I usually have to explain that I’m actually the doctor about three times in the same day,” she stated. “And even then, they tend to forget by the morning. It’s just easier to let them call me ‘nurse’ or ‘honey.’”

But Dr. White says that other women providers should brace themselves for a younger generation of veteran patients, who may not immediately objectify their female doctors as their predecessors did.

“At my home institution, patients tend to address me as doctor when they see my large, red ‘M.D.’ badge,” she said, “but here at the VA, being called ‘doctor’ by a patient is a bit of a culture shock. I was just starting my pre-rounds and I wasn’t ready for such a professional conversation. He even muted Fox News just to listen to what I had to say.”

She hopes to publish this case in the Southwestern Journal of Medicine as an example to her fellow female colleagues.

“I just hope that me speaking out will inspire other female providers to come out with their stories,” she said. “It turns out, we don’t actually have to beg for respect – we can just expect it.”"

525,7,"Liberal loser and laughable loudmouth, Whoopi Goldberg, was caught on tape saying something so vile about our President that it landed her in handcuffs this morning for nearly three hours. Just before the taping of The View, on a hot mic, Golberg talked about luring President Trump to a fake conference and “castrating him and feeding him his own hairy nuts.”

The cameras weren’t rolling but the sound booth was. The conversation was handed over to the authorities, per state law, and Goldberg was detained for questioning. After nearly three hours, she was released with the investigation still “pending.” Her lawyer showed up shortly before the interview ended.

You know what that means. Rather than tell the truth that she’s a filthy, lying liberal who would kill the President if given the chance, she went and lawyered up. Now she’ll make some deal with some liberal prosecutor and the whole thing will just go away.

This turned to be exactly the case, as a quick phone call has revealed that Whoopi Goldberg’s representatives are saying that this never happened at all:

Nobody cares how The View is labeled. She should be held to the same journalistic standards we all adhere to. Whoopi Goldberg is a cancer on this country that needs to just go away."
526,7,"Grieving Debra Parsons will have her mum Doreen for Christmas dinner this year – by scattering her ashes on the turkey then tucking in.

And for dessert she’ll enjoy Christmas Pud...with a dusting of her mum’s last remains too.

Debra, 41, has felt the urge to EAT Doreen’s ashes since she died in May and has had a small 

spoonful most days to feel “as close as possible” to her.

But as she faces Christmas without her, the craving has become even stronger.

“It is the only thing that will get me through my first Christmas without mum,” said Debra.

“People might think I’m mad or that it’s not a very respectful thing to do but I just can’t stop myself.

“I see it as a positive thing – allowing her to be close to me and also involving her in the family day.

“I feel like she can live on by being inside of me because if she is part of me she can breathe through my body. My breath is her breath.

“It will be my first Christmas without her and I want her to be involved and this is the only way that feels right to me.”

Doreen Brown died suddenly from an airway obstruction after suffering a chest infection in May.

It was yet another tragedy for mum-of-two Debra, who lost a son at Christmas 1996 when he was born prematurely.

She has struggled for years to cope with her grief – but when Doreen passed away she plunged to an all-time low.

“My mum and I had a really strong bond and one which could never be broken, even by death,” Debra said.

“She has been the one who has helped me through all the other ups and downs of my life and then suddenly she just wasn’t there any more.

After the funeral and cremation Debra began to think what she would do with Doreen’s ashes – but rejected the traditional idea of scattering them at a beauty spot her mum loved.

“It wasn’t something I had ever thought about,” she said. “I always thought I would have more time to think about it.

“I knew Mum was ill but never 

expected her to pass away when she did. So when she went I had that feeling of huge loss but also of regret over all the things that went unsaid and all the times we would miss in the future.

“I decided I wanted to do something with her ashes that would make a ­difference to how we remembered her. I didn’t want to just scatter them because that would feel like throwing her away.”

Two months later, one of Debra’s two sisters, who are unaware of her unorthodox 

ritual, delivered her share of the ashes to her home.

“At first I kept them in a ­plastic sandwich bag.

“I wanted to be with them all the time so I had them by my bed or with me around the house.

“Then I got a ­little box for them so I could have them on display but no matter what I did I just couldn’t get that feeling of closeness.” But one day – when she was missing her mum more than usual – Debra had a moment of inspiration.

“I don’t know what made me do it the first time – it was just an urge. I can’t describe it.

“I opened the box and licked my fingers and just dipped them into the powder.

“Before I knew what I was doing they were in my mouth and the chalky, salty taste was comforting. I felt confused by what I had done to begin with but the feeling of comfort and closeness it brought was the first bit of solace I’d had since her death.”

Each day, Debra’s urge to eat her mum’s ashes became harder to resist.

And as Christmas nears, she is planning to take her secret to the next level. She added: “I have been having a ­little taste most days – sometimes on my ­finger or on a little spoon.

“But Christ-mas has always been a really ­difficult time of year since the anniversary of my son’s death is December 28 and as it gets close this year I feel the urge even more. Christmas is a special time of year when you want to be close to the ones you love the most and I feel the loss of those that aren’t here more strongly now than ever.

“But I don’t want to just eat the ashes on my fingers – I’d like my mum to be a part of the celebration this year so I will have her with my Christmas dinner.

“We will have a place laid for her and a picture of her on the table so she can be with us on the very 

special day.”

Debra’s fiancé – who we have agreed not to name – has supported her through her grief and they plan to marry next year.

“I am lucky that my loved ones understand what I am doing,” said Debra, of Folkestone, Kent.

“And I know my mum would have been happy for me to do whatever I needed to get over no longer having her in my life.”"
527,7,"Moments ago Tom Brady “secured” his fifth Super Bowl appearance in less than 8 years. But has anyone stopped to think aren’t the details of Tom Brady’s life a little too convenient and a little too “American Dream.”

Brady’s messianic rise to stardom starts out oh so meager, much like we see the plot of Steve Rogers in Marvel’s Captain America.

Plagued with feeble weight, tuberculosis and slow foot speed, we are to believe a man named Bill Belichik saw past all that and drafted Tom Brady to be the star quarterback of his football team. That team? The New England Patriots.

Oh, of course. Think of every 80s spy movie and what was the Soviet’s cover story: “Oh, yes, fellow American. I too labor in the job market as Strong Erect Steel Corporation in small town New England.”

His cover story of working for the whitest, All-American sounding team is patently Russian. But let’s look deeper.

When exactly did Brady go from feeble Eteve Roger’s to chisel chin dirty blonde superhuman who plays football at the age of 41?

Even worse, he has the perfect supermodel wife, emasculate white picket mansion and has a rugged yet fun dad fashion sense that could earn him a spot on Queer Eye for the Straight Guy.

America wants to see an everyman like Patrick Mahome or Drew Brees win the Super Bowl, but oh so conveniently these true American men lost out to a system of complex backroom bribes and sabotage.

Super Bowl viewership will fall yet again. Chicken wings will go I bought. America will be lost. And its all the fault of that %$#^ Tom Brady."
528,7,"Get excited, Queer Eye fans, because the show is making an incredible new addition to the cast that’s sure to make next season the most uplifting one yet: The Fab Five is adding a sixth member named Pig Boy who bites those responsible for a participant’s self-esteem issues.

Just yes! It didn’t seem possible, but Queer Eye is about to get even better!

Pig Boy, a gay boy–pig with a professional background in psychology and biting, will join the team as its official “self-esteem expert” and have his own segment devoted to gnawing and mauling anyone who causes that episode’s makeover nominee to develop low self-confidence. Earlier today, Netflix released a teaser trailer for the upcoming season that shows an emotional conversation where Pig Boy holds a participant’s hands in his mud-caked hooves and has them list off any school bully, disapproving parent, or abusive ex who has ever made them feel ashamed of who they are. Then, Pig Boy squeals and shits in righteous fury and trots away to go bite the offender as hard as he can for retribution, with Jonathan shouting after him, “Go get it, henny! Have yourself a little feral moment!”

“After three seasons of bringing fashion, culture, cooking, grooming, and design into the lives of amazing people, we’re so excited to have Pig Boy on board to help participants embrace the fabulous and healing power of biting,” said Queer Eye in a press release. “Growing up in a religious household with parents who didn’t approve of him being a gay pig person who is constantly biting and gnashing his teeth, Pig Boy is painfully familiar with the struggles that many of our makeover nominees endure, and he and his jagged teeth are ready and eager to start changing lives!”

“Fans will agree that Pig Boy is a perfect complement to the Fab Five,” the statement continued. “Whether he’s dragging hay and garbage in from outside to help Bobby give a chic new living space a rustic touch or eating all the rotten food that Antoni finds in a refrigerator to help him get the kitchen in order, Pig Boy is an amazing addition to the Queer Eye family.”

Wow! We’re already tearing up just imagining the look of happiness on participants’ faces when Pig Boy feverishly sinks his several teeth into the thighs of toxic, unsupportive individuals, leaving behind infected wounds as reminders that everyone deserves to be loved and accepted just the way they are.

And if all this weren’t already awesome enough, Pig Boy will be the first openly gay pig–human hybrid to ever appear on reality TV—just another incredible barrier broken by the most life-affirming and inclusive show out right now. Here’s hoping Queer Eye gets the new episodes finished ASAP, because we cannot wait to binge on season four!"

534,7,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – In breaking news that will infinitely complicate the already difficult process of attempting to resuscitate a patient, cardiopulmonary resuscitation (or CPR) will now require prior authorization.

The prevailing reaction to this news is best captured by a local critical care physician at George Washington University Hospital, Dr. Felicia Martin-Lowry, as she crumbled into a bumbling mess of defeat: “No… no… NOOOOOOOO!!!!”

Much like prior authorization requests for medications or other services, health care professionals will only learn about the need for a prior authorization right when CPR is initiated. The insurer will block CPR from continuing and the health care professional will need to go through the lengthy prior authorization process.

“We need to make sure that the health care team tried some other interventions before jumping straight into CPR,” explained a spokesperson for a major national health insurance company, who preferred to wisely comment under the condition of anonymity. “Expect us to ask questions like, did you try oxygen? did you try IV fluids? did you try an antibiotic? did you try bicarb?” The person went on to say that the checklist of questions will border on somewhere between 700 and 800 questions.

Insurance companies understand that CPR can be a life-saving measure. For that reason if the insurer finds that all the appropriate steps were taken prior to the patient’s death, then they will be sure to expedite the prior authorization as an urgent request, and make the decision on whether or not to approve CPR in no less than 14 days.

“Time is of the essence,” the spokesperson added, before reminding everyone that prior authorizations for CPR will only take place weekdays from 9 AM to 5 PM.

In other news, Gomerblog has learned that insurers will soon require prior authorizations before physical exams and IV placement."

Stephen Miller was CALMLY eating his breakfast of seeds and cracked corn out of a PUBLIC bird feeder this morning when RUDE liberals with NO MANNERS approached him and drove him away with a broom. Make no mistake, patriots: This is a slippery slope. We are descending into a shameless society with NO SENSE OF DECORUM where people are being IMPOLITE to government officials quietly lapping up sugar water at a bird feeder just because they have DIFFERENT OPINIONS about whether or not MIGRANT children should be TREATED WITH DIGNITY. CRUDE DEMS think that just because they DISAGREE with Stephen Miller’s STRONG policies about PUTTING IMMIGRANTS IN PRISONS that they can barge into his PRIVATE BIRD FEEDER LIFE and stop him from nibbling on NUTRITIOUS millet.

Case in point, Democrats loved it when their hero Barack Obama was president, but now that Trump is president it’s suddenly bad to be president?

Make up your mind, liberal flip-floppers: Is it good to be president or bad to be president?

Every day the hypocritical lamestream media attacks President Trump for living in the White House and being president, things they always praised Obama for doing. Liberal news outlets like the #FailingNewYorkTimes viciously slander our brave leader and say it would be good if Trump wasn’t president, completely forgetting they were all in favor of Obama being president.

Two-faced libtards might pretend they don’t remember, but they elected Obama president not just once but twice! But President Trump gets elected president just once, and that’s not okay all of a sudden?

Trump is even doing all the president things Obama was lauded for, like signing executive orders and being married to the first lady, yet it’s never good enough. #DisgustingCNN even criticized President Donald John Trump just for saying nice things about Vladimir Putin, even though Obama said nice things about many people while he was president, without a single complaint from Democrats.

It seems that leftists will never be happy with Trump until there is no president, unless they change their minds of course and decide they once again want someone to be president. The double standard is shameful. Liberal hypocrisy has officially sunk to a new low."

It’s almost impossible to keep up. That’s why ResistanceHole is now keeping a weekly tally of the Drumpf administration’s every last abuse of power, gaffe, and hypocritical statement to help you continue #Resisting President Dump every step of the way! Here’s everything horrible the Drumpf administration did this week.

1. John Bolton acted unethically and possibly illegally by taking home several nuclear warheads for a mouse problem at his personal residence.

2. The “covfefe” in chief himself defiled the office of president by repeatedly using a toilet inside the sacred White House.

3. Stephen Miller sent out a memo written entirely in WordArt.

4. Secretary of Defense James Mattis sent the oldest living World War II veteran back to war in Afghanistan.

5. President Trumplethinskin YET AGAIN failed to realize that the American people are stronger because of their differences, not despite them.

6. Melania Trump spent $4 million of taxpayer money on Gap mannequins just to see if they had organs and/or feelings.

7. An anonymous source inside the White House said they lost a really nice pair of headphones and are bummed about it because they were pretty new, too.

8. President Dump STILL bore a strong resemblance to casino mogul Biff Tannen from Back To The Future Part II—who you may recall was the movie’s VILLAIN!

9. A quietly signed executive order gives pork manufacturers free rein to store all the discarded pig brains in any citizen’s garage without their consent.

10. EPA Chief Scott Pruitt spent $500,000 on a high-end sandalwood outhouse for his office, even though he already has two outhouses across from his desk where a couple chairs for guests should be.

11. Vice President Mike Pence recommended the military send SEAL Team Six to Charmin’s headquarters to punish them for sexualizing the anuses of bears.

12. The White House’s executive chef served just the tops of apples for every meal this week.

13. For the 90th (!) time since taking office, President Drumpf has wandered onto a golf course completely naked in the middle of the night and woken up near the sixth hole as gophers were dragging him into their den by his nipples. If that sounds familiar, it’s because Drumpf LOVED to complain about the mere six times Obama did that. Hmm, hypocritical much, Mr. Mango-Mussolini?"
540,7,"The liberal 9th circuit court will not be much of a problem very longer thanks to a loophole in the law. Normally, each district covered under the court would take turns nominating a new judge with Justice Barbara P. Bailey, the 9th circuit’s only black woman, retiring next month and indeed it is a normal circumstance on the surface. It’s Arizona secretary of State Michelle Reagan’s turn — but she’s decided to put an interesting twist on the situation by allowing President Trump to choose for her.

“It’s no secret that the 9th Circuit Court has been imposing its will on Americans at large,” Reagan told the Phoenix New-Times on Monday morning. “After seeing him pick Justice Gorsuch, the best person for the job, for the Supreme Court, I have full confidence in his ability to make smart choices. He’ll make a better pick than I will.”

This spells disaster for liberals, who have been depending on the 9th Circuit’s liberal majority. Already, numerous judges have sided with President Trump multiple times but have fallen just short of the votes they needed to protect America from the liberal agenda.

“It’s time to restore the courts to what they are supposed to be: places where law and order, not feelings, take precedence,” Reagan says. Asked who she plans to recommend to the President, she told the New-Times, “I have some ideas.”

Liberals love to bash our faith in God, but they forget one important factor: we’re smarter than them."

543,7,"Since the dawn of civilization, very stupid people have been writing poetry about slime. We are proud to present to you six poems about slime written by idiots.

Oh my God! I suck! Give me a bucket of slime to sell to a baby!

I want to swindle a baby by selling the baby an 8-shilling bucket of slime

Slime comes from worms and cows and spiders

And slime comes from Hell!

My pet boa constrictor definitely wants to eat me

And I’m going to let him do it!

About the poem: August Melrose (1894-1936) is one of the stupidest people to ever be born in England. He fought in World War I, where he was wounded by sticking a fork in an electrical outlet during the Battle Of Verdun. After the war, Melrose worked in a London restaurant as a man that people could punch in the stomach if they didn’t like their food. He wrote his only poem, “Meditations On The Great War,” over the course of 18 trips to the toilet in 1936. He was eaten by his pet boa constrictor two days after completing the poem.

And each day in Hell,

The Devil himself squirts slime into a pail.

The Devil has udders on his belly like a cow,

And he tugs them and screams, “My slime comes out now!”

The Devil milks his own udders, he gives a hoot and shout,

And instead of milk, it’s slime that squirts out.

Satan’s slime squirts into the bucket with a wet awful sound,

Some slime gets in the bucket, but most squirts on the ground.

Then Satan logs into his eBay account.

He writes, “I’m selling my slime. It smells like the shitter,”

And every day Christ The Lord is the highest bidder.

Every single day this happens:

He sells it to Christ on eBay.

When Christ gets the bucket of the Devil’s slime,

He drinks it and it gives him a headache.

Then he has to lie down for the rest of the day,

In the Kingdom of Heaven.

About the poem: “Christ Buys The Devil’s Slime On eBay” was written by tennis legend Andre Agassi, and it is widely considered to be the worst poem ever written. Agassi clearly gives up trying to make the poem rhyme by the end, and everyone agrees that the story described in the poem is disgusting. After writing this poem, Andre Agassi was banned from Wimbledon forever.

3. My Favorite Thing To Have In A Bucket (A Riddle)

So you’d like to hear about my favorite thing to have in a bucket?

Let me tell you, it is a special and disgusting thing.

I love this gross thing. Can you guess what it is?

I will give you a hint: It rhymes with “Weem.”

I will give you another hint: It comes from dogs and worms and goats.

Many people think it is disgusting.

Many people carry it around in buckets and say, “I hate what I’ve got here.”

Guess what it is! Guess my favorite thing to have in a bucket!

Give up? Well here is one more hint:

Every first letter of the lines of this poem spell the answer!

About the poem: “My Favorite Thing To Have In A Bucket” was written in 1811 by the anonymous poet known only as Humple. All that is known about Humple is that he was very stupid, and this poem is famous for sucking a lot. The poem is an acrostic that is supposed to spell “SLIME,” but Humple spells it “SLIIIMMGGEB.” Historians agree that it would be very easy to figure out the true identity of Humple, but they have no desire to know anything more about him, because he is an idiot.

4. An Interesting Thing That I Did With My Head

The other day I saw slime in a barrel

And I stuck my head in the barrel of slime

My dead body was thrown in jail

And scientists named a new type of worm after me.

About The Poem: Eloise Rothke was an idiot who was born in Manchester in 1734 and drowned from sticking her head in a bucket of slime in 1784. While this poem was written more than a decade before Rothke died, it described the details of her eventual death with remarkable accuracy. However, just because she was correct in her predictions doesn’t mean she wasn’t an idiot.

Let us speak plainly about how it is with slime:

Slime is a type of horrible slime that comes from rats and dogs and goats.

When a man’s neighbor drowns in a bucket of slime,

He must go to his neighbor’s house

And say to his neighbor’s wife,

“Don’t be worried. My neighbor is your husband, and he’s dead.

He drowned in a bucket of slime and his head is still in the bucket.

I have nothing else to tell you. Do not come anywhere near my livestock.”

And that’s the way it happens in Ancient Greece!

About The Poem: Plato, widely considered one of history’s greatest philosophers, was also a massive idiot who wrote this awful poem about slime. When Plato read this poem to his student Aristotle, Aristotle said to Plato, “This poem is rancid, in terms of the words in it.” Plato then read this poem at the public Agora in Athens. When the Athenian people heard the poem they said to each other, “If a man from our city can write such a poem, we should probably now make a big effort to try to lose a series of wars on purpose.” The poem was translated from Ancient Greek into English by Babe Ruth. As punishment for translating such a terrible poem, the police forced Babe Ruth to play baseball, a sport he hated, for the rest of his life.

About the poem: This is the poem that Adolf Hitler wrote immediately before he killed himself. He read it to Joseph Goebbels and Goebbels threw his shoe at him. Goebbels’ shoe struck Hitler in the neck and it made Hitler burp. Then Hitler shot himself in the head. The poem is now mainly read to horses to punish them for biting children."

545,7,"For the last week, everyone has been talking non-stop about hookers and blow. It’s been all over the news. So to help you to understand all the talk, we will summarize the conservative position on hookers and blow in 7 easy points.

The first and most important thing to realize is that hookers and blow don’t kill people. People who abuse hookers and blow kill people. You could store hookers and blow in your house for days, even years, without them hurting anyone. The only time there is ever a problem is when some crazy person, some lunatic individual, does something bad with the hookers and blow. But that’s not the fault of the hookers and blow. It’s the fault of the crazy person.

2) Hookers and blow are here to stay

You will never be able to get rid of hookers and blow. People will always find a way to get hookers and blow. The hookers and blow are already out there. Logistically, it would be impossible to go to every single door of every single home, and search them for hookers and blow. That’s obvious impractical. Therefore, there is no point in regulating hookers and blow.

Think about this: if we criminalize hookers and blow, then only criminals will have hookers and blow. That’s pretty profound.

3) Don’t punish everyone because a few people get crazy with hookers and blow

There are hundreds, if not thousands, if not millions of people out there who are very responsible about their hookers and blow. They don’t kill people, they don’t destroy other people’s lives, and they don’t destroy their own lives. Liberals want to make us believe that everyone who has hookers and blow is a crazy person, and that just isn’t true.

You shouldn’t limit the freedom of the majority of responsible citizens, just because a few crazy people do bad things with their hookers and blow.

4) No statistical relationship between crime and hookers and blow

You can’t really prove a statistical relationship between violent crime and hookers and blow. As the graph above clearly shows, crime is gradually decreasing even though the amount of hookers and blow in the world is increasing.

In the UK, they tried banning hookers and blow, and it just made people want hookers and blow more. That’s a statistical fact.

5) We would be safer if everyone had hookers and blow

Consider this arbitrary hypothetical situation. Suppose a criminal who is addicted to hookers and blow breaks into a school or a church or some respectable place and starts killing people because he can’t find hookers and blow. Now just think about it: if everyone in that church or school had their own hookers and blow, they could totally use their own hookers and blow to calm the criminal down, and perhaps distract him, until they get a chance to knock him out with a flying ninja kick that they learned how to do by watching television.

The conclusion? If everyone has hookers and blow, it could save lives!!!

By the way, didn’t Hitler try to outlaw hookers and blow? I think he did. That’s something to think about.

7) The Constitution guarantees us hookers and blow

Finally, I know some people will call this argument “abstract” or whatever, but we actually are guaranteed a right to hookers and blow under the “pursuit of happiness” clause of the United States Declaration of Independence. It’s very clear that the founding fathers did not want the government in any way obstructing our access to hookers and blow. Anyone who wants to take away our hookers and blow must hate the constitution, and therefore hates America.

In conclusion, consider these quotations from important conservative figures:

This has been our explanation of why all good conservatives must be against the regulation of hookers and blow."
546,7,"About a dozen people carrying guns, including one with a military-style rifle, milled among protesters outside the convention center where President Barack Obama was giving a speech Monday — the latest incident in which protesters have openly displayed firearms near the president.

Gun-rights advocates say they're exercising their constitutional right to bear arms and protest, while those who argue for more gun control say it could be a disaster waiting to happen.

Phoenix police said the gun-toters at Monday's event, including the man carrying an AR-15 semi-automatic rifle slung over his shoulder, didn't need permits. No crimes were committed, and no one was arrested.

The man with the rifle declined to be identified but told The Arizona Republic that he was carrying the assault weapon because he could. ""In Arizona, I still have some freedoms,"" he said.

Keeping peace on both sides 

Phoenix police Detective J. Oliver, who monitored the man at the downtown protest, said police also wanted to make sure no one decided to harm him.

""Just by his presence and people seeing the rifle and people knowing the president was in town, it sparked a lot of emotions,"" Oliver said. ""We were keeping peace on both ends.""

Last week, during Obama's health care town hall in New Hampshire, a man carrying a sign reading ""It is time to water the tree of liberty"" stood outside with a pistol strapped to his leg.

""It's a political statement,"" he told The Boston Globe. ""If you don't use your rights, then you lose your rights.""

Police asked the man to move away from school property, but he was not arrested.

Beginning of a disturbing trend? 

Fred Solop, a Northern Arizona University political scientist, said the incidents in New Hampshire and Arizona could signal the beginning of a disturbing trend.

""When you start to bring guns to political rallies, it does layer on another level of concern and significance,"" Solop said. ""It actually becomes quite scary for many people. It creates a chilling effect in the ability of our society to carry on honest communication.""
• 
• Animated Boehner: 'There's nothing complex about the Keystone Pipeline!' House Speaker John Boehner became animated Tuesday over the proposed Keystone Pipeline, castigating the Obama administration for not having approved the project yet.
• Budget deficits shrinking but set to grow after 2015

He said he's never heard of someone bringing an assault weapon near a presidential event. ""The larger the gun, the more menacing the situation,"" he said.

Phoenix was Obama's last stop on a four-day tour of western states, including Montana and Colorado.

Authorities in Montana said they received no reports of anyone carrying firearms during Obama's health care town hall near Bozeman on Friday. About 1,000 people both for and against Obama converged at a protest area near the Gallatin Field Airport hangar where the event took place. One person accused of disorderly conduct was detained and released, according to the Gallatin Airport Authority.

Heather Benjamin of Denver's Mesa County sheriff's department, the lead agency during Obama's visit there, said no one was arrested.

Arizona is an ""open-carry"" state, which means anyone legally allowed to have a firearm can carry it in public as long as it's visible. Only someone carrying a concealed weapon is required to have a permit.

Gun-control group: ‘This is craziness’ 

Paul Helmke, president of the Washington, D.C.-based Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, said people should not be allowed to bring guns to events where Obama is.

""To me, this is craziness,"" he said. ""When you bring a loaded gun, particularly a loaded assault rifle, to any political event, but particularly to one where the president is appearing, you're just making the situation dangerous for everyone.""

Video: Protester brings gun to town hall protest He said people who bring guns to presidential events are distracting the Secret Service and law enforcement from protecting the president. ""The more guns we see at more events like this, there's more potential for something tragic happening,"" he said.

Secret Service spokesman Ed Donovan said armed demonstrators in open-carry states such as Arizona and New Hampshire have little impact on security plans for the president.

""In both cases, the subject was not entering our site or otherwise attempting to,"" Donovan said. ""They were in a designated public viewing area. The main thing to know is that they would not have been allowed inside with a weapon.""

Representatives of the National Rifle Association did not return calls for comment."
547,7,"In case you haven't noticed, comic book movies are everywhere these days. But since we've already gotten a few Superman movies, a ton of Spider-Man movies, and sometimes it feels like we're all stuck in Groundhog Day -like scenario where we're forced to relive Thomas and Martha Wayne's murder over and over again, maybe it's time for some different source material. It turns out there are lots of comics that would make great films. And we've singled out a few that should totally be adapted, none of which would open with Uncle Ben getting shot for the 37th time.

Charles Burns' Black Hole, a graphic novel about a freaky STD that turns teenagers into grotesque mutants, somehow hasn't been made into a movie yet. (It's kind of like ""X-Men meets incurable gonorrhea,"" but the gonorrhea is a metaphor for adulthood.) And to be fair, Hollywood may simply be protecting Neil deGrasse Tyson, whose brain would presumably melt like a Barbie doll in a microwave if a movie called ""Black Hole"" was less about astrophysics and more about the kind of psychosexual nightmares David Cronenberg sees when he closes his eyes.

The comic is positively dripping with a queasy atmosphere, and we know people would turn out for a movie about a magically horrifying venereal disease, because the similarly themed It Follows was a hit. But instead of random people slowly shuffling toward victims, here the beleaguered sexually active teens have to deal with this insanity:

The creeptastic tone would be perfect for a director like David Fincher, which is why it's not surprising that he spent five damn years trying to make a Black Hole movie. Even more promising, the screenplay was originally slated to be written by Neil Gaiman and Pulp Fiction co-writer Roger Avary. Gaiman and Avary eventually left the project because Fincher's process ""consisted of having over ten drafts, done over and over,"" which Gaiman turned down in the most soothing, dulcet British voice you've ever heard. Fincher himself abandoned the project to focus on The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo, to the enjoyment of literally no one. Now Rick Famuyiwa, who directed the indie hit Dope, is reportedly adapting the comic, but there hasn't been any news about it in a year."

549,7,"Ready or not, America is bringing back an old playground insult -- for the sheer fun of it. If you live in a decent-sized city and you are gay (or straight with a lot of gay friends), you or someone you know has declared something gay in the last week. Not gay as in homosexual, but gay in that grade-school ""That is so gay!"" way, i.e. lame, wrongheaded, queer in the original sense. This is happening all around you. That woman's hairdo? Gay. That book jacket? Gay. The fact that Dick and Lynne Cheney won't talk about their lesbian daughter? Gay gay gay. Backflip this story to find it again ""I use it so much I don't even think about it. It's like coughing,"" says Jose Muņoz, associate professor at New York University and author of ""Disidentifications: Queers of Color and the Performance of Politics."" ""Everyone loves it,"" says Cris Beam, a 28-year-old writer in Los Angeles. ""I remember saying it at the Gay Pride Parade this year and it was hilarious -- everyone was so thrilled to have it come back, because we'd all forgotten about it. We wanted to say it again and again and again."" And it's not just gay people who are saying it. Those gay-acting straight men are saying it, as are straight women who either have a critical mass of gay friends or have slept with enough women that they feel they can say whatever the hell they want. ""There are so many boundaries that people my age, especially girls my age, don't really recognize,"" says 25-year-old Sunny Neater, an artist in Chicago. ""The whole labeling of gay, queer, whatever seems looser."" ""That is so gay"" has made a few pop culture appearances, too. In the movie ""Loser,"" one of the geeky hero's cool roommates tells him not to be ""so gay."" On an episode of ""The Simpsons,"" Nelson kisses Lisa and his friends say, ""Ewww, you're kissing a girl, that's gay."" Will, of ""Will and Grace,"" told his best friend that his outfit was ""so gay."" This small linguistic revolution is, of course, part of the tradition of groups using derogatory names among themselves. But it's also different: The closest approximation to ""wop"" or ""nigger"" isn't ""gay"" but ""faggot"" or ""dyke"" -- both of which have gone through their own, separate reintroductions into gay, and gay-friendly, vocabularies. The difference between ""faggot"" and ""That is so gay"" is that the former has a long and nasty association with violence; it's a word adults use and have used for other adults. By contrast, ""That is so gay"" evokes childhood -- a time that may have been painful but is long past. That distance makes it possible not only to reclaim the phrase but also to reclaim it as an insult. The result is that it's completely different from the heartfelt ""I'm gay and I'm proud"" of the gay rights movement. ""That is so gay"" is simply gleeful in a way that none of the empowering words is. It's insult as pick-me-up. ""I feel happier and more sprightly every time I say it,"" says David Rakoff, 35, a writer in New York.

551,7,"A new survey released today from the Make Michigan Great Again PAC shows that residents across the state rated Flint tap water higher on the ‘Trustworthiness’ scale than democratic nominee for President, Hillary Rodham Clinton.

In the ‘Most Trustworthy’ category, Hillary scored a dismal 14% among active registered voters while Flint tap water scored a surprising 49%.

 

 

 While the final tallies were a shock to many residents, MI Governor Rick Snyder isn’t surprised at all. “Well, what do you expect?” laughed Synder, “unlike the tap water in Flint, the folks here in Michigan can see right through that woman.”

Governor Snyder isn’t buying in to all the what he called “Hysterical hoopla” surrounding Flint’s water crisis, adding, “A lot of folks in Flint like to blame all of their problems on the water. We have a name for those types of people,” Snyder takes a pause for dramatic effect, “democrats.”

Oakland County resident Stanley Taylor agrees with the governor. “At some point you have to stop blaming the water for the fact your kids are dumb and lazy.” Asked if he was surprised by the survey results, Stan replied, “I would trust a fart after a Taco Bell run more than I’d ever trust Crooked Hillary.”

Past findings from the Make Michigan Great Again PAC were also critical of Mrs. Clinton’s trustworthiness. “Hillary’s lies affects children’s brain development resulting in reduced intelligence quotient (IQ), behavioral changes such as shortening of attention span, increased antisocial behavior, and reduced educational attainment. Exposure to Hillary’s falsehoods can also cause anemia, hypertension, renal impairment, immunotoxicity and toxicity to reproductive organs. The neurological and behavioral effects of Clinton’s lies are believed to be irreversible.”"
552,7,"WASHINGTON, DC—American President Donald Trump has expressed his profound gratitude to Russia, thanking his “fantastic friend” Vladimir Putin for his support in the United States’ inevitable war with Canada.

Facing the wrath of Canada’s notorious dairy and softwood lumber cartels, the 45th President excitedly revealed Putin had personally called him via Skype to offer his unwavering support in the “unavoidable, but necessary” conflict.

“Faced with enemies like Canada, the US is lucky to be able to count on a friend like Russia,” the American President told Sean Hannity moments after speaking with Putin. “It’s at times like this you find out who your true friends are and who’s really got your back,” he proclaimed of the allegedly-former head of the KGB.

Trump revealed his trusted ally’s total commitment to “the good guys” had brought him a great deal of comfort, claiming the million-or-so Russian troops could just help “tip the scales” against the Canadian army.

“Now more than ever we need to keep our friends close and enemies closer,” he declared. “Those snow Mexicans are just as dangerous as their sunny counterparts, believe me.”

Speaking to the White House press corps, alongside a Russian interpreter, Trump revealed Canada’s careless disregard for America while considering their own domestic policy had left him with little choice.

“For years Canada has totally taken advantage of this country and now as many as 8 Wisconsin farmers have been affected. Vlad says it’s one of the clearest acts of war he’s ever seen, and he’s seen his fair share, let me tell you.”

Not long since his 100th day in office, Trump claims Putin’s free and “no strings attached” advice, has been invaluable given his relative inexperience leading a nation, or making intelligent decisions.

“You know if it wasn’t for my Vladdy, I’d probably still think Canada was just looking after their own people rather than the outrageous provocation of nuclear war, that it so clearly is.” he added, gushing at how “helpful” the Kremlin had been at immediately putting together a plan to invade Canada and seize their oil. “Honestly it’s like me and Vlad finish each other’s war crimes, it’s kinda crazy, right?”

554,7,"Michael Moore has taken to social media with a scathing and heartbreaking assessment Roseanne Barr’s downward spiral — plus an assertion that President Donald Trump is “evil” and a suggestion that the ABC network find a way to keep blue- collar stories on TV.

In a Facebook post on Friday, Moore recounted his over 25-year friendship with Barr, whose revived ABC sitcom was cancelled this week following a racist tweet targeted at former Barack Obama adviser Valerie Jarrett.

The documentarian made several comments about Barr’s mental state and subsequent downward trajectory — which he says is sprung from the “sewer of lies” from which she peddles.

“Roseanne seems to be suffering from some sort of madness. It’s more than just saying she’s a racist. She operates in the same sewer of lies, conspiracy theories and bigotry that’s been rising in America for years and that has now succeeded in electing our current president. Totally nuts,” Moore wrote.

After a sympathetic take on her upbringing as a Jewish girl in an intolerant Salt Lake City, Utah, and the merits of her groundbreaking depiction of the middle-class during the seminal first run of “Roseanne,” Moore idly drops that the singer suffered a massive head injury as a child.

“Most people don’t know that she has suffered her entire life from a massive head injury she received during a serious car accident when she was a child. Her brain injuries were immense and she spent months in the hospital struggling to recover,” he writes.

Another key takeaway from Moore is that ABC should find a way to keep America’s working families represented on primetime TV.

“The smart people who were writing this Roseanne series can surely find a way to let the non-bigoted portion of the America’s working class (which I can tell you is the VAST majority) have their voice heard on network television. Why should it be silenced by one lost soul?” he asks.

While Moore laments Barr’s behavior and the lost opportunity of her cancelled reboot, he points to what he says is a more insidious and clear-headed evil.

“Trump, though he shows all the signs of being absolutely bonkers, is not insane. He’s the real deal. His racism and hate is real, it’s well thought-out, he’s the true master of manipulation, a brilliant performance artist, and an evil genius,” Moore said.

I have known Roseanne Barr for over 25 years. I’ve known her as Roseanne Barr, Roseanne Arnold, just “Roseanne”, then back to Roseanne Barr. I’ve spent time in her home, criss-crossed the country with her to help remove George W. Bush from the White House, appeared on her shows, been there for her when she needed something, and connected her with one of my producers who did an insightful, one-of-a-kind documentary into the genius and the tragedy that is Roseanne Barr.

On Tuesday Roseanne posted hateful, slanderous tweets directed at four people: George Soros, Valerie Jarrett, Chelsea Clinton and me. A few hours later, she was fired by ABC.

For the past few years, Roseanne has been posting the craziest stuff on Twitter, like claiming Hillary was part of a child sex abuse ring being run out of a DC pizza place. She’s claimed that the Clintons have murdered people. And anyone who criticizes Benjamin Netanyahu is a “nazi.”

Roseanne seems to be suffering from some sort of madness. It’s more than just saying she’s a racist. She operates in the same sewer of lies, conspiracy theories and bigotry that’s been rising in America for years and that has now succeeded in electing our current president. Totally nuts.

Trump, though he shows all the signs of being absolutely bonkers, is not insane. He’s the real deal. His racism and hate is real, it’s well thought-out, he’s the true master of manipulation, a brilliant performance artist, and an evil genius. He outsmarted a nation of liberals and Democrats and won the White House by losing the actual vote of the people. He neutered and then destroyed the Grand Old Republican Party. He knows exactly what he is doing.

Roseanne, on the other hand, is a person who long ago broke through and brought an authentic voice of working women and men to television via one of the greatest TV series of all time. It was groundbreaking because the TV industry had historically either ignored, ridiculed or patronized those of us who grew up in the working class. Roseanne changed that.

But she is also a damaged soul. Most people don’t know that she has suffered her entire life from a massive head injury she received during a serious car accident when she was a child. Her brain injuries were immense and she spent months in the hospital struggling to recover.

I also have no idea what it was like to grow up, as she did, as a Jewish girl in Salt Lake City. Not a tolerant state, to be sure. She told me how her parents, who owned an apartment building, were asked by the U.S. government after World War II if they would be willing to house Holocaust survivors who had come to the U.S. as refugees. Her parents took dozens in, and Roseanne’s childhood was spent with these survivors as her “family.” “The stories they told me,” she said, “were filled with unimaginable horror. I’ve always wondered what effect that had on me as a little girl.”

Now, sadly, for the past few years, Roseanne has been in a downward spiral, ranting like crazy on Twitter, spreading conspiracy theories, attacking the people she used to love, supporting Trump, and being just an outright hateful and racist person. It has been a difficult decline to witness. She has repeatedly attacked me, and on Tuesday, after calling George Soros a “Nazi” (he’s a Jew and a Holocaust survivor), Valerie Jarrett an offspring “of the Muslim Brotherhood and Planet of the Apes,” and saying that Chelsea was “married to” a Nazi relative of George Soros, she then retweeted a disgusting new word for me because I have spoken out against the Netanyahu government and its killing of Palestinians — “#JewHater”. Nonstop insanity and sickness.

I guess there might be 20 million Americans (out of 320 million) who probably agree with her. She has thrown down with the lowest of the low, and who knows if she’ll ever recover from this descent into her own personal hell.

To close, I want to say just how great the new Roseanne show was. It was funny but brutal to watch because it showed how our system of greed has hurt millions of families like the Connors of Illinois. On the final episode last week, Roseanne was addicted to opioids because she couldn’t afford the knee surgery she needed, so she suffered along in agonizing pain. Dan, her husband, in order to raise money for her surgery, decided to take a non-union job — and Roseanne berates him for doing so and letting his union brothers and sisters down. There are a couple quick knocks on Trump, making it clear that the real Roseanne was not writing or running this show. For the past 9 weeks, the new Roseanne show has shined a powerful and necessary light on what it means to be working class in 2018. Her blended family on this new series was white and black and LGBTQ, and her generous neighbors next door were Muslims who forced her to confront her own bigotry.

If only her art could have helped her in her real life."
555,7,"CLEVELAND – Days after the controversial Game 1 of the NBA Finals between the Cleveland Cavaliers and the Golden State Warriors, Cavs guard Jr smith admitted that he was slightly drunk during the second half and overtime.

Everybody has heard about the Cavs final play of regulation, when George Hill missed his second free throw that could’ve gave his team a 1 point lead, which followed by Jr Smith getting the rebound and running out the clock rather than go for the last shot to win the game. The fury on Lebron James’ face said it all. But what happened? It is widely believed that Jr Smith though they were up by 1, but how can one make such a careless mistake?

“I was drunk as hell y’all i’m sorry, I wanna say sorry to the fans and Lebron, that henny go crazy and i thought hennything was possible”, said JR smith to reporters on Saturday. Jr Smith was apparently drinking Hennessy cognac during halftime, a drink that Jr Smith is apparently known for liking.

Although Jr Smith is incredibly stupid for getting tipsy during Game 1 of the NBA Finals, we have to admit that we’re slightly relieved that Jr was tipsy. “Would’ve been a lot worse if he wasn’t drinking” said Cavs coach Tyrone Lue who also already forgave Jr Smith, “If he was sober and that stupid, then we would have a problem”.

Teammates and locker room officials say they have no idea how Jr was able to take shots of henny during halftime with none of them noticing. “If there’s one thing Jr is good at, it’s drinking with nobody noticing, because it ain’t basketball.” said Lebron James.

556,7,"Tucking into the foods of our childhood can conjure up fond memories of home. But while some regional delicacies remain firmly local, others travel to other parts of the country or even the world.

Mary-Ellen Johnson recalls the warmth of her favourite winter meal - a rectangle of steamed suet pastry encasing squares of fatless smoked bacon and slices of onion.

As one of eight children her family was ""very poor"" but ""fed well"" by her mother, who often turned to the Sussex bacon and onion pudding.

""The foods of childhood remind me of being home with mum and my many siblings and it brings back many good memories,"" said Ms Johnson, who grew up in Hove.

""I'm now gluten-free and I really miss eating this with mashed potatoes, green vegetables and onion gravy.""

According to the 64-year-old, none of her neighbours in Essex where she lives now have ever heard of the dish.

Nor has she ever encountered it on her travels around England.

But blogger Lucy Stableford-Grieve has been using the same ingredients in Kent, to make what she calls a bacon and onion roly poly.

""My mum and dad remember it as one of their favourite school dinners in the late fifties and early sixties,"" said the 37-year-old.

""I was looking through my mum's old recipe books and found the traditional steaming method.

""I muddled through and adapted it for the oven and now I make it for my kids and they love it.""

Similar recipes like Berkshire bacon pudding and Romany bacon pudding can be found around England - so how have they travelled to other parts of the country?

Cookery historian, professor Roland Rotherham, said the steamed or boiled pudding can be traced back to Roman times.

It was easy to cook, tasty, and required minimal amounts of water, which was collected from wells and brooks then boiled.

The fact it was later adopted by the Anglo Saxons is typical of the fact that people take their favourite dishes with them when they move to pastures new.

""These are the tastes we travel with and introduce to where we settle,"" he said, which could explain why variations of them pop up across the country.

The Staffordshire oatcake is a prime example - not only has it crossed county lines, homesick expats made headlines when they started cooking them up in the United States.

There's a reason for that, says Stoke-on-Trent resident Michael Collins - they're ""food from the gods"".

His love for the savoury pancake started 60 years ago, when he would roll it up and dip it in bacon fat for breakfast.

""It tasted lovely,"" he said nostalgically. ""Almost better than the bacon itself.""

Food writer Xanthe Clay described the humble foodstuff - made from oatmeal, flour and yeast - as a ""a wonderful thing"".

""Who needs sissy tortillas or burritos or wraps when you can have a proper sustaining Staffordshire oatcake?

""[It] can be filled with cheese or whatever you like, and eaten hot or cold... plus they are full of lovely slow-burning carbs, and delicious too.""

Nearby, in the West Midlands, a meatball made of pig offal encased in part of the animal's stomach is a regular sight on the region's menus.

But despite being an ""archetypal Black Country food"" it's not to everyone's tastes, said David Cowing, from Sutton Coldfield.

""I came from the Lake District in 1972 and I remember being introduced to faggots by a local and absolutely loving them for their rich flavour.

""For years I had no idea what the ingredients were. We had them every year for about 10 years at a school summer camp I was involved in.

""Not all the kids were as keen to eat them as me so there were always extra helpings.""

Michelin starred chef Glynn Purnell is a ""big advocate"" of the divisive dish.

He said the recent surge in ""nose-to-tail"" eating - a movement which looks to cook the whole animal rather than focus on choice cuts - has seen faggots popping up at eateries across the UK.

""It is estimated that tens of millions of faggots are eaten every year, so they can't be that unpopular,"" he reasoned.

The foodie, from Solihull, gave faggots their five minutes of fame when he served a twist on the meal - which is often served with mash and peas - on BBC Two's Great British Menu.

""What can be quite scary is the thought of a lung, heart and kidney staring at you - it's enough to make any meat eater a veggie.

""But faggots turn that ... into a delicious, rich, moist, sophisticated piece of cooking.

""The strong flavour of offal and unusual, challenging textures can be a delight to the culinary adventurer.""

A dish that has not quite made the leap on to the nation's plate is the oddly named groaty dick.

Prof Rotherham said it may have originally arrived with Welsh ""navvies digging out the cuttings for the canal systems"".

But the thick meat porridge - sometimes known as groaty pudding - found its way to the Black Country, where it is still made at the Black Country Living Museum's bonfire night.

Made from oat husks, leeks, onions stock and cheap cuts of beef, its appeal once lay in the fact it was ""calorie heavy, cheap to make and could be left on the range for hours while out at work or looking after children,"" said curator Grant Bird.

The dish's stodgy structure also made it a portable meal for the working classes, said chef Keith Floyd, who visited the area in 1988 to learn how to make the traditional recipe.

""In the olden days they'd cook this so thick, let it get cold, then cut it like a cake...the man would take a slice of this in his satchel to work and munch on it.""

But the quality of the ingredients and general appearance has meant that unlike faggots, it has not been hailed a culinary delight further afield.

""Today it's seen as quite low grade food,"" said Mr Bird, diplomatically.

""From a flavour profile it's not brilliant and it looks horrible.""

So is the movement of recipes from one place to another simply a matter of taste?

Not so, says Prof Rotherham.

""The reason that many recipes remained regional is down to the fact that many people did not travel, even after the Industrial Revolution.

""The recipes stayed within certain boundaries. Those that did travel brought the food with them.""

But Ms Clay believes that could be about to change because we are in the midst of a regional delicacy resurgence.

""I think we are becoming even more interested in local foods because of gastro-tourism.

""People travel to places because of the food we can't eat anywhere else and that's brilliant.

""The more we explore these dishes the more we will be going through old recipes and bringing up old memories.""

Who knows what might end up on our plate next.

And this week, he did something that’s going to make you love him more than ever: When 9-year-old Michael Latorre died in a hospital, Chris Pratt made an appearance to weigh the boy’s heart against a feather and judge whether he was worthy to enter the kingdom of Osiris.

Wow, Chris Pratt truly is the nicest guy around!

When Pratt learned that Michael had died of leukemia and was a huge Guardians Of The Galaxy fan, he immediately traveled into Duat, the realm of the dead, to preside over the boy’s trial in the Hall of Two Truths. The Jurassic World celeb wasted no time taking Michael’s heart from his chest and placing it upon a golden scale to see if his earthly sins made it heavier than the Feather of Ma’at, or if he was free of evil and worthy to reside in the blissful reed fields of Aaru—but not before signing the heart with an autograph and a heartfelt message just for Michael!

Seriously, does it get any sweeter than Chris Pratt? What a dream come true for any Marvel fan who is dead and finding out their ultimate destiny!

Unfortunately, Michael’s mortal misdeeds had burdened his spirit, causing him to fail the test. After the heart sank downward, Chris Pratt tossed it to the crocodile-headed goddess Ammut, who devoured it whole and damned the boy’s soul to eternal restlessness. It’s a shame that Michael isn’t going to enjoy paradise, but if someone has to condemn you to an afterlife of endless suffering, you couldn’t hope for a better judge than the Parks And Rec star! Thank you, Chris Pratt, for being a hero on screen and off! Swoon!"

567,7,"Amsterdam, Netherlands – According to Dutch police, a crazed man detonated a devastating photobomb on an unsuspecting newlywed couple visiting Amsterdam on their honeymoon.

The couple, John and Maggie Hillard from Manistique, Michigan, was taking a tour of the city Tuesday afternoon and taking pictures when a man suddenly appeared out of nowhere and shouted “Allahu Akbar!” (God is Great) before photobombing what would have been a very nice picture of the beautiful Amstel River.

Netherlands Prime Minister Mark Rutte was on holiday in the south of France but returned immediately for an emergency meeting with the country’s National Security Council.

“I condemn any and all photobombing,” the prime minister said. “Thoughts are with the victims of this heinous attack. We have the suspect in custody and are monitoring the situation closely.”

“Initial indications very clearly point towards terrorism,” he told the Dutch newspaper De Telegraaf.

While Mr. Hillard escaped unharmed, his wife Maggie was treated and released for minor emotional distress. It is currently unknown if the couple plan to pursue charges.

The suspect, Amir Fahdi, 39, told investigators that he too was visiting Amsterdam as a tourist and was just asking the newlyweds for directions. “We’re looking into his claims,” said lead investigator, Martyn Verhoeven.

Records show Mr. Fahdi was recently questioned by FBI officials in the U.S. after he allegedly launched a cyber attack that left an acquaintance’s inbox destroyed."

569,7,"Women who remain die-hard feminists well into adulthood are oftentimes the least desirable specimens, science now claims.

“The only relationships they have are often ones with other females who subscribe to the same strict ideologies, and serve as echo chambers for extremist thought. The stereotype of overweight, unattractive, bitter, resentful hags with a chip on their shoulder isn’t really too far from the truth,” said Sheila Baker, director of the Garrison Institute located in Langford, Mississippi.

“Women who quickly abandon feminism are just happier in the long run,” Harman told National Report. “Once they engage in a healthy relationship with a member of the opposite sex, 78% of women realize that they had been brainwashed via college campuses and social media. They’re ashamed of having associated with a mob of mentally-ill whiners and seek to distance themselves from that lifestyle as much as possible.”

After graduating high school, Sheila Baker was accepted into at a well-known liberal college located in the Pacific Northwest, attended primarily by the offspring of affluent families. Even then, feminism was the social justice ’cause du jour’ amongst bleeding-heart upper class young adults with no worldly perspective or experience. “It’s true. I identified as a feminist in college,” Baker blushingly confessed. “It’s really rather embarrassing to admit now. I marched in the marches. I blogged with the best of them. I was full of entitlement and resentment towards what I thought at the time was the source of all the world’s ills: The Patriarchy. In particular, white males. The only real exposure I had to the less fortunate was through my textbooks. Instructors basically fanned the flames by telling us that all sources of oppression and strife within’ the world were due to privileged Caucasians.

You get a bunch of impressionable white kids together who are in a rebellious frame of mind and tell them that the families they grew up with are basically responsible for everything that is wrong with the world and I can guarantee the outcome is not going to be a healthy one.”

And the horror stories don’t stop there says Sheila, who claims she has heard thousands of stories which ring similarly to her own. And far too many of those tales result in permanent damage to the woman, her personal life, and familial relationships.

Barker went on to elaborate upon one particular instance in which a woman became so wrapped up in feminism that she was disowned by her family, eventually leading to her untimely demise at the hands of an intentional overdose.

“We’ll call this woman K.C. out of respect,” Sheila began. “We were close friends in college, and even by my own admittedly very liberal standards, she was quite extreme. Always talking about how men should be castrated and put in labor camps. She updated her social media with misandrist hate speech, and even went onto violently attack her younger brother when he accidentally misgendered one of her friends.

During this time K.C. intentionally gained 200 pounds in what she called her fight against beauty stereotypes. What was once a beautiful, attractive young girl had permanently mutilated herself with facial tattoos, piercings, and morbid obesity.”

Sheila Baker will be releasing her findings in an upcoming interview with OUT Magazine, as well as a 30 state tour to sign the accompanying book which goes into even more detail as to why young women fall into the treacherous trap of liberalism, and how to reclaim their lives from commie parasites, and other damaging ideologies which prey on a misguided desire to make the world a better place, all while paving the hell."

573,7,"Ahoy, mateys! This is Cap’n Crunch speaking, the nautical adventurer who sails the high seas bringing cereal to children everywhere! I’ve had many thrilling adventures aboard my ship, the S.S. Guppy, and today I’d like to tell you about one of my favorites: The time when we got marooned and immediately began practicing cannibalism despite still having plenty of Cap’n Crunch left to eat in the cargo hold!

That’s right, kids! Yours truly feasted on men!

It happened on a fateful day I’ll never forget. My crew and I were having a spirited discussion about how Cap’n Crunch cereal stays crunchy even in milk, and we became so engrossed in this conversation that we didn’t realize that no one was manning the steering wheel. In our neglect, our boat drifted aimlessly with the wind for hours and hours until we finally ran aground atop a sandbar, leaving us stranded in the middle of the Atlantic ocean thousands of miles from the nearest port.

We had little worry of starvation, since our ship was stocked with enough cereal to last us years—from original Cap’n Crunch to Peanut Butter Crunch to limited-edition varieties such as Donut Crunch and Christmas Crunch. But despite the tremendous glut of cereal at our disposal, I recognized as the ship’s captain that we were in a survival situation, and sometimes in survival situations, extreme measures are necessary. Hence, I decided that we should immediately begin butchering crew mates and devouring their corpses.

To determine which people should be eaten, I developed a system where we’d all reach into a box of Oops! All Berries and take turns pulling out a single crunch berry. Whoever pulled out a red crunch berry first would be that night’s dinner. And so, for many days there out on the lawless sea, we delighted in a nightly bacchanal of flesh and blood, ingesting our chums one by one until we eventually remembered that we had a lifeboat on our vessel, which the three surviving members of our crew then used to safely navigate back home. Once we returned to civilization, we vowed to never eat human flesh again—a commitment we’ve mostly upheld, although I admittedly have eaten some school kids that I crunchatized for commercials.

Anyway, thanks for listening to my tale! And if you want the Cap’n’s take on the taste of human flesh, my opinion is that it’s fine. It’s basically pork, but a little worse. You’re much better off eating Cap’n Crunch cereal, which is a delicious part of a balanced breakfast!"
574,7,"Robert DeNiro isn’t much to look at in person. At 5-foot-2 and just over 140 pudgy pounds, he wears platform shoes and a mean look on his face to feel tough. We’ve all seen those videos where he does the whole “Trump is a punk” thing. It’s ridiculous. He’s like an overgrown toddler with an Oscar or two.

His outbursts will now cost him. According to our insider at Universal MGM, DeNiro’s negative image among older Americans lost him the $40 million role of a lifetime:

“Bob was on his way to his biggest payday ever when the studio called. It was Art Tubolls himself. He told Bobby that they were passing on him for the Goodfellas sequel. They’re gonna kill him off instead. Him and Liota were supposed to split $40 million up front with another $40 million guaranteed for the backend. Now they’re bringing Pesci back to life instead.”

That’s a shame, “Bob.” Maybe you should have kept your tiny self out of places it didn’t belong. Everyone knows Trump would toss you around like a rag doll and leave you a pile of mush. He’s in the best shape a president has ever been in.

DeNiro reportedly had his driver keep going, taking him north into Oregon and his private ranch on the Danube. From there he sent a statement to his agent to release when the word of his firing from the film goes public:

As usual, the liberal has nothing worthwhile to say, so he resorts to insults. It’s amazing that they think that’s acceptable in a modern, civilized society."

Kodak Black took to IG Live today to respond to the game. The game previously responded to the Kodak Black for saying some out of pocket things about Lauren London.

“Lauren London that’s baby, though. She about to be out here single. She’s finna be a whole widow out here. I’ll be the best man I can be for her. I’ll give her a whole year.

The Game then responded by saying:

Kodak Black responded today by saying that The Game can’t come for him since he used to be a “Male Stripper”, and that he used to “Shake his booty” for others in Strip Clubs.

577,7,"From PayPal to Tesla to SpaceX, Elon Musk has been one of the leading innovators of our age—a modern-day Thomas Edison ushering mankind toward a better future. And it looks like he has once again found a brilliant solution to one of mankind’s most pressing problems: Musk just announced that he is currently developing a lemon with legs that can sprint to hungry people all over the world.

Earlier today, Musk revealed that he has been working with scientists for the past three years to genetically engineer a lemon that has big, muscular human legs and can sprint in the direction of people facing starvation. When the lemon arrives, the lucky recipients can eat it, thus completely eliminating their poverty.

Musk gave the world a glimpse into the amazing project by tweeting out a video of a lemon with human legs stumbling around a parking garage with the caption, “Just a little something I’ve been working on.” Although the lemon still has trouble balancing and can only sprint for five miles at a time before collapsing from exhaustion, Musk says he hopes the lemon will be able to sprint for up to 2,000 miles at a time by the end of this year.

The SpaceX founder has been working with the best engineers and scientists in Silicon Valley and says that initial tests of the lemon with legs have been horrible, but that the thousands of problems they’re encountering will probably go away on their own without anybody doing anything. One of the most pressing issues is that the lemon does not have any eyes, so in order to successfully sprint toward a starving person, that person must constantly scream at the top of their lungs so that the lemon knows which way to sprint.

Another difficulty Musk and his team have faced is that creating a lemon with human legs required murdering an honest, hard-working man in order to harvest his DNA. Musk says that he did not like murdering the man, but that sometimes murder is the only way to get fruit that has powerful human legs. He also notes that, despite some early production challenges, the lemon with legs is already generating serious excitement: The project has attracted swarms of investors from Silicon Valley, and venture capitalists have reportedly provided upwards of $2.6 billion in funding for the project so far.

A handful of vocal detractors have criticized Musk’s lemon with legs project by claiming that a single lemon cannot provide a starving person with enough nutrition to survive, but Musk has dismissed these naysayers by claiming that they are all pedophiles. Check and mate!

This is absolutely brilliant. Only someone as ingenious as Elon Musk could think of such an elegant solution to a daunting problem like world hunger. We can’t wait to see this lemon sprinting all over the place providing much-needed food to struggling people around the globe!

UPDATE: According to new reports, Elon Musk has murdered his lemon with legs after it kicked him in the groin."
578,7,"Cloud computing refers to the scalable and elastic internet-based services that providers offer to many external customers. Today, most business people are not storing data and applications on their desktop computers or local networks. They are now opting for the cloud – a shared network of database servers and scalable applications hosted in many locations around the globe. Remote file management and software-as-a-service are among cloud computing applications. Here are some of the reason you need to use cloud-based software for your business.

As a business owner, you possibly know the benefits of backing up your business and personal data. Without data backup, you are likely to lose everything if a system failure or any other disaster happened. Apart from helping you simplify the process of updating your data automatically as you work, cloud storage creates many copies of the data off-site where it will remain safe from theft, natural disasters and malfunction.

Technology allows business owners to make fully functional offices, which they can access with their smartphone devices or personal computers. The cloud serves better in this area because business owners can access and sync their personal data and that of their businesses from any place. As a result, they can move with their office to any place and access information at any time. They can also request files from their employees.

After you start using cloud computing, you will realise that the business operations will be more flexible. You can outsource the routine IT operations such as the data backup/storage and start focusing on the main operations like website design and development. A quick example, you can rely on Hoxro.co.uk, which use cloud-based storage to develop software programs in the UK and focus on the value-added components of your business. With cloud computing, group collaboration will be easier. You can rely on freelance software engineers from all parts of the world if they can use virtual meetings and document sharing to collaborate on your projects.

Businesses are able to avoid upfront costs associated with installing or purchasing hardware systems and software applications. This is more helpful for businesses that operate on tight budgets. They can now rent storage space and software applications if necessary and avoid the risks associated with the installation of expensive systems only to realise that they do not match the needs of their company. Cloud computing will turn the fixed costs of your business into variable costs. You will pay for what you need solely and leave what you do not need therefore reducing the fixed overhead costs.

High-speed internet connections facilitate faster transfer of data and real-time communication between business and customers. An employee can log in from his/her home and communicate with the work colleagues in a different time zone. Cloud computing provides unlimited storage space and will free up your desktop processing capacity and storage. System crash or a lightning strike could easily destroy the business data you have stored in the local network but it will not affect any that you have stored in the cloud. With cloud computing, you will reduce energy costs due to the associated sharing of resources.

Cloud computing has several challenges. Use of cloud to store critical information and prevent loses in cases of a major network outage. For example, email service outages might leave your customers without the communication tools they need. Privacy is another concern because some criminal elements might access your personal data. Some companies are reluctant of using the cloud due to security issues such as information theft, computer hacking and unauthorised access to their sensitive data."

A person using that pseudonym claimed on his blog that he caused the problem, by manipulating the system that allows Amazon customers to flag objectionable content. “Here’s a nice piece I like to call “how to cause moral outrage from the entire Internet in ten lines of code,” he states at the top of his post.

Amazon Monday afternoon posted its own explanation, which contradicts Weev’s. The company described it as an internal glitch, “an embarrassing and ham-fisted cataloging error” that did not single out gay-related books but affected a number of other categories–more 57,000 books in all.

581,7,"Representatives from the Catholic community have been urged to come out and denounce convicted child molester and Catholic George Pell.Cardinal Pell, until very recently the third most important Catholic in the world, was found guilty of raping underage boys and has been sent to prison. Despite this, many important figures on the fringes of the Catholic community are refusing to criticise him, and in some cases are even refusing to believe that what he did was wrong.Former Australian Prime Minister John Howard insisted that Pell is “a person of both high intelligence and exemplary character” and maintained that his conviction on child sexual abuse charges doesn’t “alter my opinion of the Cardinal”.The fact that a former Prime Minister of Australia would insist that child rape is OK as long as it is done by a Catholic just shows how hopelessly radicalised many once respected figures have now become.Gordon Renfield of Essex Road, Islington, an atheist who leans if anything towards the Jedi persuasion, said he couldn’t understand why Catholics refused to condemn people like Pell. “I know it might just be a few bad apples,” he explained today, “And no-one is saying that ALL Catholics are up to this sort of thing, but can anyone tell me why they can’t just stand up and say that people like this are evil?”“I’m not denominationalist, but it does rather make me tar them all with the same brush, I’m afraid to say.”The Pope, meanwhile, refused to comment on Pell’s conviction until an appeal is heard. Just to play that back – the leader of the Catholic church is giving his deputy the benefit of the doubt after a conviction for child molestation.“I tell you,” insisted Renfield, “I swear they’re all as bad as each other.”"
582,7,"Tucking into the foods of our childhood can conjure up fond memories of home. But while some regional delicacies remain firmly local, others travel to other parts of the country or even the world.

Mary-Ellen Johnson recalls the warmth of her favourite winter meal - a rectangle of steamed suet pastry encasing squares of fatless smoked bacon and slices of onion.

As one of eight children her family was ""very poor"" but ""fed well"" by her mother, who often turned to the Sussex bacon and onion pudding.

""The foods of childhood remind me of being home with mum and my many siblings and it brings back many good memories,"" said Ms Johnson, who grew up in Hove.

""I'm now gluten-free and I really miss eating this with mashed potatoes, green vegetables and onion gravy.""

According to the 64-year-old, none of her neighbours in Essex where she lives now have ever heard of the dish.

Nor has she ever encountered it on her travels around England.

But blogger Lucy Stableford-Grieve has been using the same ingredients in Kent, to make what she calls a bacon and onion roly poly.

""My mum and dad remember it as one of their favourite school dinners in the late fifties and early sixties,"" said the 37-year-old.

""I was looking through my mum's old recipe books and found the traditional steaming method.

""I muddled through and adapted it for the oven and now I make it for my kids and they love it.""

Similar recipes like Berkshire bacon pudding and Romany bacon pudding can be found around England - so how have they travelled to other parts of the country?

Cookery historian, professor Roland Rotherham, said the steamed or boiled pudding can be traced back to Roman times.

It was easy to cook, tasty, and required minimal amounts of water, which was collected from wells and brooks then boiled.

The fact it was later adopted by the Anglo Saxons is typical of the fact that people take their favourite dishes with them when they move to pastures new.

""These are the tastes we travel with and introduce to where we settle,"" he said, which could explain why variations of them pop up across the country.

The Staffordshire oatcake is a prime example - not only has it crossed county lines, homesick expats made headlines when they started cooking them up in the United States.

There's a reason for that, says Stoke-on-Trent resident Michael Collins - they're ""food from the gods"".

His love for the savoury pancake started 60 years ago, when he would roll it up and dip it in bacon fat for breakfast.

""It tasted lovely,"" he said nostalgically. ""Almost better than the bacon itself.""

Food writer Xanthe Clay described the humble foodstuff - made from oatmeal, flour and yeast - as a ""a wonderful thing"".

""Who needs sissy tortillas or burritos or wraps when you can have a proper sustaining Staffordshire oatcake?

""[It] can be filled with cheese or whatever you like, and eaten hot or cold... plus they are full of lovely slow-burning carbs, and delicious too.""

Nearby, in the West Midlands, a meatball made of pig offal encased in part of the animal's stomach is a regular sight on the region's menus.

But despite being an ""archetypal Black Country food"" it's not to everyone's tastes, said David Cowing, from Sutton Coldfield.

""I came from the Lake District in 1972 and I remember being introduced to faggots by a local and absolutely loving them for their rich flavour.

""For years I had no idea what the ingredients were. We had them every year for about 10 years at a school summer camp I was involved in.

""Not all the kids were as keen to eat them as me so there were always extra helpings.""

Michelin starred chef Glynn Purnell is a ""big advocate"" of the divisive dish.

He said the recent surge in ""nose-to-tail"" eating - a movement which looks to cook the whole animal rather than focus on choice cuts - has seen faggots popping up at eateries across the UK.

""It is estimated that tens of millions of faggots are eaten every year, so they can't be that unpopular,"" he reasoned.

The foodie, from Solihull, gave faggots their five minutes of fame when he served a twist on the meal - which is often served with mash and peas - on BBC Two's Great British Menu.

""What can be quite scary is the thought of a lung, heart and kidney staring at you - it's enough to make any meat eater a veggie.

""But faggots turn that ... into a delicious, rich, moist, sophisticated piece of cooking.

""The strong flavour of offal and unusual, challenging textures can be a delight to the culinary adventurer.""

A dish that has not quite made the leap on to the nation's plate is the oddly named groaty dick.

Prof Rotherham said it may have originally arrived with Welsh ""navvies digging out the cuttings for the canal systems"".

But the thick meat porridge - sometimes known as groaty pudding - found its way to the Black Country, where it is still made at the Black Country Living Museum's bonfire night.

Made from oat husks, leeks, onions stock and cheap cuts of beef, its appeal once lay in the fact it was ""calorie heavy, cheap to make and could be left on the range for hours while out at work or looking after children,"" said curator Grant Bird.

The dish's stodgy structure also made it a portable meal for the working classes, said chef Keith Floyd, who visited the area in 1988 to learn how to make the traditional recipe.

""In the olden days they'd cook this so thick, let it get cold, then cut it like a cake...the man would take a slice of this in his satchel to work and munch on it.""

But the quality of the ingredients and general appearance has meant that unlike faggots, it has not been hailed a culinary delight further afield.

""Today it's seen as quite low grade food,"" said Mr Bird, diplomatically.

""From a flavour profile it's not brilliant and it looks horrible.""

So is the movement of recipes from one place to another simply a matter of taste?

Not so, says Prof Rotherham.

""The reason that many recipes remained regional is down to the fact that many people did not travel, even after the Industrial Revolution.

""The recipes stayed within certain boundaries. Those that did travel brought the food with them.""

But Ms Clay believes that could be about to change because we are in the midst of a regional delicacy resurgence.

""I think we are becoming even more interested in local foods because of gastro-tourism.

""People travel to places because of the food we can't eat anywhere else and that's brilliant.

""The more we explore these dishes the more we will be going through old recipes and bringing up old memories.""

Who knows what might end up on our plate next.

583,7,"Iraqi Christian Who Risks Life To Attend Mass Not Super Concerned About Bad Church Music Right Now

Tel Keppe, Iraq–As Iraqi Christian Raghda Ablahad and three other family members risked their lives to attend Sunday Mass in Tel Keppe, Iraq, this week, Ablahad reported to family members that Catholics around the world were, at that very moment, “no joke,” complaining about female altar servers, as well as the music at Mass.

Ablahad told family members that, though she, herself, was not a big fan of the music played at her church, that she had decided to spend her free time on the “little things,” like finding a less-conspicuous route to church, and watching her back for radical Muslims looking to slay an infidel for Allah.

When asked when she had decided to stop focusing on the bad church music and the fact that her church had female altar servers, Ablahad told EOTT: “If I had to take a guess, that would probably be the moment I saw Muslim militants pointing guns at my child’s head…yes…I think that was the moment.”"
584,7,"The whole world is watching today as President Trump travels to the United Kingdom to meet with England’s Royal Family, and the stakes of this diplomatic visit have never been higher. The U.S. State Department is hoping that President Trump can convince Queen Elizabeth to stop developing nuclear weapons in her attic.

This meeting is a critical opportunity for Trump and Queen Elizabeth to diplomatically resolve this major threat to global peace.

For the past three decades, Queen Elizabeth has been frequently condemned by the international community for tinkering away night and day in her attic, developing nuclear weapons that the Royal Family could launch from the Buckingham Palace lawn. President Trump is expected to meet with the Queen at a royal banquet during his visit in order to try to use peaceful yet stern negotiating tactics to persuade her to stop researching how to build nuclear warheads on the internet and sending her husband Prince Philip out to the hardware store to buy tools and sheet metal.

President Trump definitely has his work cut out for him. Queen Elizabeth has refused to denuclearize for years, despite threats of military intervention from nations like the United States and Great Britain. She has repeatedly appeared on British television to announce that she “cannot wait to have the bomb.”

The Queen also has a history of subterfuge and deception when it comes to the Royal Family’s nuclear program. In 1994, Queen Elizabeth promised that she had stopped trying to build nuclear weapons, but since then, hundreds of spy satellite photos have captured images of the Queen walking into Buckingham Palace carrying Tesco shopping bags filled with enriched uranium, and officials believe that Queen Elizabeth may have a fully functioning nuclear arsenal within five years.

State Department officials say that this visit to London might be the president’s last, best chance to use diplomacy instead of violence to defuse the threat to world peace posed by Queen Elizabeth and the nuclear arsenal in her attic. Here’s hoping that President Trump will be able to use his skills as a negotiator to get Queen Elizabeth to denuclearize Buckingham Palace in a peaceful and efficient manner. The fate of the world may depend on it!"
585,7,"It was a horrible week for the English. Two of the nation’s most revered icons were brought down a peg when a cache of hardcore naked pictures was released on the internet. With frightening clarity, they reveal the ruddy pale flesh so common in this cloudy, unpleasant land. While the English are often thought of as Europe’s most civilized people, this sudden surge of British porn could certainly damage that reputation permanently.

Homosexual Pop star Elton John, the gay musician behind such hits as Daniel and Honky Tonky, appeared in one snapshot with his buttocks in all their outrageous fullness, pert and robust like a glazed ham. The radical homosexual performer is well known for his x-rated antics, and for many observers this latest stunt only underscores the underlying immorality of contemporary rock music. Unsurprisingly, hardcore gay porn sites like “The Sword” fawned, drooled and titillated themselves over the photos, lusting with inexplicable salaciousness over every detail of Sir John’s porcine nudity.

In another photo released by the gay gossip site TMZ, Price Harry looks taut and sinewy, muscled and tender. It’s an offensive sight that poses more questions than it answers. While the relationship between the Prince and Sir Elton is not exactly known, rumors that the two are “familiar” have circulated on the internet for years. Indeed, Elton was a close friend to Harry’s mother, Princess Diana and even performed a few tunes at her funeral.

In the gay subculture, many younger men are attracted to older men. They call the youths “twinks” and the older men “sugar daddies” or “daddy bears.” The sexual acts that such couples engage in are uniquely foul, though there are literally thousands of videos on the internet depicting such scenarios in disgusting, infuriating and flamboyant detail."

Dr. Ford Chappel, who has a doctorate in theology, claims that his exhaustive 10-year study proves that gay people are really heterosexuals who choose to be gay. More shockingly, Dr. Chappel claims that we are predisposed to be Chrisitan.

“I didn’t start out to prove anything,” said Dr. Chappel speaking at a Liberty University press conference. “I just let the will of the Lord guide me along the way. And let me tell you, this is further proof that if you let Him guide you, along with the grace of Jesus Christ, He will lead you to the truth.”

The 10-year study involved 420 students from the Christian evangelical Liberty University. Sponsored by the Falwell Family Foundation and Family Research Council, the study sought to determine the origins of being gay and Christian according to a prospectus released by Dr. Chappel. Both 501c3 non-profits decline to comment for this article.

Garret Greg, of the San Francisco-based civil rights group, Stonewall Information Coalition, said it has nothing to do with any of Dr. Chappel’s findings.

 

 

 

 “Let’s forget the implicit and explicit bigotry of the Liberty University study. Not to mention its lack or complete absence of scientific rigor,” said Mr. Greg speaking with the San Francisco-based KRON-TV news. “The fact of the matter is it doesn’t matter if it’s genetic or not or whether someone is predisposed or not to be straight or gay or whatever. It’s a matter of treating everyone equally regardless of their orientation. Clearly, these idiots are trying to influence the law and reduce citizen’s rights.”

According to Liberty University president Jerry Falwell, Jr., Dr. Chappel’s research is instrumental in both bring God back into America and establishing the university as a leading think tank for LGBTQ studies.

“I am so proud of the godly work of Dr. Chappel,” said Mr. Falwell during a Fox News interview following the release of the study. “I’ve spoken with the president about it, and he believes, as I certainly do, that the Lord is telling us something; something that demands real action to bring His Kingdom to America.”

The White House denies that Reverend Falwell reached out to President Trump regarding the study."

Before anything else, I must apologize to the First Family of the United States’ and all their guests who attended their annual White House Easter Egg Roll, which I attended, as always, on Monday, April the 6th. As many of you know, there was an incident and controversy that took place during the annual White House “Easter Egg Roll” celebration when hundreds of children, participating in the Easter egg hunt portion of the day’s activities discovered hundreds of plastic Easter eggs not containing candy or small gifts, but quotes from the Islamic Quran and the Hadith.

This was an unfortunate incident that made for a very uncomfortable day and ruined Easter for a lot of families invited to the White House. And I, your Easter Bunny, was the culprit who put those pieces of fortune cookie-like quotes in those Easter eggs. Despite what many have suspected, it was not President Obama or anyone from the White House who did this. It was me.

The fact of the matter is, my former Christian followers and those who looked to me as a symbol of Jesus Christ’s resurrection, I am converting to Islam. Easter 2015 will be the last one your beloved Easter Bunny will spend as a furry, friendly, loveable, inadvertent conduit for Christianity and its holiest day.

I wish I were joking, but facts are the facts. And I have found those “facts” of how to strive, hop, hide, eat, worship, and live my daily life as a giant, bucktoothed rodent living in a crumbling, hedonistic, all-things-relevant, gargantuan castle of decadence called “Judeo−Christian Western Modernity”. For I have found Islam!

I was introduced into American culture from German immigrants in the 18th Century. As Easter after Easter went on, I began noticing that my popularity grew throughout the late 19th and early 20th centuries, and by the midst of the Cold War, I was an undisputed icon. I was a loveable hero...what the...? ...A hero? A hero to whom, to what? —I’m a giant, mutant, bunny, the result of inbreeding from my hedonistic commie clan of self-indulging white-tailed tarts, now the celeb-du-jour representing the life, cause, crusade, message and ultimate horrific execution and holy resurrection of one of the three prophets. Think about that: from being plucked from Germany’s dense Black Forest to now being the icon of Christians during Easter.... I am saddened and personally humiliated to realize that I was becoming the “face”, the “physical embodiment” of Christ and his rebirth and great tale of woe and triumph, something which Islam does not traditionally project or encourage (a physical, visual being to represent any god, let alone the true and one God —Allah).

Thus I grew depressed. Maybe being over 200 years old is a little late to have a mid-life crisis, but I found myself in one throughout the last few years. I felt taken for granted, belittled, only called upon to give snotty, ungrateful rug-rats stupid gifts and be thought of only once a year, many times by supposed Christians who only think of or took their “faith” seriously twice a year (Christmas and Easter, which I’m sorry, but is bullshit if you claim you are one truly “devout”). I felt I was a joke...a big, giant, deformed furry, bucktoothed fucking joke! I became the pawn of simply another grand, corporate−concocted reason for shallow, superficial “ pseudo-believers” to buy shit they don’t need, and for me to bend over and grant people’s material wishes in the name of religion...instead of fighting for a religion, fighting for something greater than me, greater than humanity itself! ...Now I have found that “something”.

I began studying more of Islam after the Boston Marathon Bombings two years ago, and looked back on our failed experience in Iraq. How could so few disheveled, seemingly haphazardly banded Islamic “insurgents” bog down the mightiest military force on earth, I wondered. That question kept running through my meager rodent mind as the U.S. began to withdraw its forces and a new insurgency rose across North Africa and especially in Syria. I bought a Quran, along with other sacred Islamic writs and studied them, all while doing my duty each Easter to gift Christian children in the West with little presents and my presence. But my presence began shifting allegiance over the past two years, and now I must renounce the religion I was born and raised to represent. Your “Easter Bunny” is now the “Islam Bunny”.

Now I understand why such a small group of Muslims caused the greatest powers in the world so much consternation, fear, havoc, obsession, military and intelligence expenditures, dominate their news, rule everyday conversations and the political scene, and increasingly, bring death. Islam is going to win because Islam is stronger, period. Islam doesn’t put up with the “live and let live”, “everyone’s pleasure is relative”, “to each his own”, “if it feels good, do it” bullshit mentality that has taken over the West and especially America over the last 50 years. When you “submit”, you submit, period.

There are no ifs, ands, or buts in Islam. What is written is written, and must be followed, or else there will be consequences, unlike in Christianity where one can be forgiven for their sins. And to where does forgiveness ultimately lead? —it leads to a “get out of jail free card”, that’s what; just a means to do the same sinful behaviors again. Under the Imams and the dictates by the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him), there is room for forgiveness in Islam, but not before the sinner is punished, suffers and repents, and convinces his family, community and his Imam that he sincerely, in his heart, understands what and why he did was wrong, and will not commit it again. Then there are those sins where the sinner must pay the ultimate price. That’s another thing I like about Islam. Christianity has just become too limp-wristed, let’s face it. Christianity has lost its balls, man. BALLS! And being a rabbit that screws its brains out and has a whole new litter of new bunnies running around by the end of every week, I like “balls”, in every sense.

Good God / Allah, just look how Christians have let us Muslims overrun Europe and establish “no go zones”; mini caliphates, and on average —particularly in Europe— sentence a Muslim who is found plotting an attack on Christians to just a few years in jail or simply deported. You think the Knights Templar would have put up with such bullshit?! Ehh, nope! That’s because they were Christians with balls. BALLS, I SAY! If only Christians hadn’t grown so soft due to the luxuries their rich societies afforded them over the years then maybe they wouldn’t be in the Islam-vs-Western modernity struggle they’re facing now in their own countries today. A religion that preaches against decadence and sin, yet forgives those whom indulge in it without first inflicting pain and suffering on to them is a religion destined for failure. Combine Christianity’s weakness in the face of Islam’s strength (some would call it inhuman brutality or nihilism or whatever) within increasingly secular societies that condone or excuse any behavior of its people out of some obscure sense of guilt, repentance, of the harsh mandates they imposed on people a long time ago, Christianity has also adopted that guilt, and so now teeters over the cliff of vanishing. Jesus (and Muhammad!), why would I want to be a representative of “that sort” of Christianity and the whatever-feels-good-do-it secular societies its flaccidness has become fused to?

I want to be strong. I’m a damn mutant rabbit, for Heaven’s sake! —why wouldn’t I want to be a member of a strong, growing religion, rather than an increasingly meek, diminishing one? So yes, I admit, a little bit of wanting to be on the winning side of “holy history” has factored into my conversion. Heh —sue me!

Now of course there are silly rules I must follow as a Muslim, now that I have worked my last Easter and have formally “submitted”, and many of my new Muslim friends find them silly too. Like pork, for one thing... Damn, do you know how many Muslims have tried pork and loved the shit out of it?! Millions! Who can’t love bacon?! I’ll bet my furry bunny balls no one, even if they’re allergic to pork can’t admit that well-cooked bacon is better than licking strawberry syrup off Kate Upton’s ass after a hot shower! But do Muslims make eating pork a regular thing? Do we fast for days or bow towards Mecca and stick our fuzzy butts in the air five times a day (come to find out, my butt is one of the least hairy I’ve seen among my new Muslim brethren yet. Go figure!) because we believe lightening will strike us or Allah wreak vengeance on us if we don’t? Of course not! These things are not what make us Muslim, but help prove our loyalty to Allah and his Prophet (peace be upon him); they are tests and tasks that are supposed to be ridiculous, yet one must recognize in order to prove oneself in accordance and obedience to something greater than yourself and everyone you love. Do you all remember what doing things like that was like in order to prove your devotion to a Higher Power and something greater than yourselves, my former Christian brothers?? Or do you not even have the time anymore to Google it on your stupid “smart phones” to find out in between sexting each other and playing Candy Crush? Like, shiiiiiiiiiit...being a Muslim isn’t about stupid fasts and abstaining from drinking (although other drugs are cool...a good snort of pure “Panama Paradise” and whoo, baby, you won’t be feeling your face for a month!!), it’s about doing silly, inane things and abiding by ludicrous rules in order to prove loyalty, dedication, temperance, and love for something far greater and superior than you or any earthly power. Remember that, Christianity?!

And yes, there are those unfortunate incidents in Islam (which there are many sects and degrees of, just to remind you) involving animal and child abuse, spousal abuse and the occasional public hanging, beheading, honor killing, crucifixion, castration, limb severing, and lighting people on fire that gives us a bad name. Oh, and suicide bombers and “lone wolf” attackers that just are a really big pain in Allah’s holy ass. Just look at the mayhem in the Middle East today: Muslims fighting mostly other Muslims. Disgraceful! That’s another reason I “submitted” —to have a former Christian icon and celebrity among their ranks may help bring peace to the poor, fractioned, wooly, infighting buggers. Maybe I’ll help unite the factions of Muslims and stop this bloodshed! Maybe I can do some good for these folks, unlike among Christians, who have enough sense to not kill each other by the bushel every damned day. Dear Allah, I could be a force for good and peace among Muslims, instead of the two-bit, materialistic lackey of a fallen religion I’ve been for Allah-knows how long; a religion that by its very dictates, “turn the other cheek” for example, invites negligence, weakness (personal and collective), timidity, over-heightened sense of forgiveness, apology for sin and disrespect, and worst of all, self-pity. In Islamic societies, when something goes wrong, it’s never our fault, never, always someone else’s, and usually someone or some “force” non-Islamic or not of whomever’s sect of Islam. We’re totally guiltless for whatever woe befalls us, don’t you know?

So, basically, there you have it, folks. This is your Easter Bunny; your 200-plus-year-old fluffy, severely orthodontically-challenged rabbit with elephantiasis signing off on Christianity and the hedonistic societies its ingrained and growing weaknesses has allowed to corrode from within. Islam stands for things distinct, sharp, inflexible, discipline and order. I am converting to Islam because I don’t want to be representing a religion that is, as I have come to realize, innately self-destructive, and via its humility allows outside influences to come in and destroy it. People bash “Islamists” as being throw-backs to the 9th Century. And maybe they’re right. But at least in 800 A.D. there were distinct rules, and when you disrespected them, it meant your ass.

I’m not joining Islam to blow anyone up or take part in the annihilation of billions of infidels, either. Nope. Beheadings and flaming human torches ain’t for me. I just want to be part of something hard, that needs hard work to be part of, every day, multiple times a day, and demands adherence to and from the well-meaning, the devout, the loyal, and devoted, no matter how bizarre its dictates demand (depending on which sect of Islam I happen to like the most).

So goodbye, Christianity. I’m happy to have made your live-by-moment-to-moment-lives a little brighter on just one day of each year you only care to recognize that you are indeed Christians. ...Too bad, huh? Take good care, as well as your iPhones can tell you to. Goodbye, former brothers and friends. I just need stability.

UPDATE: According to the Al Jazeera news network’s office in northern Syria, the Easter Bunny was promptly beheaded, skinned, and eaten upon meeting with representatives of the “Islamic State” (ISIS) early this morning.

590,7,"ATLANTA, GA – In an effort to better encourage patients to do their breathing exercises, a newly-designed incentivized spirometer will pay patients $50 per deep breath – that’s right: cold, hard, cash – including a bonus of $100 every time they hit 1500.

“One of the most common complaints in patient satisfaction surveys had to with incentive spirometers: what was the incentive?” explained respiratory therapist Artie Blood-Gas, who carries his own incentivized spirometer to make a little cash on the side. “Patients were never motivated to use them. All they said was, what’s in it for me? Not only are they motivated, heck, I’m motivated too.”

An incentivized spirometer works exactly like a conventional incentive spirometer: the patient inhales, holds their breath for 5 seconds, and exhales. The only difference is with every breath the patient gets a cash payout.

“Hell yeah, there’s a whole lot of incentive!!” said patient Jackson Jones, who has been inhaling and exhaling like crazy over the past several hours. His bed is overflowing with an unholy amount of cash, and not a single collapsed alveolus exists in his body. “This is way better than the slots in Vegas! I got you, alveoli, I got you!!”

One incredibly motivated patient managed to move the gauge past 3000 in a single breath, after which her incentivized spirometer spit out an entire gold bar.

Blood-Gas is pretty sure he has a respiratory alkalosis going on based on his incentivized hyperventilation. “Cha-CHING! Thanks to these new devices,” he said, “atelectasis will be a thing of the past.”

In other news, several interns were caught in a back alley using dozens of incentivized spirometers to help pay off their student loans."
591,7,"Berlin, Germany — The German government announced yesterday that it was banning all recordings of Orson Welles’ 1938 radio drama version of War of the Worlds for fear it would incite unrest among their population and because its ‘fake news.’ The announcement is the first action taken by the Berlin government in its war on fake news and coincides with Facebook’s announcement that the world’s largest social network would enable German users to flag potentially false stories.

“The War of the Worlds” is an episode of the American radio drama anthology series The Mercury Theatre on the Air. It was performed as a Halloween episode of the series on Sunday, October 30, 1938. The first two-thirds of the one-hour broadcast was presented as a series of simulated news bulletins, which suggested an actual alien invasion by Martians was currently in progress. In the days following the adaptation, widespread outrage was expressed in the media. The program’s news-bulletin format was described as deceptive by some newspapers and public figures, leading to an outcry against the perpetrators of the broadcast and calls for regulation and censorship. Following the radio broadcast of “War of the Worlds,” many newspapers ironically claimed that the drama had caused wide-spread panic. This led to the producers of the radio program to conclude that Americans are dangerously stupid.

Unlike the United States, Germany has much more conservative speech laws and citizens and institutions don’t benefit from the same kinds of protections many Americans take for granted. Germany’s decision to actively censor Internet content comes on the heels of allegations that Russia hacked the recent elections and influenced the outcome in favor of Donald Trump. German government officials have expressed concern that misinformation on the Internet could influence the country’s parliamentary election this year. German Justice Minister Heiko Maas has also repeatedly warned about fake news on Facebook, and called on the firm to respect the country’s defamation laws, which are stricter than in the US.

“It is clear that any broadcast of War of the Worlds without the proper context would lead to wide-spread unrest,” said German Federal Minister of Justice and Consumer Protection Heiko Maas speaking about the this first action. “As we learned from 1938, such falsehoods can stir up hysteria and cause people to act irrationally, so its better they not hear such deceptions.”

In a new law passed in December ahead of the German elections, Facebook could be fined over $500,000 for each fake news post it allows on its network. Responding to this, the social media giant announced that it is working with several fact checkers, notably the US-based comedy and women’s fashion site Snopes.com to ‘vet’ fake-news flagged articles. Facebook fact checkers must sign up to a code of principles to take part. Some of the fact-checking requirements include having a dense or no sense of humor and oddly the ability to spot easily spot fake news “because I know it when I see it.”

Facebook stock has dropped in after-hours trading by 14.3% as analysts say the fake news and its advertisers make up as much as 25% of operating revenue."

593,7,"We’ve gone long enough as a society letting privileged people off the hook for their bullshit, and it’s time to get real: Cap’n Crunch was only forgiven for the “Oops! All Berries” debacle because he’s a straight white man. Period.

There, we said it.

In case you need a refresher, back in 1997, Cap’n Crunch mistakenly released a cereal that was 100% Crunch Berries with none of the yellow square pieces that consumers had come to expect. It was a disastrous and costly error—and one that a woman or person of color would’ve never made, as women and people of color would’ve taken every precaution to ensure the correct ratio of Crunch Berries to yellow squares, knowing that even the most minor misstep could be attributed to incompetence or an inability to handle the stress of the job. Yet the Cap’n never faced any consequences for the blunder because his status as a powerful white male shielded him from accountability. And not only did he emerge unscathed, but it also wasn’t long before he was once again being trusted with major projects like Cozmic Crunch, proving that he, like so many other straight white men, was above reproach.

See, when a straight white man makes a mistake, society tends to dismiss it as a fluke and just continues acting like he’s a genius. But good luck getting such benefit of the doubt if you’re a WOC ship captain—one small slip-up and people will never let you sail around teaching kids about breakfast cereal ever again. It’s an outrageous double standard that we must no longer tolerate.

The most damning aspect of all this is that the Cap’n didn’t even consider resigning after letting the “All Berries” fiasco happen under his watch, whereas a POC in the same position would’ve been shit-canned immediately. That’s privilege in action, and hopefully, Cap’n Crunch will one day take a step back and realize all the ways he’s benefited in life simply because of how he was born. Because you see, Mr. Crunch, “oops” is not an apology, and it certainly doesn’t vindicate you of your failures. Chances are you have no idea how to make amends for your missteps considering you’ve never had to, but it’s time that you learn.

It is shameful and unjust that we live in a society where a straight white man can hand people boxes of cereal full of just Crunch Berries and expect to be told “good job,” but that is nonetheless the reality. And if you think we’re being unfair calling out Cap’n Crunch like this, just remember all the qualified, passionate candidates waiting in the wings for a job like his who aren’t straight white male sea captains but are just as capable, if not more so. We’re willing to bet that if they were given a crack, they wouldn’t make the same kinds of mistakes Cap’n Crunch has—yet even if they did, we’d get more than an insincere “oops” from them every time."

597,7,"The U.S. government warn of three cases in Florida of people affected by the so-called “mosquito chirulí,” able to make a woman pregnant with just a single bite. The cases have been located in Miami, Tallahassee, and Palm Beach. and those affected have been quarantined while the cases are investigated.

The existence of this mosquito was known at the end of 2016 in Uganda and Kenya, but never before have there been cases outside these countries. It is a mosquito that has mutated and is able to impregnate a women via a very specific set of circumstances, one that requires no sperm to fertilize the ovum in fertile women. There is information that this mosquito has been responsible for more than 2,000 pregnancies in Africa.

It is unknown how it was possible for the “chirulí mosquito” to reach the United States, but the authorities are already taking the necessary measures to prevent more cases from occurring. An appeal is made to all women of childbearing age who feel the bite of a mosquito to go immediately to their doctor to receive the Plan B, morning after pill."

ENGLAND—England has reluctantly ceded control of their country over to Donald Trump after the visiting US president was given a sword by a strange woman lying in a pond.

Trump was walking by the lake, taking in the beautiful sights of the English countryside, when the woman emerged from the surface of the waters, her arm clad in the purest shimmering samite. Trump began to bellow at her.

""Hey, very fine woman over there!"" he shouted. ""I very much appreciate English girls. Maybe the best girls in the world. Great teeth. How'd you like a tour of the White House sometime? You should see my office, it's literally an oval."" Trump then attempted to wade out to her to continue their conversation, but the frightened lady of the lake tossed a sword in his direction to ward him off before disappearing.

""Have it your way!"" he called out as he walked away, Excalibur in tow, his hosts in shock as they realized they now had to bend the knee to Donald Trump.

Political analysts attempted to point out that supreme executive power derives from a mandate from the masses, not from some farcical aquatic ceremony, and that just because a watery tart throws a sword at you, that doesn't mean that you're a king. But Trump ordered them to be quiet."
599,7,"The dangers to journalists in Russia have been well known since the early 1990s but concern over the number of unsolved killings soared after Anna Politkovskaya's murder in Moscow on 7 October 2006. While international monitors mentioned a dozen deaths, some sources within Russia talked of over two hundred fatalities.[1] The evidence has since been examined and documented in two reports, published in Russian and English, by international organizations.[citation needed] These revealed a basic confusion in terminology that explained the seemingly enormous numerical discrepancy: statistics of premature death among journalists (from work accidents, crossfire incidents, and purely criminal or domestic cases of manslaughter) were repeatedly equated with the much smaller number of targeted (contract) killings or work-related murders. The Remembrance Day of Journalists Killed in the Line of Duty in Russia is observed on 15 December every year.

Among international monitors, the figures quoted for deaths of journalists in Russia have varied, sometimes considerably. There are several explanations. Firstly, certain organisations are concerned with all aspects of safety in news gathering so the International Federation of Journalists and the International News Safety Institute also record accidents that have occurred at work.[2] Secondly, some monitoring bodies include only fatalities in crossfire and dangerous assignments and those murders where they feel sure of the motive behind the lethal attack and can with confidence lobby the appropriate government; the Committee to Protect Jornalists (CPJ) adopts this approach. Thirdly, the term ""journalist"" is used by monitors as a general term to cover many different occupations within the media. Some include support staff, others do not.

In any list of deaths, compiled by monitors inside or outside the country, Russia ranks near the top for deaths. When the killing began, the brief First Chechen War took numerous journalists' lives from within Chechnya and abroad. There were also increased peacetime deaths of journalists elsewhere in the Russian Federation.

Those deliberately targeted for their work tended to be reporters, correspondents, and editors. In Russia many directors of new regional TV and radio stations have been murdered[3][4] but some of these deaths are thought to relate to conflicting business interests. Photographers and cameramen are vulnerable in crossfire situations, such as the October 1993 days in Moscow and the armed conflict in the North Caucasus.

2009 reports on deaths of journalists in Russia

In June 2009, a wide-ranging investigation by the International Federation of Journalists into the deaths of journalists in Russia was published. At the same time, the IFJ launched an online database[5][6] which documents over three hundred deaths and disappearances since 1993. Both the report Partial Justice[7] (Russian version: Частичное правосудие[8]) and the database depend on the information gathered in Russia over the last 16 years by the country's own media monitors: the Glasnost Defense Foundation and the Center for Journalism in Extreme Situations.

In September, in the report Justice, the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) repeated its conclusion that Russia was one of the deadliest countries in the world for journalists and added that it remains among the worst at solving their murders. Journalists died or were killed, the CPJ argued, because of the work they were doing and only one case has led to a partially successful prosecution.

Following Russia's media monitors, the IFJ database of deaths and disappearances in Russia takes into account the entire range of media occupations and every degree of uncertainty as to the motive for many of the attacks. It also allows for selection and analysis. It classifies the way in which a journalist died (homicide, accident, crossfire, terrorist act, or not confirmed) and it assesses each death as certainly, possibly,[9] or most probably not, linked to the journalist's work.

Since the early 1990s, Russia's media monitors have recorded every violent or suspicious death that came to their attention. Determining which were linked to the journalist's work has not always been easy since law enforcement agencies in Russia were struggling to cope with a wave of murders and the number of unsolved killings of journalists steadily mounted. In the last few years,[when?] the Center for Journalism in Extreme Situations has gathered all available information about these deaths on its Memoriam site.[10] This made it possible to check how much these deaths have been investigated and how many have led to court cases. The IFJ data base summarises the information accumulated on the Memoriam site and makes it available in English for the first time. During a study of international fraud-detection homicide, which compared fraud detection homicide cases from the United States of America against fraud detection homicide cases from the former Soviet Republic, the murder of Paula Klebenikov illustrated a case of a contract killing of a journalist known to expose fraud in governments. At the time of his murder, he was thought to be investigating complex money laundering fraud scheme involving Chechen reconstruction projects. The investigation appears to reveal that Klebnikov had discovered that the fraud reached deep into the centers of power in the Kremlin, elements involving organized crime, and also the former KGB, now known as the FSB.[11]

The IFJ report Partial Justice maps the changing contours of impunity in Russia. It shows and explains the process whereby particular deaths are selected by the IFJ, CPJ, and other monitors. It stresses the need for an end to total impunity in those remaining regions (the North Caucasus, St Petersburg) where no one has ever been prosecuted for killing a journalist,[12] and for an advance beyond partial justice in those cases where it is known, or strongly suspected, that the murder of a journalist was planned and premeditated. It is not enough to put the killer on trial; they must be accompanied, or followed, by their accomplices, and the intermediaries and individuals who ordered and paid for the killing.

The IFJ report opens and closes with the Politkovskaya murder and the subsequent trial, which ran from November 2008 to February 2009. After 16 years of unsolved killings, the international outcry over her death made this a test case that might finally breach the barrier of partial justice. The evidence presented by the prosecution, unfortunately, did not convince the jury or satisfy other key participants.[13] Anatomy of Injustice, the report by the CPJ, displays the conclusions the committee has reached about certain deaths since 2000: the authorities do not acknowledge some of these deaths as homicide,[14] while several others reached the courts but have led at most to the conviction of the perpetrator, not those who ordered the killing.

Following different routes the two reports reach a similar set of recommendations. They call on Russian authorities to give investigators and courts the backing they need to identify and pursue all those responsible for the deaths of journalists and, in the meanwhile, to keep the press and the public better informed about their progress in tackling such disturbing crimes.

In the 1990s and early 2000s, the homicide rate in Russia was among the highest in the world.[15][16][17] There were over 500 contract killings in Russia in 1994.[18] The Committee to Protect Journalists lists Russia as ""the third deadliest country in the world for journalists"" since 1991, exceeded in the number of deaths only by Algeria (1993–1996) and post-invasion Iraq.[19] Setting Russia alongside its G20 partners – not just the US and France, but also Saudi Arabia and China (see Table 1, in the IFJ report).[20] Russia's problem, shared by certain other members of G20 (India, Brazil, and Mexico), is not simply one of the number of deaths but the persistence of killing with impunity continuing over many years. The varied conditions in these economically important countries highlight a further crucial dimension. The killing of journalists may be the most dramatic and frequently quoted ""barometer of press freedom""[21] but it is by no means the only measure. What it signifies for a particular country can only be properly gauged in the wider context of press freedom and other liberties, present (or absent) in that society.[22] Very few journalists have been killed in China[23] and none, it would seem, in North Korea. Other shortcomings ensure those countries occupy a lower position than Russia on any index of press freedom.

Mikhail Beketov initially survived a 2008 attack and died five years later.[24] Immediate death is the extreme end of the spectrum of threats and intimidation.

The violent deaths of journalists began in the Yeltsin era (1991–1999) and continued under Putin, president of Russia from 31 December 1999 to 7 May 2008.[25] When Medvedev became president, he spoke of the need to end ""legal nihilism"".[citation needed] From 2003 to 2008 there have been a rising number of trials[12] but by November 2009 there had yet to be a major breakthrough, under Medvedev, of either in the prosecution of pre-2008 deaths or the investigation of killings since his May 2008 inauguration. The Politkovskaya murder trial and the first arrests in the Baburova-Markelov slaying (November 2009) showed some inconclusive signs of movement.

The yearly figures in the table above are derived from the ""journalists in Russia"" database, where details can be found on each individual death. Certain important[according to whom?] categories are not included. Those who have gone ""missing"" (14 persons);[26] those who died in an incident (""not confirmed"", 28 persons), the nature of which has not been satisfactorily established; and journalists killed in work-related accidents (37 persons),[27] may be found online in the IFJ database.

The third set of figures indicates the yearly number of verdicts reached in trials for the killing of journalists. With only three exceptions these have all been for homicide. Some cases have taken six to seven years to reach court (e.g. the killings of Dmitry Kholodov and Igor Domnikov) but most deaths that have resulted in prosecution take, on average, 12–24 months between the killing and the verdict.[28][29]

Rates of conviction are a different matter. When the death was not related to the journalist's work the conviction rate exceeds 90%. When the journalist's death was certainly or seems likely to have been related to his or her work, the rate of acquittals rise sharply to around half of the total. Most trials are still held before a judge, aided by two lay assessors. Trial by judge and jury, which is still very rare in Russia, generally offers a more rigorous testing of evidence, robust defence of the suspects, and a higher chance of the defendant being found not guilty (average acquittal rate of 20%). The Politkovskaya murder trial, which was held before a jury, ended in February 2009 with the acquittal of all those accused.

If approximately three-quarters of journalists' murders over the past 16 years were not related to their investigations and publications However, the CJES considers that up to 70% of assaults, which annually run into the dozens, are work-related. Sometimes these are very serious. In November 2008, Mikhail Beketov, chief editor of the Khimkinskaya pravda, a paper in a Moscow suburb, was beaten so severely that although he survived, and his paper even resumed limited publication, by early 2010 he had still not regained the power of speech or independent movement.[30][31] He died in 2013.

Since Vladimir Putin first became prime minister in 1999 (president from 2000), the Russian authorities have been urged repeatedly by Western governments and international media bodies to do more to investigate the deaths of journalists. The Paris-based Reporters Without Borders frequently criticized Russia for what it described as a failure to investigate these murders.[32][33][34][34][35][36][37] The organization further claimed that many of the murdered journalists had been critical of Russian President Putin. Between March 2000 and July 2007, Reporters Without Borders claimed 21 journalists were murdered in Russia because of their work.[38]

Similar figures were produced by the committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ).[39] In a June 2007 statement, the CPJ said, ""A total of 47 journalists have been killed in Russia since 1992, with the vast majority of killings unsolved,"".[19] Seventeen of these journalists had been killed ""in the line of duty"" since 2000: 14 were murdered in retaliation for their journalism, ""two died in crossfire; and one was killed while covering a dangerous assignment"". The CPJ was continuing to investigate the deaths of eight other journalists to see if there was a link between their murder and their work. According to the CPJ, none of the 14 murders committed since 2000 had been solved and ""13 bear the marks of contract hits"".[19]

Pressure on the Russian authorities increased in late 2006 after the murder of Anna Politkovskaya. In June 2007, the board of the World Association of Newspapers passed a resolution, calling on the authorities in Russia to ""investigate journalist deaths more vigorously"":[40]

On 18 June 2007, the U.S. House of Representatives passed House Resolution 151, calling on Putin to ""step-up efforts to investigate"" the murders.[41] In a report published in 2007, the International News Safety Institute said more journalists had died violent deaths in Russia in the previous 10 years than anywhere in the world apart from Iraq,[42] though it offered statistics rather than details of the individual victims.[41] The British New Statesman magazine's website, which it described as ""solidarity with the dead, and in association with Amnesty International, Center for Journalism in Extreme Situations, the Committee to Protect Journalists, and Index on Censorship"" published a list of 40 Russian journalists killed since 1993, representing only some of those who died.[43]

Immediately after Politkovskaya's murder doubts were expressed about the chances of justice being done, even though the victim in this case was a journalist who had acquired a worldwide reputation (cf. Dmitry Kholodov in 1994). American commentator Anne Applebaum thought that the murderers of Politkovskaya would never be found.[44] There were also some dissenting and sceptical voices.

Recent killings, in various parts of Russia, of Ilyas Shurpayev,[45] Yury Shebalkin,[46] Konstantin Borovko[47] and Leonid Etkind[48] did indeed lead to trials and convictions. This was also true of some of the men involved in the brutal, earlier murder of 23-year-old Internet journalist Vladimir Sukhomlin.[49] Ilya Zimin's alleged killer, meanwhile, was tried in his native Moldova and acquitted.[50] Yet these examples do not disprove the charge of partial justice since only one of the deaths was related beyond doubt to the journalistic work of the victim.

Criticism from abroad was frequently perceived and rejected as selective. However, Russia's sought-for status as a member of G8 from 1997 onwards set a benchmark that showed the continuing deaths of journalists, and of other media restrictions within the country, in an unfavourable light. Also of importance was the country's admission to the Council of Europe and, as a result, the potential involvement, after 1998, of the European Court of Human Rights as an arbiter of last resort. Unsuccessful attempts were made for the 2004 acquittal of Dmitry Kholodov's alleged killers to be examined in Strasbourg. So far the Court has only once determined the failure of the Russian authorities to pursue those responsible for the violent deaths of journalists. In 2005 it ruled that the October 1999 killing in Chechnya of cameramen Ramzan Mezhidov and Shamil Gigayev and of more than thirty other civilians who died during the same incident had not been properly investigated.[51]
