      "If you thought it would cost thousands of dollars to turn your house into a smart home, think again.\n",
      "Gone are the days when an online connection was confined to just your computer – now you can have everything from your refrigerator to your record player use the internet.\n",
      "And the chances are, you already have a lot of the necessary technology in your home.\n",
      "With a few simple tweaks, it’s now possible to hook households up to get the newest tech – with the strongest WiFi signal – around the home. We investigate how…\n",
      "\n",
      "Scroll down for video\n",
      "What WiFi looks like: While we obviously can't see WiFi signals, one artist has created this amazing images of what signals would look like if we could. The WiFi pulses are shown here as spheres. Lamm used red, orange, yellow and other colors to represent these invisible channels that make up the overall WiFi signal.\n",
      "\n",
      "If things really are bad, then it might be worth considering buying a booster.\n",
      "However, before you do, it's worth doing a bit of hunting online, as in many cases its possible to use an old router as a booster, simply by ticking a couple of boxes on its settings.\n",
      "If you have a second router that's only about a year old, it can probably be set to operate in 'access point' or repeater mode. Configuring is often as simple as clicking a button\n",
      "It's also worth checking your other WiFi kit - for instance, some Sonos WiFi enabled speakers such as the Playbar, below, can also double as a signal booster.\n",
      "The Sonos Playbar. some Sonos kit can also act as a signal booster for your WiFi signal.\n",
      "If you're a T-Mobile customer, there's also another option - the Personal CellSpot.\n",
      "This piece of kit can be used to maximize your personal coverage, even beyond the reach of any cellular network, which means where you have blackspots in your home - for example in the basement - you could now enjoy great coverage.\n",
      "The Personal CellSpot can optimise WiFi calling and give you faster data, and simply plugs in.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you've got an old iPad or iPhone lying around, it's relatively simple to turn it into a security camera without having to spent hundreds of dollars on new kit.\n",
      "Free apps such asPresencecan send a live stream to you wherever you are.\n",
      "It provides a live stream from the area you want to monitor.\n",
      "You can set it up to record video clips when it detects motion, too.\n",
      "If you buy a robotic viewing stand for about $100, you can even move the camera 360 degrees rather than stick with a stationary view.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "WiFi signals use very low intensity radio waves.\n",
      "Whilst similar in wavelength to domestic microwave radiation, the intensity of WiFi radiation is 100,000 times less than that of a domestic microwave oven.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sitting in a WiFi hotspot for a year results in receiving the same dose of radio waves as making a 20 minute mobile phone call.\n",
      "\n",
      "As with everything in technology, things change quickly - and WiFi standards are no exception.\n",
      "The good news is that you may even be able to do this for free.\n",
      "Check with the firm that makes your router to see if they have a firmware update available.\n",
      "This will update your router's software, and can often have a big effect on its speed and range.\n",
      "It's also worth considering a new handset.\n",
      "For instance, the new iPhone 6 handsets offer a new standard called 802.11ac, which offers far faster connection speeds that the iPhone 5s, which only had 801.11n.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, be warned, there are a plethora of terrible acronyms to deal with when it comes to WiFi standards.\n",
      "In general, wireless A, B, and G are old and slow, and wireless n or ac will give you the fastest speeds around.\n",
      "Note that you'll need both a compatible router and card in your computer or phone if you want the full speed boost.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the best ways to improve your home WiFi is to change the channel it uses.\n",
      "WiFi uses a spectrum of frequency space, and each has different channels that can be used.\n",
      "Most routers are using the 2.4GHz band and there is a total of 14 channels for this band, though only 13 (or less) are mostly used throughout the world.\n",
      "However, the problem is that many routers are configured to use the same channel.\n",
      "In a place such as a large apartment block where there are many routers, this can cause major congestion.\n",
      "Apps such as the free WiFi Analyzer for Android can help to pick the best channel for your home WiFi\n",
      "Other WiFi networks will interfere with your WiFi signal, causing it to go slow.\n",
      "However, changing channels is relatively simple, and free apps can show you exactly which channels are in use, helping you choose the best one.\n",
      "One neat trick is to use your phone to do this - apps such asWifi Analyzeron Android will do this for free.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's the cry of IT departments everywhere - have you tried switching it off and on again?\n",
      "Yet most of the time, it works.\n",
      "With WiFi routers, resetting the device every now and again isn't a bad idea, and some experts even recommend it.\n",
      "By resetting the router, you are forcing the router to reconnect to your service provider - which can often result in a boost to speed.\n",
      "Simply switching your router off and on again can often be a sure fire way to solve basic problems.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Admittedly most routers aren't the prettiest pieces of kit - but that doesn't mean you should hide them behind the TV cabinet.\n",
      "Experts say the key if you want the best signal is to have the router out in the open, free of any walls and obstructions.\n",
      "Point the antennas vertically, and elevate the router if you can.\n",
      "Jason Cole, a PhD physics student at the John Adams Institute at Imperial College London, turned to mathematics to find out how he could improve his internet connection.\n",
      "Using something known as the Helmholtz equation, which can resolve physical problems in both space and time, Mr Cole simulated his flat in a program called Matlab.\n",
      "In the simulation he mapped out his flat and then created a virtual router and computer, shown below.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "He suggests that the only solution to ensure as few blackspots as possible is to place the router in the middle of the flat.\n",
      "'It turned out that the model I developed was very sensitive to every little detail, so it was difficult to say other than the common sense advice: direct line-of-sight to the router is best,' he explains.\n",
      "'There is also some reflection of the signal around corners, but engineers tell me reflections are bad too.\n",
      "'In my case, the best position was as central as possible, preferably near open doorways.'\n",
      "Lastly, make sure its in the center of your house, so you have the best coverage possible throughout your home\n",
      "\n",
      "Getting free WiFi wherever you are is getting easier by the day.\n",
      "Chances are, your mobile network and internet provider already have deals to give you access to other networks when you're out and about.\n",
      "Many cities, such as San Francisco and New York, are also rolling out free WiFi services in parks and shopping centres.\n",
      "For customers of T-mobile, even flying doesn't stop the free WiFi.\n",
      "The firm offers free in-flight texting, picture messaging, and access to T-Mobile Visual Voicemail on Gogo equipped US airlines.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "If you've got a relatively new TV or cable box, the chances are that, as the saying goes: there's an app for that.\n",
      "Many of these make navigating the impenetrable menus of your programme guide far easier - particularly some of the tablet versions of cable TV firm's apps.\n",
      "Chances are, if you have a recent TV or cable box, there's an app for it that could make it far easier to use\n",
      "Some will even act as a second screen, letting you watch TV in bed or even out and about.\n",
      "TV boxes such as Apple TV also have accompanying apps that make entering text and navigating easy.\n",
      "Consoles such as Microsoft's Xbox and Sony's Playstation also have great apps letting you do everything from buy games to access secret maps.\n",
      "The good news is, most of the apps are free - so it's well worth investigating if your home electronics are already WiFi enabled.\n",
