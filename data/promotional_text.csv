Even though the relatives and doctors of the late Supreme Court JusticeAntonin Scaliareportedly knew about his health conditions, the fact that the concerns were kept from the public is in keeping with the practices of the court, experts said. Unlike the White House, which regularly releases updates on the president's health, the Supreme Court does not have set guidelines regarding what they do and don't disclose publicly. When the 79-year-old justice wasfound dead on Saturdayin a hotel room at a luxury ranch in Texas, the county's presiding judge, Cinderella Guevara, was called and pronounced him dead. Guevara said she spoke to Scalia's doctor in Washington who told her that Scalia had been sick and had visited his office twice during the week leading up to the trip. The Associated Press reported that Guevara said the doctor told her that Scalia had a history of high blood pressure, heart trouble and was considered too weak to undergo shoulder surgery following a recent injury. Guevara told ABC News that the death certificate will say that he died of natural causes with myocardial infarction, better known as a heart attack, being a contributing factor. Dr. Sahil Parikh, an interventional cardiologist at University Hospitals Case Medical Center, never treated Scalia but said that even without knowing his specific family history, there are certain clear factors that may have contributed. Parikh said that two significant risk factors for heart disease are an individual’s age and gender, with men over 55 years old being the most at-risk group. “He clearly has some risk factors for heart disease and as those increase in number, so does your risk for having a coronary event,” Parikh told ABC News. Even though it appears that nothing had been released recently by the Supreme Court about Justice Scalia's health, there have been other disclosures made about different members of the bench. JusticeRuth Bader Ginsburg, who is now 82, has had cancer twice and made disclosures in both cases. Kate Shaw, an ABC News contributor and an assistant professor of law at the Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law in New York, said that Ginsburg has been ""very forthcoming"" with regards to her health. Ginsburg released a statement in November 2014 saying that she was going to have a heart stent implanted. ""The procedure went smoothly, and she did not miss a single day of oral arguments,"" Shaw said. Shaw also pointed out that the court released a statement after ChiefJustice John Robertssuffered a seizure in 2007. The disclosures, when they come, typically are made after an official prognosis by a doctor. ""When Chief Justice Rehnquist was diagnosed with thyroid cancer in October 2004, the Supreme Court's public information office announced the diagnosis, and further announced that he would be undergoing radiation and chemotherapy,"" Shaw said. ""He returned to the bench in March of 2005, and when he declined to announce his retirement at the end of that term -- Justice O’Connor instead announced her retirement -- the assumption was that Chief Justice Rehnquist was in good health and would continue serving,"" Shaw said. ""But his health rapidly declined in July and August, and he died on Sept. 3, 2005, creating a second vacancy for President Bush to fill."" According to a report compiled by the Congressional Research Service, 41% of the Supreme Court vacancies that occurred in the first half of the 20th century were a result of a justice dying while in office. Since then, however, Rehnquist's death was the only one for a sitting Justice since 1954, the report states. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

USA Today ,"“Everything that needs to be said hasalready been said, but since no one waslistening, everything must be said again.” “Everything that needs to be said has already been said, but since no one was listening, everything must be said again.” Progress is made not only by looking to the future, but by learning from the past. In a world so technologically advanced that heart rates are shared with the flick of a wristband and doctors can identify disease through a single gene, mankind is still faced with the fundamental questions of how do you end pain, postpone death and create a better life. Season two of CinemaxâsThe Knickspotlights a range of social issues that existed in America during the 1900's. These social conflicts, which were prominent in New York City at the turn of the last century, still remain an issue today. “It is not you alone, nor I alone;Not a few races, nor a few generations, nor a few centuries;It is that each came, or comes, or shall come.” “It is not you alone, nor I alone; Not a few races, nor a few generations, nor a few centuries; It is that each came, or comes, or shall come.” The turn of the 20th century saw one of the largest movements of humanity in the history of the world. In the 30 years between 1892 and 1924, 14 million people passed through New York City's Ellis Island to enter the United States. Often carrying just a single bag on their back, immigrants were absorbed into a rapidly industrializing society. In 2014, nearly 60 million people were forcibly displaced worldwide. If these refugees, internally displaced persons and asylum seekers were to make up a nation, it would be larger than South Africa and slightly smaller than Italy. One hundred years ago, immigrants crossed the Atlantic Ocean in the hopes of finding opportunity in the New World. Today, though the destinations may have changed, the search for a new beginning remains. Whether itâs the pull of progress, the promise of peace or the simple need to survive, more people are moving today than ever recorded. Every two seconds someone is forced from their home because of conflict or persecution. The largest refugee crisis since World War II is sweeping the globe as hundreds of thousands of people flee war-torn and impoverished countries searching for a better life in Western Europe. A century ago, over 70 percent of immigrants coming to America were from Eastern and Southern Europe. Once they arrived at Ellis Island they were herded into a temporary reception hall to be tested for disease. Although the organized process has changed, the stories from now look strikingly similar to the stories of then. Photojournalist Pete Kiehart has been documenting refugees as they encountered an abruptly-closed border between Serbia and Hungary, crossed through dusty fields into Croatia, and arrived in Austria where some plan to settle.

After walking from the nearby town's train station migrants waited for hours in this transit zone parking lot. There are more refugees in the world today than ever recorded and more than half of them are children. In 2014, 19.5 million people were forced to leave their homeland because of war, persecution or natural disaster. Whether it be a painting or photograph,the picture is a symbol that brings oneimmediately into close touch with reality Whether it be a painting or photograph, the picture is a symbol that brings one immediately into close touch with reality Although a century has passed since the first immigrants landed on Ellis Island, the United States remains a destination for over 121,000 people who applied for asylum or refugee status in 2014. Capturing the faces of Ellis Island in the early 1900âs, photographer and sociologist Lewis Hine pushed for social reform through his images of newly arrived immigrants into New York. Today, photojournalist Danny Ghitis captures the stories of those who have left their homelands, and now call New York home.

Deaths in one day are numberless, The hazy sun is covered by sombre clouds. The largest outbreak of the Ebola virus began in West Africa in 2014, unleashing a wave of fear across the globe. The outbreak lead to a worldwide mobilization to stop the spread of the disease. The death toll from Ebola as of September 22, 2015 stands at 11,311 with 28,355 reported cases. More than a century earlier, a similar global effort brought an end to the largest outbreak of the Bubonic Plague, which began in China and spread to nearly every continent. The Bubonic plague ultimately claimed the lives of 13 million people. Paralleled alongside never before published photos of the Bubonic Plague from the Burns Archive are Getty Images Reportage photographer Daniel Berehulak's photos from his coverage of Ebola in Liberia. Marie Raedd is carried by health workers wearing protective clothing, into an ambulance to be taken with her mother to an Ebola treatment center in Monrovia on October 01, 2014. A Liberian Red Cross burial team wearing protective clothing are disinfected on August 28, 2014 in Monrovia, Liberia. The center, a closed primary school originally built by USAID, was being used to temporarily isolate people suspected of carrying the virus. Doctor Steven Hatch, 45, dressed in protective clothing, draws blood from a patient suspected of having Ebola, to be sent to a mobile testing laboratory for an Ebola test, as he works in the high-risk suspected ward at the Bong County Ebola Treatment Unit, on October 6, 2014 in Suakoku near Gbarnga in Bong County, Liberia. The blood samples are collected from patients and sent to a US navy mobile testing laboratory based at Cuttington University, being used for Ebola testing. The Bubonic Plague slowly traveled for over 100 years spreading panic from British India, where quarantine measures provoked uprisings against colonial rule, to Hawaii where troops enforced a quarantine and torched infected buildings, all the way to San Francisco's Chinatown. The explosive outbreak of Ebola in 2014 generated a similar fear on a much shorter timeframe. Starting in Guinea, the virus quickly spread to surrounding countries, and within six months had reached the U.S. and Europe. Starting in south central China in the 1850's, it reached the international hub of Hong Kong by 1894. Commercial ships carrying rats harboring infected fleas spread the plague until it reached San Franciscoâs Chinatown in 1900. This marked the first ever plague epidemic in the United States. The most common form of plague in humans, characterized by fever, delirium, and the formation of buboes. The outbreak of Ebola in 2014 began in West Africa, before being carried to Europe and the United States by returning aid workers. The U.S. saw four confirmed cases; one led to death. Today, Ebola remains a localized issue with the disease still present in Guinea and Sierra Leone. An infectious and generally fatal disease marked by fever and severe internal bleeding, spread through contact with infected body. “Doctors 100 years ago, 200 years ago, 300 and in the past, were just as smart, just as brilliant, just as innovative as doctors are today. They worked to help and heal their patients. However, they labored under inferior knowledge and technology, and I guarantee you that 100 years from now people will look at what we're doing with the same scant eye.”— Stanley Burns, MD, FACS The Plague - With Historian Dr. Stanley B. BurnsfromCourageous StudioonVimeo. Plague is carried by rats and fleas, you think your wooden barriers arekeeping them inside? Dr.Feng just said there are no new cases.There's no need for quarantine. Plague is carried by rats and fleas, you think your wooden barriers are keeping them inside? Dr.Feng just said there are no new cases. There's no need for quarantine. “What a fearful thing is ignorance.” “What a fearful thing is ignorance.” Throughout history, the medical world has constantly searched for new ways to numb pain. In the late 19th century, cocaine was discovered in medicine and first used as a form of local anesthetic.This new drug allowed doctors to perform surgeries that had never been tried before. Physicians soon saw that with the benefits came a long list of side effects including addiction. What was once an open market for cocaine and cocaine-infused products came to an end in 1914 as the federal government stopped the unregulated sale of the drug. The need to find innovative ways to dull pain continues today. In 1996, California allowed medical marijuana to be prescribed by doctors, opening up the opportunity for this controlled substance to bring relief to patients. Since then, 22 states have followed. On January 1, 2016, New York will become the next state to allow the sale of medical marijuana. In the early 1900âs the U.S. imported between 600 and 1000 metric tons a year of raw cocaine in the form of coca. It was sold in a variety of tonics, elixirs and over-the-counter products. It was used to treat ailments ranging from toothaches and chronic pain to shyness, and to break morphine addicts of their habit. Today, medical marijuana has been used to treat everything from multiple sclerosis and epilepsy, to chronic pain and the nausea that follows chemotherapy. Despite relaxed state laws, the federal government continues to regulate marijuana as a schedule-1 drug, making it illegal to grow, possess and use anywhere in the United States. A gram of cocaine could be bought for as little as in1904, which is the equivalent of roughly$6today. A gram of medical marijuana can be bought for about today. The U.S. legal cannibus market hit$2.7 billionin2014. At the turn of the 20th century cocaine was readily available for sale in pharmacies and was used in popular products such as soft drinks. With the use of medical marijuana becoming increasingly normalized across the United States, growers are seeing a rise in demand across the country. By the late 1880's cocaine use was widespread in the U.S. The eminent neurologist William Hammond was touting it in print and lectures, assuring audiences of its benefits as a surgical painkiller and a low-dosage pick-me-up that was no more addictive than coffee or tea. Druggist sold cocaine in cigarettes, cordials and soft drinks until 1900. By 1907, New York State had regulated cocaine, requiring a doctor's prescription. Dr. William Halstead was an early champion of the drug and its use in medicine. After many experiments both on patients and himself, he soon saw the side effects first hand as he suffered from addiction. Sweeping violence and addiction led to the federal Harrison Act regulating government cocaine in 1914, and by the late 1920's cocaine had fallen out of favor except among the wealthy, Bohemian crowd. Amphetamines and heroin became the drugs of choice as prohibition swept America in the 1920's, and cocaine disappeared until it surfaced again in the 1970's disco era. By the end of 2014, an estimated 2.4 million Americans were using marijuana for medical purposes. While New York City waits for its first medical marijuana dispensaries to open, just across the river in New Jersey patients are benefiting from its medical use. Marta Portuguez who suffers from gastroparesis, fibromyalgia and intractable spasticity, says she's constantly in severe pain. She's tried many different pharmaceutical solutions from narcotic painkillers to newer synthetic drugs. For Marta, those other drugs have not worked. Every few weeks Marta, with the help of one of her family members, leaves her home and purchases medical marijuana from a dispensary in New Jersey. Her husband Rafael said she will need to stay in bed for upwards of a week to recover from a day of activity. Do No Harm - A Story About Medical MarijuanafromCourageous StudioonVimeo.

The outbreak lead to a worldwide mobilization to stop the spread of the disease. The death toll from Ebola as of September 22, 2015 stands at 11,311 with 28,355 reported cases. More than a century earlier, a similar global effort brought an end to the largest outbreak of the Bubonic Plague, which began in China and spread to nearly every continent. The Bubonic plague ultimately claimed the lives of 13 million people. Paralleled alongside never before published photos of the Bubonic Plague from the Burns Archive are Getty Images Reportage photographer Daniel Berehulak's photos from his coverage of Ebola in Liberia.

The blood samples are collected from patients and sent to a US navy mobile testing laboratory based at Cuttington University, being used for Ebola testing. The Bubonic Plague slowly traveled for over 100 years spreading panic from British India, where quarantine measures provoked uprisings against colonial rule, to Hawaii where troops enforced a quarantine and torched infected buildings, all the way to San Francisco's Chinatown. The explosive outbreak of Ebola in 2014 generated a similar fear on a much shorter timeframe. Starting in Guinea, the virus quickly spread to surrounding countries, and within six months had reached the U.S. and Europe. Starting in south central China in the 1850's, it reached the international hub of Hong Kong by 1894. Commercial ships carrying rats harboring infected fleas spread the plague until it reached San Franciscoâs Chinatown in 1900. This marked the first ever plague epidemic in the United States. The most common form of plague in humans, characterized by fever, delirium, and the formation of buboes. The outbreak of Ebola in 2014 began in West Africa, before being carried to Europe and the United States by returning aid workers. The U.S. saw four confirmed cases; one led to death. Today, Ebola remains a localized issue with the disease still present in Guinea and Sierra Leone. An infectious and generally fatal disease marked by fever and severe internal bleeding, spread through contact with infected body. “Doctors 100 years ago, 200 years ago, 300 and in the past, were just as smart, just as brilliant, just as innovative as doctors are today. They worked to help and heal their patients. However, they labored under inferior knowledge and technology, and I guarantee you that 100 years from now people will look at what we're doing with the same scant eye.”— Stanley Burns, MD, FACS The Plague - With Historian Dr. Stanley B. BurnsfromCourageous StudioonVimeo. Plague is carried by rats and fleas, you think your wooden barriers arekeeping them inside? Dr.Feng just said there are no new cases.There's no need for quarantine. Plague is carried by rats and fleas, you think your wooden barriers are keeping them inside? Dr.Feng just said there are no new cases. There's no need for quarantine. “What a fearful thing is ignorance.” “What a fearful thing is ignorance.” Throughout history, the medical world has constantly searched for new ways to numb pain. In the late 19th century, cocaine was discovered in medicine and first used as a form of local anesthetic.This new drug allowed doctors to perform surgeries that had never been tried before. Physicians soon saw that with the benefits came a long list of side effects including addiction. What was once an open market for cocaine and cocaine-infused products came to an end in 1914 as the federal government stopped the unregulated sale of the drug. The need to find innovative ways to dull pain continues today. In 1996, California allowed medical marijuana to be prescribed by doctors, opening up the opportunity for this controlled substance to bring relief to patients. Since then, 22 states have followed. On January 1, 2016, New York will become the next state to allow the sale of medical marijuana. In the early 1900âs the U.S. imported between 600 and 1000 metric tons a year of raw cocaine in the form of coca. It was sold in a variety of tonics, elixirs and over-the-counter products. It was used to treat ailments ranging from toothaches and chronic pain to shyness, and to break morphine addicts of their habit. Today, medical marijuana has been used to treat everything from multiple sclerosis and epilepsy, to chronic pain and the nausea that follows chemotherapy. Despite relaxed state laws, the federal government continues to regulate marijuana as a schedule-1 drug, making it illegal to grow, possess and use anywhere in the United States. A gram of cocaine could be bought for as little as in1904, which is the equivalent of roughly$6today. A gram of medical marijuana can be bought for about today. The U.S. legal cannibus market hit$2.7 billionin2014. At the turn of the 20th century cocaine was readily available for sale in pharmacies and was used in popular products such as soft drinks. With the use of medical marijuana becoming increasingly normalized across the United States, growers are seeing a rise in demand across the country. By the late 1880's cocaine use was widespread in the U.S. The eminent neurologist William Hammond was touting it in print and lectures, assuring audiences of its benefits as a surgical painkiller and a low-dosage pick-me-up that was no more addictive than coffee or tea. Druggist sold cocaine in cigarettes, cordials and soft drinks until 1900. By 1907, New York State had regulated cocaine, requiring a doctor's prescription. Dr. William Halstead was an early champion of the drug and its use in medicine. After many experiments both on patients and himself, he soon saw the side effects first hand as he suffered from addiction. Sweeping violence and addiction led to the federal Harrison Act regulating government cocaine in 1914, and by the late 1920's cocaine had fallen out of favor except among the wealthy, Bohemian crowd. Amphetamines and heroin became the drugs of choice as prohibition swept America in the 1920's, and cocaine disappeared until it surfaced again in the 1970's disco era. By the end of 2014, an estimated 2.4 million Americans were using marijuana for medical purposes. While New York City waits for its first medical marijuana dispensaries to open, just across the river in New Jersey patients are benefiting from its medical use. Marta Portuguez who suffers from gastroparesis, fibromyalgia and intractable spasticity, says she's constantly in severe pain. She's tried many different pharmaceutical solutions from narcotic painkillers to newer synthetic drugs. For Marta, those other drugs have not worked. Every few weeks Marta, with the help of one of her family members, leaves her home and purchases medical marijuana from a dispensary in New Jersey. Her husband Rafael said she will need to stay in bed for upwards of a week to recover from a day of activity. Do No Harm - A Story About Medical MarijuanafromCourageous StudioonVimeo.

USA Today ,"“Everything that needs to be said hasalready been said, but since no one waslistening, everything must be said again.” “Everything that needs to be said has already been said, but since no one was listening, everything must be said again.” Progress is made not only by looking to the future, but by learning from the past. In a world so technologically advanced that heart rates are shared with the flick of a wristband and doctors can identify disease through a single gene, mankind is still faced with the fundamental questions of how do you end pain, postpone death and create a better life. Season two of CinemaxâsThe Knickspotlights a range of social issues that existed in America during the 1900's. These social conflicts, which were prominent in New York City at the turn of the last century, still remain an issue today. “It is not you alone, nor I alone;Not a few races, nor a few generations, nor a few centuries;It is that each came, or comes, or shall come.” “It is not you alone, nor I alone; Not a few races, nor a few generations, nor a few centuries; It is that each came, or comes, or shall come.” The turn of the 20th century saw one of the largest movements of humanity in the history of the world. In the 30 years between 1892 and 1924, 14 million people passed through New York City's Ellis Island to enter the United States. Often carrying just a single bag on their back, immigrants were absorbed into a rapidly industrializing society. In 2014, nearly 60 million people were forcibly displaced worldwide. If these refugees, internally displaced persons and asylum seekers were to make up a nation, it would be larger than South Africa and slightly smaller than Italy. One hundred years ago, immigrants crossed the Atlantic Ocean in the hopes of finding opportunity in the New World. Today, though the destinations may have changed, the search for a new beginning remains. Whether itâs the pull of progress, the promise of peace or the simple need to survive, more people are moving today than ever recorded. Every two seconds someone is forced from their home because of conflict or persecution. The largest refugee crisis since World War II is sweeping the globe as hundreds of thousands of people flee war-torn and impoverished countries searching for a better life in Western Europe. A century ago, over 70 percent of immigrants coming to America were from Eastern and Southern Europe. Once they arrived at Ellis Island they were herded into a temporary reception hall to be tested for disease. Although the organized process has changed, the stories from now look strikingly similar to the stories of then. Photojournalist Pete Kiehart has been documenting refugees as they encountered an abruptly-closed border between Serbia and Hungary, crossed through dusty fields into Croatia, and arrived in Austria where some plan to settle.

MSN News,"For the vast majority of Americans, the career ""finish line"" is hitting a retirement number and being able to retire on their own terms. In reality, though, hitting the finish line is getting increasingly tough. Instead of the road to retirement being a straight line from Point A to B, it's often filled with twists and turns. Unexpected expenses and other rising costs are making the trek to retirement quite the challenge, according to NerdWallet's2015 New Grad Retirement Report. Based on three key findings, the graduating class of 2015 faces the very real possibility that they may not retire until the age of 75. By comparison, the average retirement age today is 62. How retiring at 75 could become a realityWhat's pushing Millenials to work until the ripe age of 75? The first big issue is the growing amount of student debt today's graduates are dealing with. Average student debt these days is $35,051, up from $29,400 just three years prior, while starting wages are up only around $1,200 since 2012. With college becoming more of a requirement than an exception to land a job where economic advancement is possible, college tuitions have been rising at a pace that's vastly outpacing wage growth and inflation. The result is more than $1.2 trillion in cumulative student loan debt. According to NerdWallet, the average student loan repayment plan was 10 years, amounting to $4,239 being repaid annually (including interest payments). All told, NerdWallet suggests that repaying student loans could reduce 2015 grads' nest eggs by nearly a third, reducing their lifetime investment-earning potential by more than $684,000 over a 50-year period. Since 2012 the amount in lost retirement savings has jumped by almost $124,000. In other words, instead of investing their savings and compounding their gains over time, grads will instead be diverting their money early in their working years (where it can be of the biggest benefit over the long run) to paying back student debt. The second big issue is that rents are rising across the nation at a much quicker pace than wages. NerdWallet notes that rent prices across the U.S. are up 11% since 2012. Rising rent prices mean recent grads need to apportion an ever-greater amount of their salaries to covering basic expenses. This leaves less money for investing, and it means a potentially longer wait to retire. Lastly, NerdWallet pinpoints a lack of trust in Wall Street and skittishness toward investing as a reason why this year's grads may have to wait until age 75 to retire. The effects of the Great Recession still ring true with today's Millennials, meaning many are holding far more in cash than they should be. The result is that average annual investment returns are expected to be down, and it could take extra years for investors with a more conservative approach to reach their retirement number. NerdWallet estimates suggest that today's grads may still be able to retire at 62, but they'd need to save 20% of their income annually and invest it as opposed to the roughly 6% that they're saving and investing today. Change what we can controlLet's face it, we can't change what we can't control. College costs aren't likely to drop anytime soon with the importance of a college education growing, and rent prices may strengthen further as interest rates rise and potential homebuyers back away from paying higher mortgage rates. Some costs are simply beyond the control of today's grads. However, there are steps to be taken that could save grads money and help them do more with what they save. NerdWallet has a couple of great suggestions, including living at home for as long as is reasonable in order to save on rent costs, as well as maximizing a 401(k) match through your employer. You certainly don't want to leave free money on the table, and should almost always consider contributing at least up to the donation match in your employer-sponsored retirement plan. But there are plenty of other suggestions that could prove valuable. For instance, how you save can make a big difference come retirement. Investing in a traditional brokerage account can expose you to taxes each and every time you sell a stock, option, or mutual fund. Although long-term capital gains taxes can be 0% for low-income individuals, you're more likely to wind up paying 15% or 20% in long-term capital gains taxes when selling long-term assets in your brokerage account. You can completely eliminate taxes by opening up and contributing to a Roth IRA. A Roth IRA allows your money to grow tax-free over your lifetime, there are no required minimum distributions beginning in the year you turn 70 1/2 like its counterpart the Traditional IRA, and there's no point at which you are no longer allowed to contribute to a Roth IRA -- unlike a Traditional IRA, where you're no longer allowed to contribute past age 70. Not having to pay any taxes could save the theoretical investors in NerdWallet's report between $200,000 and $400,000 over a lifetime. Another important question iswhatto invest in. On top of keeping your money from winding up in the government's hands, new investors have to be able to trust the stock market once more. Stocks have returned an average of 8% historically, and there will certainly be periods, such as the Great Recession, where things get a bit bumpy and uncomfortable. However, the data doesn't lie. While past performance is no guarantee of future results, all 33 stock market corrections of 10% or more in theS&P 500between 1950 and 2014 were eventually erased by bull markets. Patience has historically paid off for long-term investors who pick out high-quality companies and hold them over the long run. It's also not a bad idea for younger investors to consider a more aggressive investment approach that focuses on growth stocks because they have such a long period of time to correct any investment mistakes. Allowing winners to run for decades at a time is a powerful tool that can eliminate quite a few bad stock selections. Budgeting is another important tool that today's grads are going to want to get themselves accustomed to. Far too few people have a good grasp on their cash flow, and if you don't understand how your expenses weigh on your income, then you'll have a very difficult time saving for your future. Developing a monthly budget should help boost your saving efficiency, and it'll still give you the ability to play around with the numbers to ensure you continue to live a fun life, even while budgeting for your future. Lastly, considermonetizing your hobbies. Today's Millennials really value their free time -- and their free time could actually be worth a boatload of money. Teaching guitar lessons, couponing to save at the grocery store, buying items at a garage sale then reselling them online, and pet sitting are all examples of personal hobbies that could turn into lucrative side businesses for today's grads. Plus, doing what you love certainly doesn't seem like work! Adding this extra cash to your monthly income stream could be the boost you need to move your retirement date forward. I believe there are a lot of variables left to play out between now and when today's grads hit 75. Following these suggestions could help get today's grads back on track to retiring on their own terms. The $15,978 Social Security bonus most retirees completely overlookIf you're like most Americans, you're a few years (or more) behind on your retirement savings.

Mashable.com,"cole-haan Paid Post Share By T Brand Studio Photography by Peter Ross POINTE SHOES LOOK DECEPTIVELY SIMPLE.Covered in satin, their appearance embodies the ethereal aesthetic of the dancers and the ballets they perform. But the shoes’ sleek exterior belies both their complex construction and the meticulous preparatory ritual that are integral to their function. The box — the hardened, flat front of the shoe that allows a ballerina to rise up onto her toes, to dance en pointe — comes in varying sizes and angles. Likewise, the shank — the inner sole that provides support for the arch — can be customized for thickness, flexibility and length. Countless other elements can be fine-tuned, too, from the amount of glue used to bond the components to the material for the drawstring. Young dancers typically buy standardized pointe shoes from a store, but experienced ballerinas, like those at New York City Ballet, have theirs custom-made to accommodate every imaginable variable. “Makers” craft the shoes, which can cost upwards of $80 per pair, to the ballerinas’ specifications. Getting the fit right is vital, given the 40 or so hours a week the dancer will spend in pointe shoes. But even custom-made shoes aren’t quite perfect. Dancers scratch the soles for better traction, crush the box to soften it, and attach their own ribbons at just the right spots before beginning their own unique rituals — filled with creative MacGyvering and artistic repurposing — for putting the shoes on. Megan Fairchild, a principal dancer at New York City Ballet since 2005, starts with clear medical tape, wrapping certain toes to prevent blisters. She places a wedge-shaped make-up sponge between her first and second toes for cushioning, then a paper towel partially under the ball of her left foot. She folds the left edge over to the center, then the right edge over to meet it before pulling the excess at the tip down. All of this happens before she puts her foot into the shoe and secures it with ribbons. Then she repeats an altered version of the routine on her other foot. Preparing a pointe shoe is a remarkably manual process, made all the more remarkable when you consider that the shoes are built for only a few hours of use. Expose the shoes to a bit of sweat or a particularly pointe-heavy ballet — both of which soften the supportive materials — and they might not make it to their second hour before they are deemed “dead” and have to be repaired or retired. But the time and effort ballerinas spend preparing their shoes barely holds a candle to the time and effort they put into preparing their other primary tool: their bodies. Indeed, many dancers describe these two instruments as a single tool, with the pointe shoes functioning as an extension of their legs and feet. The rigorous training schedule followed by the 91 male and female dancers at New York City Ballet can include up to five hours a day of class — a dancer’s preparation for their day of dancing — plus rehearsal. On performance days, dancers warm up for two to three hours before going on stage. It’s a routine they repeat six days a week, with only Mondays off. Though schedules vary, they can include as much as 40 hours a week of dancing. Even on the rare occasion that the dancers’ bodies are at rest, their minds are not. A 2004 study by the University College of London showed that dancers’ mirror neurons fire while watching dance, not just while dancing. This means that as they sit along the edge of the rehearsal studio — changing their shoes or taking a break to hydrate — dancers are still actively learning, absorbing and rehearsing. A ballet life is undoubtedly demanding, but many dancers don’t see it as a sacrifice. Because daily dance has been a part of their routine since childhood, there’s rarely a sense of lost normalcy. This is their normal. Sara Mearns, a dancer with NYCB since 2004 and a principal dancer since 2008, compares morning class to brushing her teeth: “You have to do it every day, for your body.” Indeed, dancing requires — and often exceeds — the physical demands of a many professional sports. “They’re running, jumping, turning, stretching, lifting, lowering, rolling,” says Marika Molnar, director of physical therapy for New York City Ballet, who has been with the company for more than 30 years. “They are in amazing shape.” “It’s a really crazy balance between artistry and athleticism,” says Gretchen Smith, 26, who joined NYCB as member of the corps de ballet in 2006. “People are slowly recognizing it, but we really do want to be acknowledged as athletes.” After watching these athletes move and learning how they prepare, it’s easy to believe that the human body is limitless. But its limits are real, and pushing any body to those limits will inevitably result in pain. “I don’t remember the last time I woke up and felt fantastic,” Megan says. “There’s pain every day.” YOU CANNOT DO THIS WITHOUT PAIN. I THINK YOU SICKLY GET USED TO IT. Differentiating pain that is part of the process from pain that constitutes an injury in need of rest or treatment can, at times, be difficult. “Pain typically starts from the moment I get out of bed,” Gretchen says. “You cannot do this without pain. I think you sickly get used to it.” Marika says that education is key to helping dancers understand their bodies enough to properly interpret and address pain. Through meetings with specialized staff, a series of lectures by a health team, and one-on-one attention during daily physical therapy sessions, the dancers learn the language of anatomy. This not only helps them speak effectively with doctors and therapists, but also helps them understand how certain muscles, ligaments and joints work — or, on bad days, don’t work — so they can perform through pain in a healthy way and prevent injury. That anatomical knowledge is vital. For ballerinas, the tiniest shift in balance on a landing can divert the pressure of impact from the toes — encased in the protective box of the pointe shoe — up through the ankle, knee, hip and back, increasing the risk of more serious injuries. As a result, ankle injuries are among the most common for ballet dancers, Marika says, followed by back and hip injuries. Luckily, most are not career-ending. Due in large part to ongoing education efforts, improvements in treatment, and a relaxation of the taboo against admitting to pain, Marika says, she sees fewer major injuries than she used to. In fact, she adds, some dancers find that their dancing benefits from their time off for recuperation. “I think they would all agree that they actually learn a lot when they have an injury,” Marika says. They learn about their bodies and their limits through physical therapy and other care, and they re-enter the studio with a heightened sense of how far they can realistically push themselves. “They’re better when they get back,” she says. Click to expand Sara found this to be true when she returned after eight months off to recover from a back injury. “Your body changes after an injury,” she says. “You find new weaknesses and new strengths.” Whether a dancer ever suffers a major injury or not, the years of rigorous rehearsal and the accumulation of smaller strains can wear the body down. “Between 18 and 40 is career time,” Marika says. As dancers age, they develop a maturity in their art that makes them even more expressive, but age undoubtedly makes it harder to keep up with younger dancers who may be able to turn faster and jump higher. While 28 isn’t “old,” Sara says, you can’t deny that your body starts to react differently as you age, triggering thoughts of what the next chapter might be. “We live our lives in seasons now,” Gretchen says, “but at some point, you realize that this isn’t going to last forever.” While the toll of relentless rehearsal and performance may ultimately contribute to a decision to end a dancing career, that same training also ingrains in dancers the skills needed to not only survive, but thrive, in whatever chapter comes next. Constant self-assessment and rigorous rehearsals teaches them discipline. Recovering from injuries strengthens their resilience and reinforces the importance of recognizing limits. With those traits and knowledge, Marika says, “they can do pretty much anything after they dance.” For many, she says, the hardest part is transitioning to a life without dance when it has consumed so much of their life and represented so much of their identity for so long. That’s why many dancers are encouraged to explore passions and connections outside of the ballet world. “It’s really sacred for me. I feel like when I’m here, I’m fully here,” Gretchen says of the rehearsal studio. “But it’s so important to me to make sure that I have some nutrients outside of work, too.” During whatever downtime can be found between rehearsals and New York City Ballet’s 160 public performances at the David H. Koch Theater Lincoln Center this year, many dancers take college courses, visit family, spend time with friends and pursue hobbies. Some of their outside activity is dance-related or a result of their work with the company, such as promotional photo shoots. A few also model clothing and shoes for retailers, or help with motion tracking for dance-related films. Megan will make her Broadway debut in the revival of On The Town, which entered previews on September 20 at the Lyric Theatre. She is also a teaching fellow at the School of American Ballet, the official school of NYCB. She hopes to be able to help prepare the next generation of NYCB dancers when her own teachers have moved on. She’s also pursuing a degree in math and economics at Fordham University, preparing for what she calls her “back-up, back-up plan” to become an actuary. Like many dancers, Megan, 30, is also trying to balance dance with the pressing realities of a relationship and a family. She and her husband, Andrew Veyette — also a principal dancer in the company — want to have kids, but that’s something that will have to be planned for and discussed. “You don’t know if you’re allowed to have a normal life, but you have to give yourself permission,” she says. “Because if you don’t have a life outside of ballet, you really have nothing to dance about.” Director - Alec Helm Executive Producer - Kaylee King-Balentine Writer - Melanie Deziel Creative Director - Rachel Gogel Art Director - Michael Ryterband Photographer - Peter Ross Producer - Alex Casner  The news and editorial staffs of The New York Times had no role in this post’s creation."

But the shoes’ sleek exterior belies both their complex construction and the meticulous preparatory ritual that are integral to their function. The box — the hardened, flat front of the shoe that allows a ballerina to rise up onto her toes, to dance en pointe — comes in varying sizes and angles. Likewise, the shank — the inner sole that provides support for the arch — can be customized for thickness, flexibility and length. Countless other elements can be fine-tuned, too, from the amount of glue used to bond the components to the material for the drawstring. Young dancers typically buy standardized pointe shoes from a store, but experienced ballerinas, like those at New York City Ballet, have theirs custom-made to accommodate every imaginable variable. “Makers” craft the shoes, which can cost upwards of $80 per pair, to the ballerinas’ specifications. Getting the fit right is vital, given the 40 or so hours a week the dancer will spend in pointe shoes. But even custom-made shoes aren’t quite perfect. Dancers scratch the soles for better traction, crush the box to soften it, and attach their own ribbons at just the right spots before beginning their own unique rituals — filled with creative MacGyvering and artistic repurposing — for putting the shoes on. Megan Fairchild, a principal dancer at New York City Ballet since 2005, starts with clear medical tape, wrapping certain toes to prevent blisters. She places a wedge-shaped make-up sponge between her first and second toes for cushioning, then a paper towel partially under the ball of her left foot. She folds the left edge over to the center, then the right edge over to meet it before pulling the excess at the tip down. All of this happens before she puts her foot into the shoe and secures it with ribbons. Then she repeats an altered version of the routine on her other foot. Preparing a pointe shoe is a remarkably manual process, made all the more remarkable when you consider that the shoes are built for only a few hours of use. Expose the shoes to a bit of sweat or a particularly pointe-heavy ballet — both of which soften the supportive materials — and they might not make it to their second hour before they are deemed “dead” and have to be repaired or retired. But the time and effort ballerinas spend preparing their shoes barely holds a candle to the time and effort they put into preparing their other primary tool: their bodies. Indeed, many dancers describe these two instruments as a single tool, with the pointe shoes functioning as an extension of their legs and feet. The rigorous training schedule followed by the 91 male and female dancers at New York City Ballet can include up to five hours a day of class — a dancer’s preparation for their day of dancing — plus rehearsal. On performance days, dancers warm up for two to three hours before going on stage. It’s a routine they repeat six days a week, with only Mondays off. Though schedules vary, they can include as much as 40 hours a week of dancing. Even on the rare occasion that the dancers’ bodies are at rest, their minds are not.

SFGate.com,"Nest Paid Post Share Tina Ware woke up early that morning to the sound of her smoke alarm. She had no idea how fast the fire would grow. Sparked by a faulty plug in another room, flames spread quickly, filling the house with smoke. “It was so thick,” she says. “We were coughing — you couldn’t breathe.” It was clear she had to get the kids to safety. “It was panic. We didn’t know what to do,” she says. “We had to get out of there.” She and her family escaped into the chilly February air, only to watch their 15-year-old home in Church Hill, Tenn., go up in flames. The speed of theWare’s fire was no exception. Homes built in recent decades burn up to eight times faster than comparable homes built between 1950 and 1970,according to a s​tudyby Underwriters Laboratories, a not-for-profit provider of product safety and certification testing services. “Thirty years ago, you had roughly 17 minutes to get out before your life was in complete danger. Today that 17 minutes is down to three or four,” says John Drengenberg, UL engineer and consumer safety director. Many factors are causing fires to burn faster and fiercer. For one,homes are biggerand often have open floorplans. As a result, fire spreads with fewer barriers. The open space accelerates fires by allowing for faster airflow and more oxygen. Most problematic are the materials used to decorate homes. “There’s no getting away from it,” says Drengenberg. “Homes have more synthetic materials than they did 30 years ago.” Our houses are literally filled with them: Everything from furniture and clothing to carpeting contain these fast-­burning substances. Given that our homes are literally flammable, fire prevention and awareness have never been more important. Part of that is recognizing problem areas in a household. “Cooking is the leading cause of home fires,” says Lorraine Carli, vice president of outreach and advocacy at the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA). “Frying on the stovetop and leaving that unattended is the combination that leads to the majority of home fires and [related] injuries.” Modern homes are filled with synthetic materials, such as foam and plastics, that burn faster and hotter than their organic counterparts three decades ago. Double pane windows, made by creating a vacuum between two panes of glass, are more energy-efficient but tend to fail faster when exposed to high temperatures. Open floorplans and higher ceilings provide fires with access to more oxygen and less containment, allowing them to spread quickly through a home.

For the Ware family,the fire started in a wall outlet of their sunroom. “We've lived in this house for 10 years. Never had a problem with it, nothing,” says Ware. By the time she arrived with a fire extinguisher, the fire had already gotten out of control. “The extinguisher was nowhere near enough. [The fire] had spread and was going through both walls.” Luke Wood, one of the firefighters who helped battle the Ware’s fire, says that having a plan of action is critical to a family's safety. “If you discover a fire in your home, try to isolate that fire,” he says. “If you find a fire in your bedroom, close the door and get everybody out the house. It only takes a few minutes for that fire to really develop and become a fully involved fire.” Sources: National Fire Protection Agency,All About Fire. Keith Bryant, president of the International Association of Fire Chiefs and himself the fire chief of Oklahoma City, says that fire safety also starts with a smoke alarm. “There’s really nothing else that people can do that protects themselves and their families more than a working smoke alarm,” he says. NFPA’s Carli also recommends that smoke alarms be interconnected, so that when one sounds, they all sound. The devices should also be able to detect multiple indicators of a fire, not just smoke, but also heat and carbon monoxide. Because the Ware family had a network of alarms, the fire was easy to locate. “It was a lady's voice saying that there was smoke in the [sunroom],” says Ware, who quickly realized smoke had spread throughout the house. Detection of smokeand carbon monoxide is particularly vital because smoke is more dangerous than ever. Modern households are filled with more synthetic materials made from oil and its derivatives — such as polyurethane and reconstituted soda bottles — so smoke is often tainted with toxins such as hydrogen cyanide, phosgene and carbon monoxide. In fact, according to the NFPA, most fatalities from fires are caused by smoke inhalation, not by burns. Ware’s experience was typical of a modern residential fire: “[The sunroom] was full of smoke from the ceiling to the bottom of the floor,” she says. Because of the changes to residential fires in recent years, firefighters have had to adapt their tactics. This has meant wearing advanced protective gear and getting to fires faster. “It used to be that the rule was a fire in a home would double its size every two minutes,” says Bryant. “Because of the new materials, that’s a lot quicker now. That’s why those response times are so critical.” Once firefighters arrive, they must attack the fires more efficiently than they have in the past. “The normal procedure, ever since Ben Franklin started fire departments,” says Drengenberg, “was to get up on a roof and chop a hole in it.” Cutting a hole in the roof allows firefighters to vent hazardous chemicals and smoke, as well as see how far a fire has progressed. Today, firefighters are doing things differently. “They’re seeing maybe that isn’t the best way — that it may introduce more oxygen and help it spread quicker,” says Drengenberg, who points out that masks and air packs allow firefighters more versatility than ever before. Smoke alarms, too, are changing. “As house fires have become more dangerous, firefighters have evolved — but residential fire safety equipment hadn't, and we wanted to change that with Nest Protect,” says Maxime Veron, Nest’s head of hardware product marketing. Because the Ware family had smart alarms, Tina’s husband Doug — who had already left for work — knew about the fire almost instantaneously via his smartphone: “He was already aware of [the fire] before I had even called him,” says Mrs. Ware. Tap icons for more. Benjamin Franklin envisioned the first fire department. Seeing that volunteers weren’t enough, Franklin suggested a “club or society of active men belonging to each fire engine; whose business is to attend all fires with it whenever they happen.""

Post-­style fire hydrants, however, appeared in 1801, when the chief engineer of the Philadelphia Water Works added a hose outlet to his design.

SFGate.com,"Nest Paid Post Share Tina Ware woke up early that morning to the sound of her smoke alarm. She had no idea how fast the fire would grow. Sparked by a faulty plug in another room, flames spread quickly, filling the house with smoke. “It was so thick,” she says. “We were coughing — you couldn’t breathe.” It was clear she had to get the kids to safety. “It was panic. We didn’t know what to do,” she says. “We had to get out of there.” She and her family escaped into the chilly February air, only to watch their 15-year-old home in Church Hill, Tenn., go up in flames. The speed of theWare’s fire was no exception. Homes built in recent decades burn up to eight times faster than comparable homes built between 1950 and 1970,according to a s​tudyby Underwriters Laboratories, a not-for-profit provider of product safety and certification testing services. “Thirty years ago, you had roughly 17 minutes to get out before your life was in complete danger. Today that 17 minutes is down to three or four,” says John Drengenberg, UL engineer and consumer safety director. Many factors are causing fires to burn faster and fiercer. For one,homes are biggerand often have open floorplans. As a result, fire spreads with fewer barriers. The open space accelerates fires by allowing for faster airflow and more oxygen. Most problematic are the materials used to decorate homes. “There’s no getting away from it,” says Drengenberg. “Homes have more synthetic materials than they did 30 years ago.” Our houses are literally filled with them: Everything from furniture and clothing to carpeting contain these fast-­burning substances. Given that our homes are literally flammable, fire prevention and awareness have never been more important. Part of that is recognizing problem areas in a household. “Cooking is the leading cause of home fires,” says Lorraine Carli, vice president of outreach and advocacy at the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA). “Frying on the stovetop and leaving that unattended is the combination that leads to the majority of home fires and [related] injuries.” Modern homes are filled with synthetic materials, such as foam and plastics, that burn faster and hotter than their organic counterparts three decades ago. Double pane windows, made by creating a vacuum between two panes of glass, are more energy-efficient but tend to fail faster when exposed to high temperatures. Open floorplans and higher ceilings provide fires with access to more oxygen and less containment, allowing them to spread quickly through a home.

For the Ware family,the fire started in a wall outlet of their sunroom. “We've lived in this house for 10 years. Never had a problem with it, nothing,” says Ware. By the time she arrived with a fire extinguisher, the fire had already gotten out of control. “The extinguisher was nowhere near enough. [The fire] had spread and was going through both walls.” Luke Wood, one of the firefighters who helped battle the Ware’s fire, says that having a plan of action is critical to a family's safety. “If you discover a fire in your home, try to isolate that fire,” he says. “If you find a fire in your bedroom, close the door and get everybody out the house. It only takes a few minutes for that fire to really develop and become a fully involved fire.” Sources: National Fire Protection Agency,All About Fire. Keith Bryant, president of the International Association of Fire Chiefs and himself the fire chief of Oklahoma City, says that fire safety also starts with a smoke alarm. “There’s really nothing else that people can do that protects themselves and their families more than a working smoke alarm,” he says. NFPA’s Carli also recommends that smoke alarms be interconnected, so that when one sounds, they all sound. The devices should also be able to detect multiple indicators of a fire, not just smoke, but also heat and carbon monoxide. Because the Ware family had a network of alarms, the fire was easy to locate. “It was a lady's voice saying that there was smoke in the [sunroom],” says Ware, who quickly realized smoke had spread throughout the house. Detection of smokeand carbon monoxide is particularly vital because smoke is more dangerous than ever. Modern households are filled with more synthetic materials made from oil and its derivatives — such as polyurethane and reconstituted soda bottles — so smoke is often tainted with toxins such as hydrogen cyanide, phosgene and carbon monoxide. In fact, according to the NFPA, most fatalities from fires are caused by smoke inhalation, not by burns. Ware’s experience was typical of a modern residential fire: “[The sunroom] was full of smoke from the ceiling to the bottom of the floor,” she says. Because of the changes to residential fires in recent years, firefighters have had to adapt their tactics. This has meant wearing advanced protective gear and getting to fires faster. “It used to be that the rule was a fire in a home would double its size every two minutes,” says Bryant. “Because of the new materials, that’s a lot quicker now. That’s why those response times are so critical.” Once firefighters arrive, they must attack the fires more efficiently than they have in the past. “The normal procedure, ever since Ben Franklin started fire departments,” says Drengenberg, “was to get up on a roof and chop a hole in it.” Cutting a hole in the roof allows firefighters to vent hazardous chemicals and smoke, as well as see how far a fire has progressed. Today, firefighters are doing things differently. “They’re seeing maybe that isn’t the best way — that it may introduce more oxygen and help it spread quicker,” says Drengenberg, who points out that masks and air packs allow firefighters more versatility than ever before. Smoke alarms, too, are changing. “As house fires have become more dangerous, firefighters have evolved — but residential fire safety equipment hadn't, and we wanted to change that with Nest Protect,” says Maxime Veron, Nest’s head of hardware product marketing. Because the Ware family had smart alarms, Tina’s husband Doug — who had already left for work — knew about the fire almost instantaneously via his smartphone: “He was already aware of [the fire] before I had even called him,” says Mrs. Ware.

They weren't coming for gourmet fare: Their descriptions of the coffee ranged from ‘horrible’ to ‘bitter’, and one parent said his daughter complained that the hot chocolate was like water. Anthony Solis, left, and Tony Gonzalez prepare their coffee at the Dumb Starbucks coffee shop Instead, they were just coming to say they came, and to score a white paper cup with a sticker bearing the curious logo. ‘It was a pretty dumb idea to come out in the cold and wait for nearly two hours to get a coffee,' joked Anthony Solis, who lives in nearby Hollywood. Before the rush, production crews came to the location several times to film, according to permits taken out with Film LA, a private non-profit that issues the licenses. The permits were billed to Abso Lutely Productions, which has produced Fielder's show. Once opened, Dumb Starbucks caught the attention of the real Starbucks. ‘While we appreciate the humor, they cannot use our name, which is a protected trademark,’ Laurel Harper, a spokeswoman for Seattle-based Starbucks Corp., said in an email. She added that most trademark disputes are handled informally, suggesting the company might not need to take legal action. Prankster: Comedian Nathan Fielder has revealed the Dumb Starbucks prank will feature on his Nathan For You show, to be aired on Comedy Central on July 29  Featured coffee drinks sizes, Dumb Venti, Dumb Grande, and Dumb Tall are displayed inside the Dumb Starbucks in Los Angeles At the front counter, a sheet of frequently asked questions said the store was shielded by ‘parody law’. ‘By adding the word 'dumb,' we are technically “making fun” of Starbucks, which allows us to use their trademarks under a law known as “fair use”,’ the sheet said. It continued: ‘In the eyes of the law, our “coffee shop” is actually an art gallery and the “coffee” you're buying is considered art. But that's for our lawyers to worry about.’ One law professor suggested Dumb Starbucks needed to sharpen its legal theory. ‘Fair use’ can protect parodies of copyright material, but a trademark such as the logo has different protections that Dumb Starbucks may well be violating, said Mark McKenna, a trademark law expert at the University of Notre Dame. Fielder, the comedian, said that he didn't need Starbucks' permission and he was glad the company had not pursued a ‘case they know they can't win’. He then revealed that city health inspectors had arrived and told his staff that they had to stop serving drinks.

Vox.com,"Content Created by WP BrandStudio While the storied Italian Mafia has lost its stronghold in the United States, its progeny remain alive and active with an estimated 3,000 members and affiliates. The FBI still calls La Cosa Nostra “the foremost organized criminal threat to American society.” Yet organized crime networks have shifted dramatically since the Mafia’s heyday. Major crime families are replaced by an intricate web of foreign nationalities that engage in everything from wire fraud to computer hacking and human trafficking. And although the FBI’s siloed response evolved to a broader interagency cooperation, numerous syndicates snake under the radar and give law enforcement a headache. Today, “the loyalties are gone. There used to be big bosses, under-bosses and soldiers. It is a much younger crowd now with smaller cells, and everybody turns on each other,” said Eric Schneider, a former associate of kingpin Whitey Bulger and Boston’s Irish mob. “The ongoing attraction to organized crime is still probably a byproduct of the past two decades of people growing up with ‘Goodfellas’ and aspiring to that life, which I don’t understand now.” Real-life and fictional gangsters continue to resonate powerfully in film and television – from Bulger biopic “Black Mass” to “American Hustle” to Esquire Network’s upcoming scripted drama series “Spotless.” Schneider worked with Bulger from 1986 until 1993 when he was arrested. To avoid a life sentence, Schneider testified against his partners. “I went against what I was brought up with – the code of silence – you kept your mouth closed.” His partners went to prison and he spent 20 years in witness protection. He recently revealed his identity in his book ""The Choir Boy."" While in decades past the FBI chased Italian and Irish mobsters, it now pursues criminals of multiple nationalities, including those who target U.S. citizens online from abroad. Since many crimes now happen online, the FBI heavily recruits tech experts and cybersecurity agents for electronic surveillance. The laundry list of organized crime in the United States is ever-growing. Adding to the traditional racketeering activities of old are drug and human trafficking, tax fraud, hacking, identity theft, securities and investment fraud, sale of untaxed merchandise and counterfeit goods, and fraudulent mortgages, insurance, credit cards, food stamps and baby formula. Groups often cooperate across ethnic and racial heritage lines, and co-mingle their illegal activities with legitimate business ventures. They’ve been identified in more than 50 metropolitan areas in the United States. Much U.S.-based organized crime has roots in families, tribes or clans in originating countries. These structures strengthen networks and perpetuate the cycle of crime. In response, the FBI dedicates its organized crime units to different ethnic and geographic categories – Italian, Asian, African, Eurasian and Middle Eastern. The FBI lacks undercover agents who speak the native language of communities and can infiltrate them without suspicion. “We don’t have enough agents who speak the languages fluently,” said Anthony Brizzolara, a retired special agent and 32-year FBI veteran. “We rely more on physical and electronic surveillance. The good news is that the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organization federal law of 1970 (RICO) has allowed agencies to significantly gut entrenched networks like the Italian and Irish by prosecuting syndicate leaders for crimes they commissioned. With RICO, law enforcement can attack an entire entity instead of imprisoning individuals, who can easily be replaced with other associates. “RICO all but destroyed traditional organized crime in America,” said Robert Lombardo, associate professor of criminology and criminal justice at Loyola University in Chicago. “The law gave us a lot more power and ability to affect change and eventually get people to roll over,” Brizzolara said. “Once the dam broke as higher level folks ‘turned,’ over time more turned, which helped turn the tide for us against [the Italian Mafia].” Yet new opportunists are always looking for ways to skirt laws. Brizzolara noted that illegal immigrants who enter through Canada and Mexico from around the world continually feed existing criminal networks. “The common denominator is that a lot of money is being funneled back to home countries, with entire families involved” in both public nuisance crimes and violent crimes like drug and human trafficking. “The FBI and other agencies target these groups and make arrests, and often the major players get deported. Six months later, they show up on surveillance. They are adept at getting back into the country,” said Dennis Franks, former FBI special agent and managing director at Risk Control Strategies in Houston. Just last year, federal, state and local officials staged a major money laundering takedown of the Sinaloa drug cartel in Los Angeles. “Mexican drug cartels are the most important organized crime challenge that we face. The DEA are the unsung heroes in the effort against the cartels,” Lombardo said. Interagency alliances against organized crime began to appear after the passage of RICO and have flourished in the post-9/11 era. “I like to think it’s changed a lot since I became an agent 32 years ago. It’s 100 times better in terms of sharing and working with other agencies. It’s better to work together and not stovepipe things,” Brizzolara said. Now that Bulger is in prison and the Boston Irish mob appears a distant memory, American groups without native ties overseas are more concentrated in home-grown hate or terrorist cells that work for political or social purposes, Brizzolara said. Although, “our prison system is a wonderful breeding ground for getting folks together who are incarcerated and of like minds to coalesce.” And that is true for criminals of any background. Whether it’s cartels, La Cosa Nostra or any insidious operation, loyalties do not always prevent groups from forming outside alliances. For example, Colombian and Mexican cartels have collaborated to smuggle cocaine to the United States. “While they might fight with each other within their country or their organizations, they become quite adept at being able to collaborate with other criminal groups,” Franks said. “Any groups can learn to adapt if it makes sense business wise.” Watch how organized crime comes between two brothers on “Spotless,” premiering Nov. 14 on Esquire Network."
Vox.com,"Content Created by WP BrandStudio While the storied Italian Mafia has lost its stronghold in the United States, its progeny remain alive and active with an estimated 3,000 members and affiliates. The FBI still calls La Cosa Nostra “the foremost organized criminal threat to American society.” Yet organized crime networks have shifted dramatically since the Mafia’s heyday. Major crime families are replaced by an intricate web of foreign nationalities that engage in everything from wire fraud to computer hacking and human trafficking. And although the FBI’s siloed response evolved to a broader interagency cooperation, numerous syndicates snake under the radar and give law enforcement a headache. Today, “the loyalties are gone. There used to be big bosses, under-bosses and soldiers. It is a much younger crowd now with smaller cells, and everybody turns on each other,” said Eric Schneider, a former associate of kingpin Whitey Bulger and Boston’s Irish mob. “The ongoing attraction to organized crime is still probably a byproduct of the past two decades of people growing up with ‘Goodfellas’ and aspiring to that life, which I don’t understand now.” Real-life and fictional gangsters continue to resonate powerfully in film and television – from Bulger biopic “Black Mass” to “American Hustle” to Esquire Network’s upcoming scripted drama series “Spotless.” Schneider worked with Bulger from 1986 until 1993 when he was arrested. To avoid a life sentence, Schneider testified against his partners. “I went against what I was brought up with – the code of silence – you kept your mouth closed.” His partners went to prison and he spent 20 years in witness protection. He recently revealed his identity in his book ""The Choir Boy."" While in decades past the FBI chased Italian and Irish mobsters, it now pursues criminals of multiple nationalities, including those who target U.S. citizens online from abroad. Since many crimes now happen online, the FBI heavily recruits tech experts and cybersecurity agents for electronic surveillance. The laundry list of organized crime in the United States is ever-growing. Adding to the traditional racketeering activities of old are drug and human trafficking, tax fraud, hacking, identity theft, securities and investment fraud, sale of untaxed merchandise and counterfeit goods, and fraudulent mortgages, insurance, credit cards, food stamps and baby formula. Groups often cooperate across ethnic and racial heritage lines, and co-mingle their illegal activities with legitimate business ventures. They’ve been identified in more than 50 metropolitan areas in the United States. Much U.S.-based organized crime has roots in families, tribes or clans in originating countries. These structures strengthen networks and perpetuate the cycle of crime.

TheDailyBeast.com,"iStockIn the world of modern business, where you are is just as important as what you do. The right location plays a big part in attracting qualified talent, allowing more collaboration, and presenting a relatable, physical association for customers and clients.Today, real estate is not necessarily seen as a source of competitive advantage – but it very much is.It's actually a tool that can drive business. Skilled real estate management is a discipline; lack of experience can have serious consequences. Both new and established companies are susceptible to bad real estate decisions without realizing the implications they can have on the business — or the value a good real estate move can offer. Here's how one company has used real estate as a successful business strategy. Young & Rubicam is one of the most recognized and respected ad agencies in the world. But a few years ago Y&R was going through changes.For more than 86 years, the agency’s global headquarters were at 285 Madison Avenue in New York City, and the space was synonymous with the agency itself. However, as Y&R continued to expand, its space on Madison avenue no longer provided the amenities it needed. Finding the right space was critical for Y&R; not only did it have to meet its expanding needs, it also had to be a space where the agency's culture, ethos, and creativity could thrive. Working withCBRE, a commercial real estate services firm, Y&Ridentified 3 Columbus Circle as the ideal site for its new global headquarters. CBRE helped Y&R secure ahybrid deal to acquire a condominium interest of floors three through eight, and enter into a 20-year lease for floors nine, 10, 18, and 19 at 3 Columbus Circle. Y&R's new offices allow for creative expression and better collaboration.CBREOne of the many draws of the new building is that it provides a number of features that are appealing to both employees and clients, including a sunlit mix of public and private space. Different pieces of art on the walls match the creativity of the campaigns that come from the agency teams. Recognizing that the office is where many employees spend most of their time, Y&R created a number of break areas: a roof deck where people can enjoy stunning views of Central Park; a cafeteria that offers a number of different dining options; and areas for employees to relax and even play foosball and shuffleboard. And it's not just the actual building that can influence employees' happiness — the location is also a big draw. The neighborhood has easy subway access, so it's convenient for employees from across the numerous New York City boroughs. Because the office is part of a hub that houses other agencies within WPP (Y&R's holding company), it creates a great space for Y&R to collaborate with colleagues at sister firms. The space has proven to be a valuable asset for Y&R, helping the firm deliver on its best-in-class creative reputation and serve as a place where both employees and clients want to be.

Mic.com,"Iâm in my fifth year of living in New York City, and I know I still havenât taken advantage of everything the city has to offer. I havenât explored the reaches of all five boroughs. I havenât seen all the landmarks. I havenât soaked up all the culture there is to soak. Yet my boyfriend is a born-and-bred NYC local, and while I would have thought that heâs been everywhere there is to go. In reality, Iâve actually shown him some spots that he had never visited before. Itâs almost impossible to be an expert on your home city. There are so many different neighborhoods; new, must-visit locations open every day. Every local you talk to has a different set of favorite places. It can be totally overwhelming. But if you really want to get to know your urban home, thereâs one foolproof way to do it: dining out. Nothing beats the authenticity of a local restaurant. Here are six reasons dining out is the best way to explore your city: In the winter months, we look out the window, and all we can do is sigh. Itâs gloomy and cold â two adjectives that are screaming, âStay home!â Weâre inclined to keep to our little bubbles and not venture out of our neighborhoods for anything beyond work. A good restaurant recommendation can change all of that, though. If you hear that thereâs great paella on the other side of town, your taste buds NEED to trek there. If your best friend is stoked about the curry in a different borough, you HAVE to try it. We will travel anywhere for a good meal. And in the process, weâre walking through new neighborhoods we wouldnât otherwise see. It could inspire us to find a new favorite street, or even move to a new area. There are certain haunts in every city that each generation of inhabitants has visited. If you ask your grandmother where to go, she might tell you to try the old Italian place with the 100-year-old Ragu recipe. Talk to your parents, and theyâll send you to the burger place that opened in the 1950s. Hitting up these restaurants is the best way to connect to older generations, in and out of your family. It also makes you a part of the fabric of your metropolis. When you cook for yourself, you cook what you know. If you were raised on spaghetti and meatballs, thatâs the recipe youâre using at the end of the day. The beauty of eating out is trying the different cultures your city houses. Mediterranean, Indian, Hawaiian, Ethiopian â itâs all there for the tasting. Itâs the most delicious way to expand your horizons. Restaurants are the city equivalent of a safari watering hole. Different types of characters come out at night, seeking sustenance. You see them all when youâre eating out. People-watching is basically a sport when you live in a city. You look around and ascribe fictional backgrounds to the eclectic mix of people you see. Itâs a free dose of fun served up with your meal. There is no better feeling than walking into a restaurant or coffee shop and the staff greeting you with open arms. If they know your name, thatâs a plus. If they know your order, thatâs a major plus. Being a regular connects to your community. You know not only the staff, but also the other regulars. You start seeing them around the neighborhood as you run errands, and you give each other a nod. Knowing how the other takes theirÂ coffee has bonded you. Letâs be honest: In your life, youâre basically just filling time in between meals. You are stoked when someone suggests it might be time to eat. So when you eat out, itâs a chance to merge your insatiable hunger with a social activity. Why play a round of mini-golf with friends when you can all break bread together? Especially if you get a good deal on a prix fixe meal. You and your friends will never regret a night out on the town with a good meal. Itâs the best way to fulfill your need to be cultured and fed."

It also makes you a part of the fabric of your metropolis. When you cook for yourself, you cook what you know. If you were raised on spaghetti and meatballs, thatâs the recipe youâre using at the end of the day. The beauty of eating out is trying the different cultures your city houses. Mediterranean, Indian, Hawaiian, Ethiopian â itâs all there for the tasting. Itâs the most delicious way to expand your horizons. Restaurants are the city equivalent of a safari watering hole. Different types of characters come out at night, seeking sustenance. You see them all when youâre eating out. People-watching is basically a sport when you live in a city. You look around and ascribe fictional backgrounds to the eclectic mix of people you see. Itâs a free dose of fun served up with your meal. There is no better feeling than walking into a restaurant or coffee shop and the staff greeting you with open arms. If they know your name, thatâs a plus. If they know your order, thatâs a major plus. Being a regular connects to your community. You know not only the staff, but also the other regulars. You start seeing them around the neighborhood as you run errands, and you give each other a nod. Knowing how the other takes theirÂ coffee has bonded you. Letâs be honest: In your life, youâre basically just filling time in between meals. You are stoked when someone suggests it might be time to eat. So when you eat out, itâs a chance to merge your insatiable hunger with a social activity. Why play a round of mini-golf with friends when you can all break bread together? Especially if you get a good deal on a prix fixe meal. You and your friends will never regret a night out on the town with a good meal. Itâs the best way to fulfill your need to be cultured and fed."
Mirror Online,"Nothing is more exhilarating than meeting a new crush. You're having a totally normal night at your friend's party when theÂ guy from across the room comes over to chat you up. You find out, shockingly, you have quite a bit in common. After you exchange numbers, you reside in the warm habitat of possibility. He hasn't screwed anything up yet or burst your expectations. Your ignorance to what your future with him may hold is bliss. Once he finally texts a few days later, you're stoked. You told your friends you didn't expect to hear from him again after your short makeout sesh, but, obviously, you were lying. You start thinking about all of the speakeasies you've been to in the past few months and mentally cataloged for first dates. Then, he drops aÂ bomb you should have seen coming:ÂâHow about we stay in and watch a movie?â He essentially just asked you to ""Netflix and chill."" Cue the whirlwind of thoughts that start circlingÂ through your mind."

NJ.com,"When my boss told me I was being sent to Chattahoochee Hills, Georgia to cover TomorrowWorld 2015, my brain couldnât work fast enough to give any response other than, âMe? Really?â Electronic dance music is one of those genres of music with a reputation. Everyone has an image in their heads of the prototypical EDM festival-goers: theyâre in their early-to-mid twenties, wearing neon and flower crowns, dancing with no abandon. Thatâs not exactly me. Iâm more acoustic guitar, less bass drop. To the point where, in telling my friends that I was covering the biggest EDM festival in the US, I got the same reaction across the board: âYou? Really?â Armed with that arsenal of glowing support, I hopped in a cab to JFK Airport absolutely terrified that I was going to stick out like a sore thumb in the TomorrowWorld crowd. Was I going to look like a narc? I immediately regretted not hitting up the craft store to fashion my very own flower crown. The nerves kept bubbling up throughout the flight to Georgia, and in the car with the Elite Daily crew as we drove out to the festival. The city scape of Atlanta transformed into farmland in the blink of an eye. I had read that TomorrowWorld USA takes place in a magical forest location, but I didnât realize that was the first step in a total break from reality."

Freep.com," Partnered content Presented by Mazda This is the first article in a four-part special advertising feature series presented by Mazda that looks at the ongoing relationship between technology, innovation and sport. Technical innovation in sport - it's something we as participants and fans take for granted now. It could be Grand Prix champion Lewis Hamilton talking to his pit crew throughout his thrilling drive in Austin Texas to win the 2015 Formula One title. Or improvements in the safety standards of cricketers' helmets, following the death of Australian Test batsman Phillip Hughes when a delivery struck him at the top of his neck, in Sydney in 2014. Perhaps the most interesting development is the introduction of ingestible computers that constantly transmit data on a player's vital functions, such as blood pressure and body temperature. Athletes in sports as diverse as motor sport, athletics, football and hockey are already using them. It's the latest innovation in the ever-changing world of sports technology. If you look at the many incredible achievements of the modern world, chances are you'll find it's a result of a potent combination of innovation and technology. This combination lets us live and move like never before. Mazda's innovation and technology has allowed them to develop the Mazda CX-3. Let's turn the clock back more than 70 years, when one of sport's greatest innovations evolved from a bitter feud between two brothers.  Adi and Rudi Dassler were partners in a sports shoe company in Herzogenaurach, Germany. After  an acrimonious split , the brothers formed rival companies - Adidas and Puma - on opposite sides of the river Aurach. The schism inspired a battle for domination in athletic footwear - firstly in newly formed West Germany, and then the rest of the world. It led to a race to find styles and materials that gave top athletes the slightest advantage. Manufacturers  are still in a fight for domination, with the global market tipped to be worth US$84.4 billion in 2018. Amazingly, Adidas and Puma are still up there fighting for their share of the lucrative sports shoe market, along with Nike, Reebok and other companies. The only objective is to win - to be bigger, stronger, faster … smarter. Athletes, teams and sports organisations will always seek to find an edge over their rivals (or the stopwatch). It might be the chance to gain a physical advantage through better training techniques, or a mental edge through superior tactics. Or it might be through playing with equipment that allows them to go faster, with more comfort and safety, for longer. At the 2015 Tour de France, for example, cyclists carried miniature GPS-equipped computers that tracked speed, distance travelled and calories burned. Technology continues to be crucial factor in any individual or team success, especially at the elite level. And as every player or team finds an advantage, opponents try to counter it. This sports innovation cycle  has made billionaires of entrepreneurs in the sports equipment industry, and created jobs for sports scientists and psychologists who deliver stunning results for athletes, teams and sponsors. The push for sporting innovation has also given spectators the chance to be more involved in the action.  Using miniature, high-speed and even infrared cameras and ultra-sensitive microphones, broadcasters and sports organisations bring fans closer to the action. Intimacy equals greater ratings and sponsorship money. When Tennis legend John McEnroe screamed 'You Cannot Be Serious' at the Umpire while contesting a decision, it added to the excitement for the Wimbledon crowd. With the introduction of Hawk-Eye in Grand Slams in 2006, we may have lost some of the human drama, but we've gained a near-faultless ball-tracking technology that enjoys the support  of most players and officials. Many sporting organisations,  including  the NFL in the US, and the Rugby Union authorities at the recent World Cup in England, use ""slo-mo"" video technology as part of their on-field decision-making, while their officials  use it to determine if players should be suspended for foul play. Technology has also had  a fundamental impact on the way players train. Cutting-edge training facilities are a home away from home for elite athletes, who rely on sophisticated machines and monitors to reach peak performance while averting the risk of injury. Sports scientists use technology to develop training regimes that allow individual athletes to perform at their best. Modern technology also allows sports to find future stars, with talented teenagers tested to determine which disciplines best suit their physiology. These days, star rowers are discovered before they even step onto a boat. But some sports testing is less about finding champions and more about exposing cheats. World anti-drug agencies strive - with varying degrees of success - to develop sophisticated tests to uncover athletes and coaches who are seeking an unfair chemical advantage. Technology has also revolutionised sports psychology. What gives players confidence, awareness, courage? How do players stop being complacent, fearful, nervous? Psychologists have learnt the answer is different for every athlete. Visualisation techniques, where players ""see"" a successful outcome before it happens, are practised by athletes at all levels. Managers and coaches increasingly use technology to help with tactics, in real time. In cricket, ball-tracking software helps bowlers find weaknesses in batting techniques. And in Australian Rules Football, live statistics help coaches find players who are getting beaten by their opponents. Motor sport is an industry almost entirely based on technology.  Grand Prix racing takes this to the furthest reaches, with competitors looking for any edge that will bring them faster  lap times measurable to one-thousandth of a second. Engine and chassis information is available in real time for drivers, team managers and  pit crews. This information is available to fans watching on television or on their computers or mobile devices. Consumers are the ultimate winners when innovations trickle down from elite competition. Motor sport has improved the efficiency and safety of road cars, and continues to be a test bed for technology. In the same way that disc brakes, advanced four-wheel drive systems and turbochargers were developed in the motor-sport crucible decades ago, the world's smartest engineers are refining hybrid engine technology, synthetic oils and fuels  to improve the cars we will drive in the future. This principle applies in all sports. The same state-of-the-art composite racquet Novak Djokovic used to win Wimbledon will win the mixed doubles final at the local tennis club. Golf equipment manufacturers, forced to abide by a strict set of global rules for elite and amateur players, endeavour to design clubs that help hackers hit the ball straighter and longer. What of the future?  Some say we're entering the age of 'smart wearables' technology, with athletes competing in outfits that transmit performance data in real time. Others believe  that nanotechnology will transform the way everyday sporting equipment is made, making it  stronger, lighter and easier to use. Hopefully, we will continue to be the beneficiaries of these advances, both as amateur competitors whose clothing and equipment are constantly improving, and as armchair fans whose enjoyment of sport is given a boost by the latest revolutionary technological advance.

Dallas Morning News,"Sponsored Content Provided by Westbury Market Fair Want to shop the tables of up to 100 vendors — selling items at up to 75% off retail? Then head to theWestbury Market Fairfor an efficient and cost-effective way to finish up that last-minute shopping. Started in March 2015 by two flea market veterans, ""Gorilla Dave"" and Dave ""With Groceries"" Algarin, the Westbury Market Fair offers a diverse, enjoyable outdoor shopping option. The culmination of years of being vendors, the two Daves wanted to continue the rich history of such flea markets past as Roosevelt Field, Aqueduct and Valley Stream. They recognized the need for vendors looking for a venue and a community looking for an old-fashioned shopping experience. We spoke with Brian Baxter, Westbury Market Fair field and marketing manager, on how the fair can help those looking for the perfect last-minute gifts. When and where does the fair take place? It's open every Saturday and Sunday from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. inthe parking lot of the NYCB Theater at 960 Brush Hollow Road in Westbury, New York. It's a great location that's easy to get to and is well known. People have been coming to the theater for 50 years, so they know it and are comfortable getting here. It's easily accessible by car or by LIRR. It's in the heart of Westbury, so if you live in Queens, Staten Island, Westchester, Nassau County or the Brooklyn area, it's easy to get to. How many and what types of vendors do you have? We have 100 on Saturdays and around 80 on Sundays. They offer a little bit of everything, and we aim to be a one-stop shop. You'll find antiques and collectibles, shoes for men, women and kids, both new and used clothing, health and beauty items, groceries. Plus, we have an ""As Seen on TV"" section and garage sale spaces, as well as tools, sporting goods, equipment and lots of home-made costume jewelry. Why is the perfect place to shop for gifts? You can come down and do all the holiday shopping in one spot and get tremendous bargains, usually 75% off most major retailers. If you come and browse the tables you'll find both new and used items, rare and unique pieces you won't find in your local department store. What are the perks of an outdoor shopping experience? For a lot of people, the whole Black Friday mall situation was intimidating and scary. There are just too many people in a confined area. Our fair is all outdoors, so it's comfortable and provides a nice change of pace. For people who want to take a break from shopping are there places to eat and drink? Yes! We like to say we have food from all nations, including a taco place, a soul food truck and sausage trucks. Plus, we have bathrooms and places to sit, so it's an enjoyable way to spend an afternoon. For more information about visiting the fair and vendor opportunities, call (516) 630-3739 or visitwww.westburymarketfair.com."
