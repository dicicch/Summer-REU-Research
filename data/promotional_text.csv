PresidentObamasaid today that he does not believe GOP frontrunnerDonald Trumpwill make it to the White House, but the real estate mogul took the remark as a compliment, saying Obama has done a ""lousy job."" ""I continue to believe Mr. Trump will not be president,"" Obama said while speaking at a press conference in Rancho Mirage, California. ""And the reason is because I have a lot of faith in the American people."" Obama told reporters he believed Americans still see the presidency as ""a serious job."" “It’s not hosting a talk show, or a reality show. It’s not promotion, it’s not marketing,” Obama said. “It’s hard and a lot of people count on us getting it right.” Obama did not, however, answer whether he believed Trump was capable of securingthe GOPnomination. The president also took a shot at the rest of the GOP field, saying “foreign observers are troubled” by the GOP's rhetoric, specifically the doubting ofclimate changeand proposals to banMuslimsfrom entering the U.S. Trump, speaking at a campaign event in South Carolina, immediately hit back, saying Obama is doing a ""lousy job."" ""He has set us back so far, and for him to actually say that is a great compliment, if you want to know the truth,"" Trump said. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

Even though the relatives and doctors of the late Supreme Court JusticeAntonin Scaliareportedly knew about his health conditions, the fact that the concerns were kept from the public is in keeping with the practices of the court, experts said. Unlike the White House, which regularly releases updates on the president's health, the Supreme Court does not have set guidelines regarding what they do and don't disclose publicly. When the 79-year-old justice wasfound dead on Saturdayin a hotel room at a luxury ranch in Texas, the county's presiding judge, Cinderella Guevara, was called and pronounced him dead. Guevara said she spoke to Scalia's doctor in Washington who told her that Scalia had been sick and had visited his office twice during the week leading up to the trip. The Associated Press reported that Guevara said the doctor told her that Scalia had a history of high blood pressure, heart trouble and was considered too weak to undergo shoulder surgery following a recent injury. Guevara told ABC News that the death certificate will say that he died of natural causes with myocardial infarction, better known as a heart attack, being a contributing factor. Dr. Sahil Parikh, an interventional cardiologist at University Hospitals Case Medical Center, never treated Scalia but said that even without knowing his specific family history, there are certain clear factors that may have contributed. Parikh said that two significant risk factors for heart disease are an individual’s age and gender, with men over 55 years old being the most at-risk group. “He clearly has some risk factors for heart disease and as those increase in number, so does your risk for having a coronary event,” Parikh told ABC News. Even though it appears that nothing had been released recently by the Supreme Court about Justice Scalia's health, there have been other disclosures made about different members of the bench. JusticeRuth Bader Ginsburg, who is now 82, has had cancer twice and made disclosures in both cases. Kate Shaw, an ABC News contributor and an assistant professor of law at the Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law in New York, said that Ginsburg has been ""very forthcoming"" with regards to her health. Ginsburg released a statement in November 2014 saying that she was going to have a heart stent implanted. ""The procedure went smoothly, and she did not miss a single day of oral arguments,"" Shaw said. Shaw also pointed out that the court released a statement after ChiefJustice John Robertssuffered a seizure in 2007. The disclosures, when they come, typically are made after an official prognosis by a doctor. ""When Chief Justice Rehnquist was diagnosed with thyroid cancer in October 2004, the Supreme Court's public information office announced the diagnosis, and further announced that he would be undergoing radiation and chemotherapy,"" Shaw said. ""He returned to the bench in March of 2005, and when he declined to announce his retirement at the end of that term -- Justice O’Connor instead announced her retirement -- the assumption was that Chief Justice Rehnquist was in good health and would continue serving,"" Shaw said. ""But his health rapidly declined in July and August, and he died on Sept. 3, 2005, creating a second vacancy for President Bush to fill."" According to a report compiled by the Congressional Research Service, 41% of the Supreme Court vacancies that occurred in the first half of the 20th century were a result of a justice dying while in office. Since then, however, Rehnquist's death was the only one for a sitting Justice since 1954, the report states. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"
CNN Network,http://sponsorcontent.cnn.com/interactive/cinemax_theknick/,"“Everything that needs to be said hasalready been said, but since no one waslistening, everything must be said again.” “Everything that needs to be said has already been said, but since no one was listening, everything must be said again.” Progress is made not only by looking to the future, but by learning from the past. In a world so technologically advanced that heart rates are shared with the flick of a wristband and doctors can identify disease through a single gene, mankind is still faced with the fundamental questions of how do you end pain, postpone death and create a better life. Season two of CinemaxâsThe Knickspotlights a range of social issues that existed in America during the 1900's. These social conflicts, which were prominent in New York City at the turn of the last century, still remain an issue today. “It is not you alone, nor I alone;Not a few races, nor a few generations, nor a few centuries;It is that each came, or comes, or shall come.” “It is not you alone, nor I alone; Not a few races, nor a few generations, nor a few centuries; It is that each came, or comes, or shall come.” The turn of the 20th century saw one of the largest movements of humanity in the history of the world. In the 30 years between 1892 and 1924, 14 million people passed through New York City's Ellis Island to enter the United States. Often carrying just a single bag on their back, immigrants were absorbed into a rapidly industrializing society. In 2014, nearly 60 million people were forcibly displaced worldwide. If these refugees, internally displaced persons and asylum seekers were to make up a nation, it would be larger than South Africa and slightly smaller than Italy. One hundred years ago, immigrants crossed the Atlantic Ocean in the hopes of finding opportunity in the New World. Today, though the destinations may have changed, the search for a new beginning remains. Whether itâs the pull of progress, the promise of peace or the simple need to survive, more people are moving today than ever recorded. Every two seconds someone is forced from their home because of conflict or persecution. The largest refugee crisis since World War II is sweeping the globe as hundreds of thousands of people flee war-torn and impoverished countries searching for a better life in Western Europe. A century ago, over 70 percent of immigrants coming to America were from Eastern and Southern Europe. Once they arrived at Ellis Island they were herded into a temporary reception hall to be tested for disease. Although the organized process has changed, the stories from now look strikingly similar to the stories of then. Photojournalist Pete Kiehart has been documenting refugees as they encountered an abruptly-closed border between Serbia and Hungary, crossed through dusty fields into Croatia, and arrived in Austria where some plan to settle.

There are more refugees in the world today than ever recorded and more than half of them are children. In 2014, 19.5 million people were forced to leave their homeland because of war, persecution or natural disaster.

Capturing the faces of Ellis Island in the early 1900âs, photographer and sociologist Lewis Hine pushed for social reform through his images of newly arrived immigrants into New York.

Deaths in one day are numberless, The hazy sun is covered by sombre clouds. The largest outbreak of the Ebola virus began in West Africa in 2014, unleashing a wave of fear across the globe. The outbreak lead to a worldwide mobilization to stop the spread of the disease. The death toll from Ebola as of September 22, 2015 stands at 11,311 with 28,355 reported cases. More than a century earlier, a similar global effort brought an end to the largest outbreak of the Bubonic Plague, which began in China and spread to nearly every continent. The Bubonic plague ultimately claimed the lives of 13 million people. Paralleled alongside never before published photos of the Bubonic Plague from the Burns Archive are Getty Images Reportage photographer Daniel Berehulak's photos from his coverage of Ebola in Liberia. Marie Raedd is carried by health workers wearing protective clothing, into an ambulance to be taken with her mother to an Ebola treatment center in Monrovia on October 01, 2014. A Liberian Red Cross burial team wearing protective clothing are disinfected on August 28, 2014 in Monrovia, Liberia. The center, a closed primary school originally built by USAID, was being used to temporarily isolate people suspected of carrying the virus. Doctor Steven Hatch, 45, dressed in protective clothing, draws blood from a patient suspected of having Ebola, to be sent to a mobile testing laboratory for an Ebola test, as he works in the high-risk suspected ward at the Bong County Ebola Treatment Unit, on October 6, 2014 in Suakoku near Gbarnga in Bong County, Liberia. The blood samples are collected from patients and sent to a US navy mobile testing laboratory based at Cuttington University, being used for Ebola testing. The Bubonic Plague slowly traveled for over 100 years spreading panic from British India, where quarantine measures provoked uprisings against colonial rule, to Hawaii where troops enforced a quarantine and torched infected buildings, all the way to San Francisco's Chinatown. The explosive outbreak of Ebola in 2014 generated a similar fear on a much shorter timeframe. Starting in Guinea, the virus quickly spread to surrounding countries, and within six months had reached the U.S. and Europe. Starting in south central China in the 1850's, it reached the international hub of Hong Kong by 1894. Commercial ships carrying rats harboring infected fleas spread the plague until it reached San Franciscoâs Chinatown in 1900. This marked the first ever plague epidemic in the United States. The most common form of plague in humans, characterized by fever, delirium, and the formation of buboes. The outbreak of Ebola in 2014 began in West Africa, before being carried to Europe and the United States by returning aid workers. The U.S. saw four confirmed cases; one led to death. Today, Ebola remains a localized issue with the disease still present in Guinea and Sierra Leone. An infectious and generally fatal disease marked by fever and severe internal bleeding, spread through contact with infected body. “Doctors 100 years ago, 200 years ago, 300 and in the past, were just as smart, just as brilliant, just as innovative as doctors are today. They worked to help and heal their patients. However, they labored under inferior knowledge and technology, and I guarantee you that 100 years from now people will look at what we're doing with the same scant eye.”— Stanley Burns, MD, FACS The Plague - With Historian Dr. Stanley B. BurnsfromCourageous StudioonVimeo. Plague is carried by rats and fleas, you think your wooden barriers arekeeping them inside? Dr.Feng just said there are no new cases.There's no need for quarantine. Plague is carried by rats and fleas, you think your wooden barriers are keeping them inside? Dr.Feng just said there are no new cases. There's no need for quarantine. “What a fearful thing is ignorance.” “What a fearful thing is ignorance.” Throughout history, the medical world has constantly searched for new ways to numb pain. In the late 19th century, cocaine was discovered in medicine and first used as a form of local anesthetic.This new drug allowed doctors to perform surgeries that had never been tried before. Physicians soon saw that with the benefits came a long list of side effects including addiction. What was once an open market for cocaine and cocaine-infused products came to an end in 1914 as the federal government stopped the unregulated sale of the drug. The need to find innovative ways to dull pain continues today. In 1996, California allowed medical marijuana to be prescribed by doctors, opening up the opportunity for this controlled substance to bring relief to patients. Since then, 22 states have followed. On January 1, 2016, New York will become the next state to allow the sale of medical marijuana. In the early 1900âs the U.S. imported between 600 and 1000 metric tons a year of raw cocaine in the form of coca. It was sold in a variety of tonics, elixirs and over-the-counter products. It was used to treat ailments ranging from toothaches and chronic pain to shyness, and to break morphine addicts of their habit. Today, medical marijuana has been used to treat everything from multiple sclerosis and epilepsy, to chronic pain and the nausea that follows chemotherapy. Despite relaxed state laws, the federal government continues to regulate marijuana as a schedule-1 drug, making it illegal to grow, possess and use anywhere in the United States. A gram of cocaine could be bought for as little as in1904, which is the equivalent of roughly$6today. A gram of medical marijuana can be bought for about today. The U.S. legal cannibus market hit$2.7 billionin2014. At the turn of the 20th century cocaine was readily available for sale in pharmacies and was used in popular products such as soft drinks. With the use of medical marijuana becoming increasingly normalized across the United States, growers are seeing a rise in demand across the country. By the late 1880's cocaine use was widespread in the U.S. The eminent neurologist William Hammond was touting it in print and lectures, assuring audiences of its benefits as a surgical painkiller and a low-dosage pick-me-up that was no more addictive than coffee or tea. Druggist sold cocaine in cigarettes, cordials and soft drinks until 1900. By 1907, New York State had regulated cocaine, requiring a doctor's prescription. Dr. William Halstead was an early champion of the drug and its use in medicine. After many experiments both on patients and himself, he soon saw the side effects first hand as he suffered from addiction. Sweeping violence and addiction led to the federal Harrison Act regulating government cocaine in 1914, and by the late 1920's cocaine had fallen out of favor except among the wealthy, Bohemian crowd. Amphetamines and heroin became the drugs of choice as prohibition swept America in the 1920's, and cocaine disappeared until it surfaced again in the 1970's disco era. By the end of 2014, an estimated 2.4 million Americans were using marijuana for medical purposes. While New York City waits for its first medical marijuana dispensaries to open, just across the river in New Jersey patients are benefiting from its medical use. Marta Portuguez who suffers from gastroparesis, fibromyalgia and intractable spasticity, says she's constantly in severe pain. She's tried many different pharmaceutical solutions from narcotic painkillers to newer synthetic drugs. For Marta, those other drugs have not worked. Every few weeks Marta, with the help of one of her family members, leaves her home and purchases medical marijuana from a dispensary in New Jersey. Her husband Rafael said she will need to stay in bed for upwards of a week to recover from a day of activity. Do No Harm - A Story About Medical MarijuanafromCourageous StudioonVimeo.

USA Today ,http://www.usatoday.com/story/money/personalfinance/2015/11/03/retiring-75-becoming-new-norm/75090832/,"For the vast majority of Americans, the career ""finish line"" is hitting a retirement number and being able to retire on their own terms. In reality, though, hitting the finish line is getting increasingly tough. Instead of the road to retirement being a straight line from Point A to B, it's often filled with twists and turns. Unexpected expenses and other rising costs are making the trek to retirement quite the challenge, according to NerdWallet's2015 New Grad Retirement Report. Based on three key findings, the graduating class of 2015 faces the very real possibility that they may not retire until the age of 75. By comparison, the average retirement age today is 62. How retiring at 75 could become a realityWhat's pushing Millenials to work until the ripe age of 75? The first big issue is the growing amount of student debt today's graduates are dealing with. Average student debt these days is $35,051, up from $29,400 just three years prior, while starting wages are up only around $1,200 since 2012. With college becoming more of a requirement than an exception to land a job where economic advancement is possible, college tuitions have been rising at a pace that's vastly outpacing wage growth and inflation. The result is more than $1.2 trillion in cumulative student loan debt. According to NerdWallet, the average student loan repayment plan was 10 years, amounting to $4,239 being repaid annually (including interest payments). All told, NerdWallet suggests that repaying student loans could reduce 2015 grads' nest eggs by nearly a third, reducing their lifetime investment-earning potential by more than $684,000 over a 50-year period. Since 2012 the amount in lost retirement savings has jumped by almost $124,000. In other words, instead of investing their savings and compounding their gains over time, grads will instead be diverting their money early in their working years (where it can be of the biggest benefit over the long run) to paying back student debt. The second big issue is that rents are rising across the nation at a much quicker pace than wages. NerdWallet notes that rent prices across the U.S. are up 11% since 2012. Rising rent prices mean recent grads need to apportion an ever-greater amount of their salaries to covering basic expenses. This leaves less money for investing, and it means a potentially longer wait to retire. Lastly, NerdWallet pinpoints a lack of trust in Wall Street and skittishness toward investing as a reason why this year's grads may have to wait until age 75 to retire. The effects of the Great Recession still ring true with today's Millennials, meaning many are holding far more in cash than they should be. The result is that average annual investment returns are expected to be down, and it could take extra years for investors with a more conservative approach to reach their retirement number. NerdWallet estimates suggest that today's grads may still be able to retire at 62, but they'd need to save 20% of their income annually and invest it as opposed to the roughly 6% that they're saving and investing today. Change what we can controlLet's face it, we can't change what we can't control. College costs aren't likely to drop anytime soon with the importance of a college education growing, and rent prices may strengthen further as interest rates rise and potential homebuyers back away from paying higher mortgage rates. Some costs are simply beyond the control of today's grads. However, there are steps to be taken that could save grads money and help them do more with what they save. NerdWallet has a couple of great suggestions, including living at home for as long as is reasonable in order to save on rent costs, as well as maximizing a 401(k) match through your employer. You certainly don't want to leave free money on the table, and should almost always consider contributing at least up to the donation match in your employer-sponsored retirement plan. But there are plenty of other suggestions that could prove valuable. For instance, how you save can make a big difference come retirement. Investing in a traditional brokerage account can expose you to taxes each and every time you sell a stock, option, or mutual fund. Although long-term capital gains taxes can be 0% for low-income individuals, you're more likely to wind up paying 15% or 20% in long-term capital gains taxes when selling long-term assets in your brokerage account. You can completely eliminate taxes by opening up and contributing to a Roth IRA. A Roth IRA allows your money to grow tax-free over your lifetime, there are no required minimum distributions beginning in the year you turn 70 1/2 like its counterpart the Traditional IRA, and there's no point at which you are no longer allowed to contribute to a Roth IRA -- unlike a Traditional IRA, where you're no longer allowed to contribute past age 70. Not having to pay any taxes could save the theoretical investors in NerdWallet's report between $200,000 and $400,000 over a lifetime. Another important question iswhatto invest in. On top of keeping your money from winding up in the government's hands, new investors have to be able to trust the stock market once more. Stocks have returned an average of 8% historically, and there will certainly be periods, such as the Great Recession, where things get a bit bumpy and uncomfortable. However, the data doesn't lie. While past performance is no guarantee of future results, all 33 stock market corrections of 10% or more in theS&P 500between 1950 and 2014 were eventually erased by bull markets. Patience has historically paid off for long-term investors who pick out high-quality companies and hold them over the long run. It's also not a bad idea for younger investors to consider a more aggressive investment approach that focuses on growth stocks because they have such a long period of time to correct any investment mistakes. Allowing winners to run for decades at a time is a powerful tool that can eliminate quite a few bad stock selections. Budgeting is another important tool that today's grads are going to want to get themselves accustomed to. Far too few people have a good grasp on their cash flow, and if you don't understand how your expenses weigh on your income, then you'll have a very difficult time saving for your future. Developing a monthly budget should help boost your saving efficiency, and it'll still give you the ability to play around with the numbers to ensure you continue to live a fun life, even while budgeting for your future. Lastly, considermonetizing your hobbies. Today's Millennials really value their free time -- and their free time could actually be worth a boatload of money. Teaching guitar lessons, couponing to save at the grocery store, buying items at a garage sale then reselling them online, and pet sitting are all examples of personal hobbies that could turn into lucrative side businesses for today's grads. Plus, doing what you love certainly doesn't seem like work! Adding this extra cash to your monthly income stream could be the boost you need to move your retirement date forward. I believe there are a lot of variables left to play out between now and when today's grads hit 75. Following these suggestions could help get today's grads back on track to retiring on their own terms. The $15,978 Social Security bonus most retirees completely overlookIf you're like most Americans, you're a few years (or more) behind on your retirement savings. But a handful of little-known “Social Security secrets” could help ensure a boost in your retirement income. In fact, one MarketWatch reporter argues that if more Americans knew about this, the government would have to shell out an extra $10 billion annually. For example: one easy, 17-minute trick could pay you as much as $15,978 more... each year!

New York Times,http://paidpost.nytimes.com/cole-haan/grit-and-grace.html,"cole-haan Paid Post Share By T Brand Studio Photography by Peter Ross POINTE SHOES LOOK DECEPTIVELY SIMPLE.Covered in satin, their appearance embodies the ethereal aesthetic of the dancers and the ballets they perform. But the shoes’ sleek exterior belies both their complex construction and the meticulous preparatory ritual that are integral to their function. The box — the hardened, flat front of the shoe that allows a ballerina to rise up onto her toes, to dance en pointe — comes in varying sizes and angles. Likewise, the shank — the inner sole that provides support for the arch — can be customized for thickness, flexibility and length. Countless other elements can be fine-tuned, too, from the amount of glue used to bond the components to the material for the drawstring. Young dancers typically buy standardized pointe shoes from a store, but experienced ballerinas, like those at New York City Ballet, have theirs custom-made to accommodate every imaginable variable. “Makers” craft the shoes, which can cost upwards of $80 per pair, to the ballerinas’ specifications. Getting the fit right is vital, given the 40 or so hours a week the dancer will spend in pointe shoes. But even custom-made shoes aren’t quite perfect. Dancers scratch the soles for better traction, crush the box to soften it, and attach their own ribbons at just the right spots before beginning their own unique rituals — filled with creative MacGyvering and artistic repurposing — for putting the shoes on. Megan Fairchild, a principal dancer at New York City Ballet since 2005, starts with clear medical tape, wrapping certain toes to prevent blisters. She places a wedge-shaped make-up sponge between her first and second toes for cushioning, then a paper towel partially under the ball of her left foot. She folds the left edge over to the center, then the right edge over to meet it before pulling the excess at the tip down. All of this happens before she puts her foot into the shoe and secures it with ribbons. Then she repeats an altered version of the routine on her other foot. Preparing a pointe shoe is a remarkably manual process, made all the more remarkable when you consider that the shoes are built for only a few hours of use. Expose the shoes to a bit of sweat or a particularly pointe-heavy ballet — both of which soften the supportive materials — and they might not make it to their second hour before they are deemed “dead” and have to be repaired or retired. But the time and effort ballerinas spend preparing their shoes barely holds a candle to the time and effort they put into preparing their other primary tool: their bodies. Indeed, many dancers describe these two instruments as a single tool, with the pointe shoes functioning as an extension of their legs and feet. The rigorous training schedule followed by the 91 male and female dancers at New York City Ballet can include up to five hours a day of class — a dancer’s preparation for their day of dancing — plus rehearsal. On performance days, dancers warm up for two to three hours before going on stage. It’s a routine they repeat six days a week, with only Mondays off. Though schedules vary, they can include as much as 40 hours a week of dancing. Even on the rare occasion that the dancers’ bodies are at rest, their minds are not. A 2004 study by the University College of London showed that dancers’ mirror neurons fire while watching dance, not just while dancing. This means that as they sit along the edge of the rehearsal studio — changing their shoes or taking a break to hydrate — dancers are still actively learning, absorbing and rehearsing. A ballet life is undoubtedly demanding, but many dancers don’t see it as a sacrifice. Because daily dance has been a part of their routine since childhood, there’s rarely a sense of lost normalcy. This is their normal. Sara Mearns, a dancer with NYCB since 2004 and a principal dancer since 2008, compares morning class to brushing her teeth: “You have to do it every day, for your body.” Indeed, dancing requires — and often exceeds — the physical demands of a many professional sports. “They’re running, jumping, turning, stretching, lifting, lowering, rolling,” says Marika Molnar, director of physical therapy for New York City Ballet, who has been with the company for more than 30 years. “They are in amazing shape.” “It’s a really crazy balance between artistry and athleticism,” says Gretchen Smith, 26, who joined NYCB as member of the corps de ballet in 2006. “People are slowly recognizing it, but we really do want to be acknowledged as athletes.” After watching these athletes move and learning how they prepare, it’s easy to believe that the human body is limitless. But its limits are real, and pushing any body to those limits will inevitably result in pain. “I don’t remember the last time I woke up and felt fantastic,” Megan says. “There’s pain every day.” YOU CANNOT DO THIS WITHOUT PAIN. I THINK YOU SICKLY GET USED TO IT. Differentiating pain that is part of the process from pain that constitutes an injury in need of rest or treatment can, at times, be difficult. “Pain typically starts from the moment I get out of bed,” Gretchen says. “You cannot do this without pain. I think you sickly get used to it.” Marika says that education is key to helping dancers understand their bodies enough to properly interpret and address pain. Through meetings with specialized staff, a series of lectures by a health team, and one-on-one attention during daily physical therapy sessions, the dancers learn the language of anatomy. This not only helps them speak effectively with doctors and therapists, but also helps them understand how certain muscles, ligaments and joints work — or, on bad days, don’t work — so they can perform through pain in a healthy way and prevent injury. That anatomical knowledge is vital. For ballerinas, the tiniest shift in balance on a landing can divert the pressure of impact from the toes — encased in the protective box of the pointe shoe — up through the ankle, knee, hip and back, increasing the risk of more serious injuries. As a result, ankle injuries are among the most common for ballet dancers, Marika says, followed by back and hip injuries. Luckily, most are not career-ending. Due in large part to ongoing education efforts, improvements in treatment, and a relaxation of the taboo against admitting to pain, Marika says, she sees fewer major injuries than she used to. In fact, she adds, some dancers find that their dancing benefits from their time off for recuperation. “I think they would all agree that they actually learn a lot when they have an injury,” Marika says. They learn about their bodies and their limits through physical therapy and other care, and they re-enter the studio with a heightened sense of how far they can realistically push themselves. “They’re better when they get back,” she says. Click to expand Sara found this to be true when she returned after eight months off to recover from a back injury. “Your body changes after an injury,” she says. “You find new weaknesses and new strengths.” Whether a dancer ever suffers a major injury or not, the years of rigorous rehearsal and the accumulation of smaller strains can wear the body down. “Between 18 and 40 is career time,” Marika says. As dancers age, they develop a maturity in their art that makes them even more expressive, but age undoubtedly makes it harder to keep up with younger dancers who may be able to turn faster and jump higher. While 28 isn’t “old,” Sara says, you can’t deny that your body starts to react differently as you age, triggering thoughts of what the next chapter might be. “We live our lives in seasons now,” Gretchen says, “but at some point, you realize that this isn’t going to last forever.” While the toll of relentless rehearsal and performance may ultimately contribute to a decision to end a dancing career, that same training also ingrains in dancers the skills needed to not only survive, but thrive, in whatever chapter comes next. Constant self-assessment and rigorous rehearsals teaches them discipline. Recovering from injuries strengthens their resilience and reinforces the importance of recognizing limits. With those traits and knowledge, Marika says, “they can do pretty much anything after they dance.” For many, she says, the hardest part is transitioning to a life without dance when it has consumed so much of their life and represented so much of their identity for so long. That’s why many dancers are encouraged to explore passions and connections outside of the ballet world. “It’s really sacred for me. I feel like when I’m here, I’m fully here,” Gretchen says of the rehearsal studio. “But it’s so important to me to make sure that I have some nutrients outside of work, too.” During whatever downtime can be found between rehearsals and New York City Ballet’s 160 public performances at the David H. Koch Theater Lincoln Center this year, many dancers take college courses, visit family, spend time with friends and pursue hobbies. Some of their outside activity is dance-related or a result of their work with the company, such as promotional photo shoots. A few also model clothing and shoes for retailers, or help with motion tracking for dance-related films. Megan will make her Broadway debut in the revival of On The Town, which entered previews on September 20 at the Lyric Theatre. She is also a teaching fellow at the School of American Ballet, the official school of NYCB. She hopes to be able to help prepare the next generation of NYCB dancers when her own teachers have moved on. She’s also pursuing a degree in math and economics at Fordham University, preparing for what she calls her “back-up, back-up plan” to become an actuary. Like many dancers, Megan, 30, is also trying to balance dance with the pressing realities of a relationship and a family. She and her husband, Andrew Veyette — also a principal dancer in the company — want to have kids, but that’s something that will have to be planned for and discussed. “You don’t know if you’re allowed to have a normal life, but you have to give yourself permission,” she says. “Because if you don’t have a life outside of ballet, you really have nothing to dance about.” Director - Alec Helm Executive Producer - Kaylee King-Balentine Writer - Melanie Deziel Creative Director - Rachel Gogel Art Director - Michael Ryterband Photographer - Peter Ross Producer - Alex Casner  The news and editorial staffs of The New York Times had no role in this post’s creation."
New York Times,http://paidpost.nytimes.com/nest/in-a-flash.html,"Nest Paid Post Share Tina Ware woke up early that morning to the sound of her smoke alarm. She had no idea how fast the fire would grow. Sparked by a faulty plug in another room, flames spread quickly, filling the house with smoke. “It was so thick,” she says. “We were coughing — you couldn’t breathe.” It was clear she had to get the kids to safety. “It was panic. We didn’t know what to do,” she says. “We had to get out of there.” She and her family escaped into the chilly February air, only to watch their 15-year-old home in Church Hill, Tenn., go up in flames. The speed of theWare’s fire was no exception. Homes built in recent decades burn up to eight times faster than comparable homes built between 1950 and 1970,according to a s​tudyby Underwriters Laboratories, a not-for-profit provider of product safety and certification testing services. “Thirty years ago, you had roughly 17 minutes to get out before your life was in complete danger. Today that 17 minutes is down to three or four,” says John Drengenberg, UL engineer and consumer safety director. Many factors are causing fires to burn faster and fiercer. For one,homes are biggerand often have open floorplans. As a result, fire spreads with fewer barriers. The open space accelerates fires by allowing for faster airflow and more oxygen. Most problematic are the materials used to decorate homes. “There’s no getting away from it,” says Drengenberg. “Homes have more synthetic materials than they did 30 years ago.” Our houses are literally filled with them: Everything from furniture and clothing to carpeting contain these fast-­burning substances. Given that our homes are literally flammable, fire prevention and awareness have never been more important. Part of that is recognizing problem areas in a household. “Cooking is the leading cause of home fires,” says Lorraine Carli, vice president of outreach and advocacy at the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA). “Frying on the stovetop and leaving that unattended is the combination that leads to the majority of home fires and [related] injuries.” Modern homes are filled with synthetic materials, such as foam and plastics, that burn faster and hotter than their organic counterparts three decades ago. Double pane windows, made by creating a vacuum between two panes of glass, are more energy-efficient but tend to fail faster when exposed to high temperatures. Open floorplans and higher ceilings provide fires with access to more oxygen and less containment, allowing them to spread quickly through a home.

For the Ware family,the fire started in a wall outlet of their sunroom. “We've lived in this house for 10 years. Never had a problem with it, nothing,” says Ware. By the time she arrived with a fire extinguisher, the fire had already gotten out of control. “The extinguisher was nowhere near enough. [The fire] had spread and was going through both walls.” Luke Wood, one of the firefighters who helped battle the Ware’s fire, says that having a plan of action is critical to a family's safety. “If you discover a fire in your home, try to isolate that fire,” he says. “If you find a fire in your bedroom, close the door and get everybody out the house. It only takes a few minutes for that fire to really develop and become a fully involved fire.” Sources: National Fire Protection Agency,All About Fire. Keith Bryant, president of the International Association of Fire Chiefs and himself the fire chief of Oklahoma City, says that fire safety also starts with a smoke alarm. “There’s really nothing else that people can do that protects themselves and their families more than a working smoke alarm,” he says. NFPA’s Carli also recommends that smoke alarms be interconnected, so that when one sounds, they all sound. The devices should also be able to detect multiple indicators of a fire, not just smoke, but also heat and carbon monoxide. Because the Ware family had a network of alarms, the fire was easy to locate. “It was a lady's voice saying that there was smoke in the [sunroom],” says Ware, who quickly realized smoke had spread throughout the house. Detection of smokeand carbon monoxide is particularly vital because smoke is more dangerous than ever. Modern households are filled with more synthetic materials made from oil and its derivatives — such as polyurethane and reconstituted soda bottles — so smoke is often tainted with toxins such as hydrogen cyanide, phosgene and carbon monoxide. In fact, according to the NFPA, most fatalities from fires are caused by smoke inhalation, not by burns. Ware’s experience was typical of a modern residential fire: “[The sunroom] was full of smoke from the ceiling to the bottom of the floor,” she says. Because of the changes to residential fires in recent years, firefighters have had to adapt their tactics. This has meant wearing advanced protective gear and getting to fires faster. “It used to be that the rule was a fire in a home would double its size every two minutes,” says Bryant. “Because of the new materials, that’s a lot quicker now. That’s why those response times are so critical.” Once firefighters arrive, they must attack the fires more efficiently than they have in the past. “The normal procedure, ever since Ben Franklin started fire departments,” says Drengenberg, “was to get up on a roof and chop a hole in it.” Cutting a hole in the roof allows firefighters to vent hazardous chemicals and smoke, as well as see how far a fire has progressed. Today, firefighters are doing things differently. “They’re seeing maybe that isn’t the best way — that it may introduce more oxygen and help it spread quicker,” says Drengenberg, who points out that masks and air packs allow firefighters more versatility than ever before. Smoke alarms, too, are changing. “As house fires have become more dangerous, firefighters have evolved — but residential fire safety equipment hadn't, and we wanted to change that with Nest Protect,” says Maxime Veron, Nest’s head of hardware product marketing. Because the Ware family had smart alarms, Tina’s husband Doug — who had already left for work — knew about the fire almost instantaneously via his smartphone: “He was already aware of [the fire] before I had even called him,” says Mrs. Ware. Tap icons for more. Benjamin Franklin envisioned the first fire department. Seeing that volunteers weren’t enough, Franklin suggested a “club or society of active men belonging to each fire engine; whose business is to attend all fires with it whenever they happen."" Sources:The Writings of Ben Franklin, Vol 2 After the Great Fire of London, the city installed water mains that could be accessed via the street. Post-­style fire hydrants, however, appeared in 1801, when the chief engineer of the Philadelphia Water Works added a hose outlet to his design.

Manby’s extinguisher was made out of copper and filled with potassium carbonate and compressed air. Sources:Fire Extinguisher Though a rudimentary smoke detector was first created in 1890, modern smoke alarms weren’t mass-produced until the mid­-'60s, when Duane D. Pearsall invented an easily replaceable battery-powered design. Source:Smoke Detector In 2013, the Wi-Fi-connected Nest Protect launched, making it possible to send a phone alert with critical information if there’s a problem at home.  As TINA Warealluded to, the Nest Protect smoke and carbon monoxide alarm speaks with a human voice during an alarm, so it can communicate information instead of just beeping. “W​hen someone has only minutes to react to a fire emergency and get out safely, having a smoke alarm that can clearly tell you which room a problem started in can make a lifesaving difference,” says Veron. Nest Protect can send information about a potential fire straight to your phone, if Internet and Wi-Fi are working at the time of the alarm. The battle plan for fighting fires in the modern age requires a mix of advanced technology, practical safety tips and creative thinking. “Things are so cheaply built nowadays that it just takes a little bit of fire to get into an attic or crawl space — if it gets in there, it's going to go,” says Wood. Preventative measures, starting with a working smoke alarm and a well­-​rehearsed escape plan, will maximize every second of the three minutes that can stand between life and death. “What saved [the Ware family],” says Wood, “was that they had smoke detectors.

Mail Online / Daily Mail,http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-3415965/How-lead-balanced-lifestyle-lose-lbs-WITHOUT-giving-social-life-Nutritionist-tips-getting-right.html," Sponsored by Diageo  ByMartha De Lacey For Mailonline Published:18:59 EDT, 2 February 2016|Updated:11:45 EDT, 3 February 2016  13 Viewcomments  Following the usual excesses of the festive period (thank heavens THAT's over), it's time for February, a more sensible month, during which our more sustainable New Year's resolutions begin in earnest. And for many (read: most) of us, that means getting into shape and thinking more about our health. Happily, being healthy doesn't mean locking oneself in the bedroom, taking the phone off the hook and avoiding all social contact. You can maintain a social life and be healthy - it is all about finding a balance In fact, maintaining a robust and varied extra-curricular life is instrumental in preserving mental wellbeing, and alcohol in moderation can have a number of benefits. 'Most of us are aware that the best option for health and weight is to cut back on alcohol,' says Jo Lewin, Community Nutritionist at the Brighton and Hove Food Partnership. 'But enjoying alcohol sensibly, in moderation, is one of life's joys.' Hear, hear. And so here are some ways to keep the joy in our lives in a healthy and responsible way (and even maybe lose a few lbs in the process...): That's the spirit! Alcoholic drinks are made by fermenting and distilling starch and sugar, so can be high in calories. A pint of beer can have the same number of calories as a slice of pizza, and a glass of wine as four biscuits, according to Drinkaware. But where beer and wine are also packed with carbohydrate and sugar, distilled spirits such as vodka, gin, rum and whisky contain far fewer. If you want to keep calories in check and an eye on your alcohol units - spirits are the way to go 'If you're watching your weight it's a good idea to opt for high-quality spirits, which are lower in calories, sugar and carbs,' advises Lewin. 'At just 52 calories (0.9 units) per 25ml, you can see how they are a more sensible option than a large glass of wine (3.1 units and 182 calories) or a pint of beer (2.3 units, 187 calories).' Drink spirits neat over ice or with a diet soft drink or soda and you'll skip all the calories of sugary or creamy mixers too (Coca-Cola has 139 calories per serving, but Coke Zero has none). A serving of diet tonic water has only 6 calories, compared to non-diet's 130. Plus, ice is a great way to ensure you're drinking some water while you're drinking alcohol. A Whisky Ginger (recipe below), made with Johnnie Walker a high quality blend Scotch and diet ginger ale, is a terrific cocktail that tastes really special but is still light and refreshing and packs less than a third of the calorific punch of a pint of beer. Quality, not quantity When it comes to alcohol always go for the highest quality you can. Enjoy it, savour it - but don't down it! Chose high quality spirits in every drink and you won't regret it. It's better to treat yourself to a few drinks you really adore than to wolf down lots you don't like: you'll linger over your favourite drink and savour it slowly. You won't knock it back fast so as not to taste it. If you are out, order your drink specifying your chosen spirit by name or brand to make sure the bar tender doesn't throw in a cheaper version. You'll find plenty of recipes for delicious, decadent cocktails onThe Bar– we're big fans of the Caipirinha, Mojito, Margarita and Old Fashioned – as well as more calorifically abstemious options, such as the vodka and diet tonic (just 54 calories a glass) and the Tall Coconut, which is also loaded with antioxidants, thanks to the fresh coconut water (recipes below). TOP TIP: It's an urban myth that drinking through a straw gets you drunker faster because you're also inhaling oxygen bubbles, but it is true that drinking through a straw makes you drink faster. Sip your drink slowly from the glass and you'll enjoy it more, drink less, and avoid slurring your words.  Don your dancing shoes Getting fit and burning calories doesn't have to be boring - it can be part of your night out! Stage your night out somewhere you can dance – a music concert, a club, a salsa bar – and you'll burn off between 300 and 600 calories per hour. Moderate yourself 'The key to enjoying a drink, as with most things in life, is moderation,' says Lewin. 'Telling yourself that you are never, ever going to drink alcohol again isn't realistic for most of us. In fact, by forbidding certain foods and drinks, they become more desirable so it's more likely you'll give in, eat more, feel guilty and give up altogether! An 'all or nothing' approach is unlikely to lead to long-term success or a healthy, balanced diet. Instead, stick to the guidance and drink in moderation and consume healthy portion sizes. That way you will really savour the taste and enjoy the treat.' Don't binge 'Binge drinking is described as drinking more than six units of alcohol in one sitting - that's only around two large glasses of wine,' explains Lewin. Binge drinking raises the amount of alcohol in your bloodstream very quickly, which can be dangerous. It's a much better idea to pace yourself slowly with a few truly special drinks you love than to inhale the whole drinks cabinet. Count your units According to the NHS, men and women are advised to drink no more than 14 units, but it's very easy to dance right over this recommendation if you're not keeping track. Use the onlineDrinks Calculatorto quickly and simply monitor your intake, to find out how many calories are in your favourite tipple, and to learn how long it will be before the alcohol leaves your system. Nifty. Alternatively, monitor your intake over a longer period by signing up toDrinkaware. Be mindful You don't have to totally shun restaurants, dinner parties and lunch dates in order to maintain a healthy lifestyle You don't have to totally shun restaurants, dinner parties and lunch dates in order to maintain a healthy lifestyle. Instead, be mindful about ordering. There are plenty of simple habits to adopt to reduce additives, saturated fat, sugar and salt inyour diet. Here are a few: An added benefit is food – especially high-protein food – slows down the rate of alcohol absorption, so your liver (which can only digest one unit per hour) will be able to handle the load, and you'll be able to keep the evening going longer. Water yourself well Alcohol is very dehydrating, acting as a diuretic – hence the hangover headaches the next morning. So ensure you drink plenty of water alongside your stronger beverages (and before you go to bed) to combat this and replace lost fluids. 'Alternate every alcoholic drink with a glass of water,' advises Lewin. 'And drink spritzers with soda or sparkling mineral water to reduce the amount of wine you drink and to keep yourself hydrated.' Filling yourself up with refreshing water will also stop you drinking too much booze.  Smirnoff & Diet Tonic Calories:54 Alcoholic units:1  A crisp and refreshing Smirnoff vodka and diet tonic contains fewer calories than a glass of apple juice and no sugar or carbs. Keep the vodka high quality and pure and you'll avoid the dreaded 'cheap booze headache' the next morning. Pack the glass with ice and a lemon slice and you'll keep yourself zingy all night. Gordons & Diet Tonic Calories:54 Alcoholic units:1 Crisp, refreshing and bursting with natural botanicals, there's a reason the gin and tonic is many people's favourite tipple. Tall Coconut Calories:116 Alcoholic units:1  Mixing coconut water with one unit of Smirnoff vodka, a little agave nectar for sweetness, and the superfood blueberries, makes this dream of a drink light, fresh and pure. Why not try a Whisky Ginger made with Johnnie Walker and diet ginger ale? Coconut water is the second most hydrating liquid on the planet, after water, and Agave nectar has a low-glycemic index, meaning you won't experience the sharp rise and fall in energy as you do consuming sugar. Johnnie Walker Whisky Ginger  Calories:59 (provided you use low calorie ginger ale) Alcoholic units:1 Low in alcohol and very low in sugar if you ensure the ginger ale is diet, a whisky ginger, made with Johnnie Walker whisky, is a tangy easy-drinker that tastes much more impressive than it should do, given how easy it is to make.   Gimlet Calories:69 Alcoholic units:1   Classically made with lime cordial, swap this for fresh lime and remove the sugar and you'll reduce the calorie content of this refreshing Gordon's London Dry Gin drink to the same as a gin and slimline tonic.  And the fresh lime will make it punchy!   Vary your social life Not every social event revolves around food or booze. There are sports teams to join, musical instruments to pick up (ukulele group, anyone?), book groups to start and art classes in which to learn a new skill. Find an activity you adore - whether it's knitting, choir, pottery, netball, wild swimming, amateur dramatics or film criticism - and you will, most likely, meet likeminded people you'll adore just as much. A great way to maintain a good balance is to make sure your social life contains lots of things that don't revolve around food or alcohol - why not try a life drawing session with friends? Volunteering, taking a course in a new subject or going to see a play or some stand-up comedy are all excellent ways to broaden your horizons and keep your mind as healthy as your body. Sure, there will be alcohol at some of these events, but it isn't the event's main focus  Take a break Sticking to a strict health kick can be overwhelming, stressful, boring and even depressing. Allowing yourself the occasional 'cheat day' will satisfy your cravings and prevent certain foods and drinks from becoming 'forbidden', and thus all the more tempting. Don't be afraid to treat yourself occasionally. Remember - everything in moderation, including moderation Being too perfectionistic about a healthy eating plan can become dangerously all-consuming, leading to orthorexia, an obsession with eating only foods the sufferer deems 'healthy' and 'clean'. This can lead to the omission of entire food groups within a diet, causing deficiencies in vital vitamins, minerals and nutrients, leading to an entirely new set of health problems far more serious than your skinny jeans being a little tight after Christmas. Treating yourself to a meal out with friends or a delicious lunch on the weekend is likely to help you stick to your healthy eating plan for longer, and in a more sensible and genuinely healthy way.

Nathan Fielder – star of Comedy Central show Nathan For You – has confessed it was widely believed that there was a political message behind the stunt, which saw free drinks served from the corner of an otherwise uncelebrated strip mall. Scroll down for video Nathan Fielder stands outside the Dumb Starbucks store which attracted media attention from over the world He also said people thought the pretend store, which took the name of the coffee giant, was the work of anonymous artist Banksy. Nathan said: ‘That was great - he's one of the greatest artists, and he's so cool. He's famous and I'm doing something that's stupid. So it's great - I'll take that; that's cool.’ What the thousands of customers lining up to buy ‘horrible’ and ‘bitter’ coffee didn’t know about the shop, which was registered as an art gallery to get round copyright laws, is that they were part of the bigger picture. And all will be revealed on the new series of his TV show, set to air on July 29. Nathan added: ‘Probably what a lot of people don't know is that it was done for an episode of Nathan For You.’  People lining up at Dumb Starbucks coffee in Los Angeles. The store resembled a Starbucks with a green awning and mermaid logo, but with the word 'Dumb' attached above the Starbucks sign  Nathan kept the crowds guessing for several days before revealing he was behind the Dumb Starbucks coffee shop in February. Keeping a straight face, Canadian comic Fielder told a crowd he was pursuing the ‘American dream’. Soon after, Los Angeles County health inspectors shut it down for operating without a valid permit. For much of the weekend, a line from the store wound alongside the parking lot and up the block. Some patrons snapped pictures in front of a green awning and mermaid logo that is familiar - except that the word ‘Dumb’ was prominently featured. They weren't coming for gourmet fare: Their descriptions of the coffee ranged from ‘horrible’ to ‘bitter’, and one parent said his daughter complained that the hot chocolate was like water. Anthony Solis, left, and Tony Gonzalez prepare their coffee at the Dumb Starbucks coffee shop Instead, they were just coming to say they came, and to score a white paper cup with a sticker bearing the curious logo. ‘It was a pretty dumb idea to come out in the cold and wait for nearly two hours to get a coffee,' joked Anthony Solis, who lives in nearby Hollywood. Before the rush, production crews came to the location several times to film, according to permits taken out with Film LA, a private non-profit that issues the licenses. The permits were billed to Abso Lutely Productions, which has produced Fielder's show. Once opened, Dumb Starbucks caught the attention of the real Starbucks. ‘While we appreciate the humor, they cannot use our name, which is a protected trademark,’ Laurel Harper, a spokeswoman for Seattle-based Starbucks Corp., said in an email. She added that most trademark disputes are handled informally, suggesting the company might not need to take legal action. Prankster: Comedian Nathan Fielder has revealed the Dumb Starbucks prank will feature on his Nathan For You show, to be aired on Comedy Central on July 29  Featured coffee drinks sizes, Dumb Venti, Dumb Grande, and Dumb Tall are displayed inside the Dumb Starbucks in Los Angeles At the front counter, a sheet of frequently asked questions said the store was shielded by ‘parody law’. ‘By adding the word 'dumb,' we are technically “making fun” of Starbucks, which allows us to use their trademarks under a law known as “fair use”,’ the sheet said. It continued: ‘In the eyes of the law, our “coffee shop” is actually an art gallery and the “coffee” you're buying is considered art. But that's for our lawyers to worry about.’ One law professor suggested Dumb Starbucks needed to sharpen its legal theory. ‘Fair use’ can protect parodies of copyright material, but a trademark such as the logo has different protections that Dumb Starbucks may well be violating, said Mark McKenna, a trademark law expert at the University of Notre Dame. Fielder, the comedian, said that he didn't need Starbucks' permission and he was glad the company had not pursued a ‘case they know they can't win’. He then revealed that city health inspectors had arrived and told his staff that they had to stop serving drinks.

Gone are the days when an online connection was confined to just your computer – now you can have everything from your refrigerator to your record player use the internet. And the chances are, you already have a lot of the necessary technology in your home. With a few simple tweaks, it’s now possible to hook households up to get the newest tech – with the strongest WiFi signal – around the home. We investigate how…  Scroll down for video What WiFi looks like: While we obviously can't see WiFi signals, one artist has created this amazing images of what signals would look like if we could. The WiFi pulses are shown here as spheres. Lamm used red, orange, yellow and other colors to represent these invisible channels that make up the overall WiFi signal.  If things really are bad, then it might be worth considering buying a booster. However, before you do, it's worth doing a bit of hunting online, as in many cases its possible to use an old router as a booster, simply by ticking a couple of boxes on its settings. If you have a second router that's only about a year old, it can probably be set to operate in 'access point' or repeater mode. Configuring is often as simple as clicking a button It's also worth checking your other WiFi kit - for instance, some Sonos WiFi enabled speakers such as the Playbar, below, can also double as a signal booster. The Sonos Playbar. some Sonos kit can also act as a signal booster for your WiFi signal. If you're a T-Mobile customer, there's also another option - the Personal CellSpot. This piece of kit can be used to maximize your personal coverage, even beyond the reach of any cellular network, which means where you have blackspots in your home - for example in the basement - you could now enjoy great coverage. The Personal CellSpot can optimise WiFi calling and give you faster data, and simply plugs in.  If you've got an old iPad or iPhone lying around, it's relatively simple to turn it into a security camera without having to spent hundreds of dollars on new kit. Free apps such asPresencecan send a live stream to you wherever you are. It provides a live stream from the area you want to monitor. You can set it up to record video clips when it detects motion, too. If you buy a robotic viewing stand for about $100, you can even move the camera 360 degrees rather than stick with a stationary view.   WiFi signals use very low intensity radio waves. Whilst similar in wavelength to domestic microwave radiation, the intensity of WiFi radiation is 100,000 times less than that of a domestic microwave oven.  Sitting in a WiFi hotspot for a year results in receiving the same dose of radio waves as making a 20 minute mobile phone call.  As with everything in technology, things change quickly - and WiFi standards are no exception. The good news is that you may even be able to do this for free. Check with the firm that makes your router to see if they have a firmware update available. This will update your router's software, and can often have a big effect on its speed and range. It's also worth considering a new handset. For instance, the new iPhone 6 handsets offer a new standard called 802.11ac, which offers far faster connection speeds that the iPhone 5s, which only had 801.11n.  However, be warned, there are a plethora of terrible acronyms to deal with when it comes to WiFi standards. In general, wireless A, B, and G are old and slow, and wireless n or ac will give you the fastest speeds around. Note that you'll need both a compatible router and card in your computer or phone if you want the full speed boost.   One of the best ways to improve your home WiFi is to change the channel it uses. WiFi uses a spectrum of frequency space, and each has different channels that can be used. Most routers are using the 2.4GHz band and there is a total of 14 channels for this band, though only 13 (or less) are mostly used throughout the world. However, the problem is that many routers are configured to use the same channel. In a place such as a large apartment block where there are many routers, this can cause major congestion. Apps such as the free WiFi Analyzer for Android can help to pick the best channel for your home WiFi Other WiFi networks will interfere with your WiFi signal, causing it to go slow. However, changing channels is relatively simple, and free apps can show you exactly which channels are in use, helping you choose the best one. One neat trick is to use your phone to do this - apps such asWifi Analyzeron Android will do this for free.  It's the cry of IT departments everywhere - have you tried switching it off and on again? Yet most of the time, it works. With WiFi routers, resetting the device every now and again isn't a bad idea, and some experts even recommend it. By resetting the router, you are forcing the router to reconnect to your service provider - which can often result in a boost to speed. Simply switching your router off and on again can often be a sure fire way to solve basic problems.   Admittedly most routers aren't the prettiest pieces of kit - but that doesn't mean you should hide them behind the TV cabinet. Experts say the key if you want the best signal is to have the router out in the open, free of any walls and obstructions. Point the antennas vertically, and elevate the router if you can. Jason Cole, a PhD physics student at the John Adams Institute at Imperial College London, turned to mathematics to find out how he could improve his internet connection. Using something known as the Helmholtz equation, which can resolve physical problems in both space and time, Mr Cole simulated his flat in a program called Matlab. In the simulation he mapped out his flat and then created a virtual router and computer, shown below.   He suggests that the only solution to ensure as few blackspots as possible is to place the router in the middle of the flat. 'It turned out that the model I developed was very sensitive to every little detail, so it was difficult to say other than the common sense advice: direct line-of-sight to the router is best,' he explains. 'There is also some reflection of the signal around corners, but engineers tell me reflections are bad too. 'In my case, the best position was as central as possible, preferably near open doorways.' Lastly, make sure its in the center of your house, so you have the best coverage possible throughout your home  Getting free WiFi wherever you are is getting easier by the day. Chances are, your mobile network and internet provider already have deals to give you access to other networks when you're out and about. Many cities, such as San Francisco and New York, are also rolling out free WiFi services in parks and shopping centres. For customers of T-mobile, even flying doesn't stop the free WiFi. The firm offers free in-flight texting, picture messaging, and access to T-Mobile Visual Voicemail on Gogo equipped US airlines.   If you've got a relatively new TV or cable box, the chances are that, as the saying goes: there's an app for that. Many of these make navigating the impenetrable menus of your programme guide far easier - particularly some of the tablet versions of cable TV firm's apps. Chances are, if you have a recent TV or cable box, there's an app for it that could make it far easier to use Some will even act as a second screen, letting you watch TV in bed or even out and about. TV boxes such as Apple TV also have accompanying apps that make entering text and navigating easy. Consoles such as Microsoft's Xbox and Sony's Playstation also have great apps letting you do everything from buy games to access secret maps. The good news is, most of the apps are free - so it's well worth investigating if your home electronics are already WiFi enabled.           While the idea of a smart home where every gadget can talk to each other sounds futuristic (not to mention expensive), you can actually make your home smart right now - and increase your productivity. The key is a simple service called IFTTT, which stands for If This Then That. IFTTT can make your home smart with its simple recipes to control gadgets and online services A basic programming language for everything from Dropbox to smart lightbulbs, it lets you create rules such as 'when I get an email for X then flash my living room light on'. Its very simple to use, and really good fun to play with, to give your home a bit of an intelligence boost.   A surprising number of people don't take advantage of the electronic kit they already own. For instance,  the latest smart TVs and hifis often offer music streaming services such as Spotify for users. Some, such as Sonos, pictured below, offer a vast range of services, letting you listen to everything from Google Music to Deezer at the press of a button - as well as giving you access to radio stations from around the world. Some of the latest hifi kit, such as this Sonos TV speaker, called a PlayBar, can connect via your router to stream songs from services such as Spotify. Often, you can even wirelessly play music from your phone without having to plug in a cable using bluetooth or Apple's AirPlay system.

WashingtonPost.com,http://www.washingtonpost.com/sf/brand-connect/wp/enterprise/helping-farmers-one-acre-at-a-time/,"Until just before he graduated in 2000 with a B.A. in economics and sociology from Northwestern University, Matthew Forti figured his next step in life was a traditional business career—in finance, for example. And for the next four years, it was. He worked as a consultant at Marakon Associates, a management consulting firm, before heading back to Northwestern to get his MBA at the Kellogg School of Management in 2004. But then his friend, Andrew Youn, had an idea. Youn had traveled to Kenya and met two farmers: one successful and one not. He realized that the difference between the women’s fortunes was quite basic: seed, fertilizer, and training. And thus, in collaboration with Forti,One Acre Fundwas created. It was an appropriate time. By the early 2000s, social entrepreneurship – the idea that business principles could be applied to major social problems – had really taken hold. One Acre Fund enables farmers in Kenya, Rwanda, Burundi, and Tanzania (with additional small pilots in Uganda and Malawi) to increase their crop yields as a way to escape hunger and poverty. “I got really excited,” he said. “I could use those business skills to do good in the world.” Sub-Saharan nations have arid land, making it difficult to grow crops. One Acre Fund provides the farmers with higher quality seed and fertilizer than they’d otherwise have access to, as well as training for composting, harvesting, and seeding. Then, once the crops were grown, One Acre Fund helped the farmers profit from them. The ramifications are enormous, as 70 percent of the world’s poor are farmers, according to Forti. “So if you can make farmers more productive, it’s a big leverage point in the fight against global poverty,” he said. The farmers’ increased profits can be used for housing, health, and education for their children. And that, said Forti, “is why we exist.” For Forti and the Fund, the proverb “Give a man a fish and you’ll feed him for a day. Teach a man to fish and you’ll feed him for a lifetime” is reality. Kindness is more than being polite. It’s lifting others up in ways like the fund does. Crucially, One Acre Fund doesn’t give cash loans. Instead, they’re loaning the farmer the seeds, the fertilizer, and other products. This ensures that “the microfinance is actually being put into the ground.” By treating the farmers as customers and clients, rather than charity cases, the Fund gives them value and dignity. By March 2006, One Acre Fund had begun a pilot program with 40 farmers in Kenya, who received seed, fertilizer, and training on credit. By the end of 2007, One Acre Fund had a staff of 60 and had partnered with 600 farmers. It was a success. Today, Forti said, there are about 3,200 staffers: 3,000 African staff and about 200 expatriate staff. Forti, One Acre Fund’s first board chairman, had taken a slight detour after graduation, during which he picked up considerable nonprofit experience. He’d been a manager at the Bridgespan Group, a 501(c)3. Forti is an outlier, as most people who go for their MBA don’t opt to go the nonprofit route. But in 2013, Forti joined One Acre Fund as managing director, after serving as a volunteer for the organization since 2006. His work varies by the day. Sometimes he’s coordinating supporting functions to make sure One Acre Fund’s fields program has the resources it needs to flourish. Other days, he’s running the organization’s board here in the U.S. or attending a conference, speaking about the work and mission, and to develop partnerships with financial supporters. Forti, unlike most of the staff, lives in the United States; 99 percent of the staff lives in Africa (We have 25 in the U.S. out of 3200). This, he says, is a significant reason for the success of the program: staffers live in the communities where they work, often as close as 200 meters from a farmer. “We don’t parachute into a community, do some interviews, then leave,” he said. One Acre Fund currently works with 280,000 farm families, with a goal of reaching a million annually by 2020. For Forti, the work is personal: “What’s so inspiring about farmers is they’re doing backbreaking labor, 10-plus hours a day. They’re living in horrible conditions, and they’re food insecure for several months of the year. They can’t even grow enough to feed their children. And yet these farmers are so optimistic.” “They believe in a better future,” he said. “They want to create a better life for their children.”"

When it comes to the milk America drinks, cows shouldn't get all the credit. Dairy farmers like Dave and Laurie Kyle of Elkhorn, Wis., put in just as much hard work as their bovine counterparts. Morning for these dairy producers starts early. By 4:30, the Kyles and their farmhands are up for the first of two rounds of milking their 110 registered Holstein cows. While the cows are in the milking parlor, Dave is busy cleaning the barn, replenishing bedding and filling watering units with fresh water. Next, it's time to feed the girls a nutritious breakfast of farm-grown hay, corn and silage (a high-moisture feed that is often made from grass crops that provides many of the nutrients present in plants) mixed with soybean meal and Milwaukee malted rye. (During the warmer months, the cows also graze on fresh pasture.) Dave meets with a local nutritionist weekly, and feed blends are customized to meet each cow's current dietary needs, based on her weight and milk production level. Afternoons are more varied, yet still just as busy. In the summer, it's often the time to hop on the tractor and harvest feed crops. When the Kyles aren't harvesting, they'll often tend to other tasks, such as any variety of farm-related repairs. ""When you're a farmer, you have to be good at being an electrician, plumber and mechanic, because you can't really afford to pay outside vendors,"" Laurie admits. There's also checking in with veterinarians and testing milk for quality and safety. This includes testing for antibiotic residues — a process that takes place up to eight times before the milk is sent to the local processing plant. Setting aside time each day to simply observe the cows' behavior is also essential to ensure that they're healthy. On some days, the Kyles give farm tours, too. ""It's cool to see kids' faces light up when they pet the calves that were born a week ago, because most families don't know where their food comes from,"" says Laurie. While Dave spends much of his day on the farm, Laurie, a nutrition educator, can usually be found at Perkup Elkhorn, the coffee shop she opened in 2012 to forge deeper community connections and earn additional income. ""Because I'm passionate about agriculture and healthy eating, it seemed like a perfect fit. The message that I have is that American agriculture is alive and well, and farmers are still some of the most trustworthy individuals that are providing wholesome products for all,"" she says. When she isn't chatting with customers about milk's vast nutritional benefits, she's tackling bookwork for the farm in the back office. Dave might stop in for a bit to discuss bills, but it's back to the farm by 4:30 p.m. for the day's second round of milking, cleaning and feeding. After working as long as 17 hours, he finally arrives back home. Like most families, long days and busy schedules—including working around 16-year-old daughter Mackenzie’s travel softball games and practices and 20-year-old son Hayden’s college course load—mean the Kyles don't get to eat dinner together as often as they might like. But it's a small sacrifice to make in exchange for a truly rewarding outcome. ""Knowing you're producing wholesome products for people and doing it by rolling up your sleeves and working hard, there's a real pride involved in that,"" says Laurie. "
WashingtonPost.com,http://www.washingtonpost.com/sf/brand-connect/past-sins-present-dangers/,"Content Created by WP BrandStudio While the storied Italian Mafia has lost its stronghold in the United States, its progeny remain alive and active with an estimated 3,000 members and affiliates. The FBI still calls La Cosa Nostra “the foremost organized criminal threat to American society.” Yet organized crime networks have shifted dramatically since the Mafia’s heyday. Major crime families are replaced by an intricate web of foreign nationalities that engage in everything from wire fraud to computer hacking and human trafficking. And although the FBI’s siloed response evolved to a broader interagency cooperation, numerous syndicates snake under the radar and give law enforcement a headache. Today, “the loyalties are gone. There used to be big bosses, under-bosses and soldiers. It is a much younger crowd now with smaller cells, and everybody turns on each other,” said Eric Schneider, a former associate of kingpin Whitey Bulger and Boston’s Irish mob. “The ongoing attraction to organized crime is still probably a byproduct of the past two decades of people growing up with ‘Goodfellas’ and aspiring to that life, which I don’t understand now.” Real-life and fictional gangsters continue to resonate powerfully in film and television – from Bulger biopic “Black Mass” to “American Hustle” to Esquire Network’s upcoming scripted drama series “Spotless.” Schneider worked with Bulger from 1986 until 1993 when he was arrested. To avoid a life sentence, Schneider testified against his partners. “I went against what I was brought up with – the code of silence – you kept your mouth closed.” His partners went to prison and he spent 20 years in witness protection. He recently revealed his identity in his book ""The Choir Boy."" While in decades past the FBI chased Italian and Irish mobsters, it now pursues criminals of multiple nationalities, including those who target U.S. citizens online from abroad. Since many crimes now happen online, the FBI heavily recruits tech experts and cybersecurity agents for electronic surveillance. The laundry list of organized crime in the United States is ever-growing. Adding to the traditional racketeering activities of old are drug and human trafficking, tax fraud, hacking, identity theft, securities and investment fraud, sale of untaxed merchandise and counterfeit goods, and fraudulent mortgages, insurance, credit cards, food stamps and baby formula. Groups often cooperate across ethnic and racial heritage lines, and co-mingle their illegal activities with legitimate business ventures. They’ve been identified in more than 50 metropolitan areas in the United States. Much U.S.-based organized crime has roots in families, tribes or clans in originating countries. These structures strengthen networks and perpetuate the cycle of crime. In response, the FBI dedicates its organized crime units to different ethnic and geographic categories – Italian, Asian, African, Eurasian and Middle Eastern. The FBI lacks undercover agents who speak the native language of communities and can infiltrate them without suspicion. “We don’t have enough agents who speak the languages fluently,” said Anthony Brizzolara, a retired special agent and 32-year FBI veteran. “We rely more on physical and electronic surveillance. The good news is that the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organization federal law of 1970 (RICO) has allowed agencies to significantly gut entrenched networks like the Italian and Irish by prosecuting syndicate leaders for crimes they commissioned. With RICO, law enforcement can attack an entire entity instead of imprisoning individuals, who can easily be replaced with other associates. “RICO all but destroyed traditional organized crime in America,” said Robert Lombardo, associate professor of criminology and criminal justice at Loyola University in Chicago. “The law gave us a lot more power and ability to affect change and eventually get people to roll over,” Brizzolara said. “Once the dam broke as higher level folks ‘turned,’ over time more turned, which helped turn the tide for us against [the Italian Mafia].” Yet new opportunists are always looking for ways to skirt laws. Brizzolara noted that illegal immigrants who enter through Canada and Mexico from around the world continually feed existing criminal networks. “The common denominator is that a lot of money is being funneled back to home countries, with entire families involved” in both public nuisance crimes and violent crimes like drug and human trafficking. “The FBI and other agencies target these groups and make arrests, and often the major players get deported. Six months later, they show up on surveillance. They are adept at getting back into the country,” said Dennis Franks, former FBI special agent and managing director at Risk Control Strategies in Houston. Just last year, federal, state and local officials staged a major money laundering takedown of the Sinaloa drug cartel in Los Angeles. “Mexican drug cartels are the most important organized crime challenge that we face. The DEA are the unsung heroes in the effort against the cartels,” Lombardo said. Interagency alliances against organized crime began to appear after the passage of RICO and have flourished in the post-9/11 era. “I like to think it’s changed a lot since I became an agent 32 years ago. It’s 100 times better in terms of sharing and working with other agencies. It’s better to work together and not stovepipe things,” Brizzolara said. Now that Bulger is in prison and the Boston Irish mob appears a distant memory, American groups without native ties overseas are more concentrated in home-grown hate or terrorist cells that work for political or social purposes, Brizzolara said. Although, “our prison system is a wonderful breeding ground for getting folks together who are incarcerated and of like minds to coalesce.” And that is true for criminals of any background. Whether it’s cartels, La Cosa Nostra or any insidious operation, loyalties do not always prevent groups from forming outside alliances. For example, Colombian and Mexican cartels have collaborated to smuggle cocaine to the United States. “While they might fight with each other within their country or their organizations, they become quite adept at being able to collaborate with other criminal groups,” Franks said. “Any groups can learn to adapt if it makes sense business wise.” Watch how organized crime comes between two brothers on “Spotless,” premiering Nov. 14 on Esquire Network."
BusinessInsider.com,http://www.businessinsider.com/sc/real-estate-smart-business-move-2015-12,"iStockIn the world of modern business, where you are is just as important as what you do. The right location plays a big part in attracting qualified talent, allowing more collaboration, and presenting a relatable, physical association for customers and clients.Today, real estate is not necessarily seen as a source of competitive advantage – but it very much is.It's actually a tool that can drive business. Skilled real estate management is a discipline; lack of experience can have serious consequences. Both new and established companies are susceptible to bad real estate decisions without realizing the implications they can have on the business — or the value a good real estate move can offer. Here's how one company has used real estate as a successful business strategy. Young & Rubicam is one of the most recognized and respected ad agencies in the world. But a few years ago Y&R was going through changes.For more than 86 years, the agency’s global headquarters were at 285 Madison Avenue in New York City, and the space was synonymous with the agency itself. However, as Y&R continued to expand, its space on Madison avenue no longer provided the amenities it needed. Finding the right space was critical for Y&R; not only did it have to meet its expanding needs, it also had to be a space where the agency's culture, ethos, and creativity could thrive. Working withCBRE, a commercial real estate services firm, Y&Ridentified 3 Columbus Circle as the ideal site for its new global headquarters. CBRE helped Y&R secure ahybrid deal to acquire a condominium interest of floors three through eight, and enter into a 20-year lease for floors nine, 10, 18, and 19 at 3 Columbus Circle. Y&R's new offices allow for creative expression and better collaboration.CBREOne of the many draws of the new building is that it provides a number of features that are appealing to both employees and clients, including a sunlit mix of public and private space. Different pieces of art on the walls match the creativity of the campaigns that come from the agency teams. Recognizing that the office is where many employees spend most of their time, Y&R created a number of break areas: a roof deck where people can enjoy stunning views of Central Park; a cafeteria that offers a number of different dining options; and areas for employees to relax and even play foosball and shuffleboard. And it's not just the actual building that can influence employees' happiness — the location is also a big draw. The neighborhood has easy subway access, so it's convenient for employees from across the numerous New York City boroughs. Because the office is part of a hub that houses other agencies within WPP (Y&R's holding company), it creates a great space for Y&R to collaborate with colleagues at sister firms. The space has proven to be a valuable asset for Y&R, helping the firm deliver on its best-in-class creative reputation and serve as a place where both employees and clients want to be. Another reminder that it’s not just about what you do, but where you do it. Find out more about Y&R’s story and how the right real estate can help your business. This post is sponsored byCBRE."

EliteDaily.com,http://elitedaily.com/life/culture/dining-out-best-way-explore-your-city/1330807/?ref=brandtale.com,"Iâm in my fifth year of living in New York City, and I know I still havenât taken advantage of everything the city has to offer. I havenât explored the reaches of all five boroughs. I havenât seen all the landmarks. I havenât soaked up all the culture there is to soak. Yet my boyfriend is a born-and-bred NYC local, and while I would have thought that heâs been everywhere there is to go. In reality, Iâve actually shown him some spots that he had never visited before. Itâs almost impossible to be an expert on your home city. There are so many different neighborhoods; new, must-visit locations open every day. Every local you talk to has a different set of favorite places. It can be totally overwhelming. But if you really want to get to know your urban home, thereâs one foolproof way to do it: dining out. Nothing beats the authenticity of a local restaurant. Here are six reasons dining out is the best way to explore your city: In the winter months, we look out the window, and all we can do is sigh. Itâs gloomy and cold â two adjectives that are screaming, âStay home!â Weâre inclined to keep to our little bubbles and not venture out of our neighborhoods for anything beyond work. A good restaurant recommendation can change all of that, though. If you hear that thereâs great paella on the other side of town, your taste buds NEED to trek there. If your best friend is stoked about the curry in a different borough, you HAVE to try it. We will travel anywhere for a good meal. And in the process, weâre walking through new neighborhoods we wouldnât otherwise see. It could inspire us to find a new favorite street, or even move to a new area. There are certain haunts in every city that each generation of inhabitants has visited. If you ask your grandmother where to go, she might tell you to try the old Italian place with the 100-year-old Ragu recipe. Talk to your parents, and theyâll send you to the burger place that opened in the 1950s. Hitting up these restaurants is the best way to connect to older generations, in and out of your family. It also makes you a part of the fabric of your metropolis. When you cook for yourself, you cook what you know. If you were raised on spaghetti and meatballs, thatâs the recipe youâre using at the end of the day. The beauty of eating out is trying the different cultures your city houses. Mediterranean, Indian, Hawaiian, Ethiopian â itâs all there for the tasting. Itâs the most delicious way to expand your horizons. Restaurants are the city equivalent of a safari watering hole. Different types of characters come out at night, seeking sustenance. You see them all when youâre eating out. People-watching is basically a sport when you live in a city. You look around and ascribe fictional backgrounds to the eclectic mix of people you see. Itâs a free dose of fun served up with your meal. There is no better feeling than walking into a restaurant or coffee shop and the staff greeting you with open arms. If they know your name, thatâs a plus. If they know your order, thatâs a major plus. Being a regular connects to your community. You know not only the staff, but also the other regulars. You start seeing them around the neighborhood as you run errands, and you give each other a nod. Knowing how the other takes theirÂ coffee has bonded you. Letâs be honest: In your life, youâre basically just filling time in between meals. You are stoked when someone suggests it might be time to eat. So when you eat out, itâs a chance to merge your insatiable hunger with a social activity. Why play a round of mini-golf with friends when you can all break bread together? Especially if you get a good deal on a prix fixe meal. You and your friends will never regret a night out on the town with a good meal. Itâs the best way to fulfill your need to be cultured and fed."
EliteDaily.com,http://elitedaily.com/dating/thoughts-netflix-chill/1265419/?ref=brandtale.com,"Nothing is more exhilarating than meeting a new crush. You're having a totally normal night at your friend's party when theÂ guy from across the room comes over to chat you up. You find out, shockingly, you have quite a bit in common. After you exchange numbers, you reside in the warm habitat of possibility. He hasn't screwed anything up yet or burst your expectations. Your ignorance to what your future with him may hold is bliss. Once he finally texts a few days later, you're stoked. You told your friends you didn't expect to hear from him again after your short makeout sesh, but, obviously, you were lying. You start thinking about all of the speakeasies you've been to in the past few months and mentally cataloged for first dates. Then, he drops aÂ bomb you should have seen coming:ÂâHow about we stay in and watch a movie?â He essentially just asked you to ""Netflix and chill."" Cue the whirlwind of thoughts that start circlingÂ through your mind."
EliteDaily.com,http://elitedaily.com/music/exit-reality-enter-tomorrowworld/1263096/?ref=brandtale.com,"When my boss told me I was being sent to Chattahoochee Hills, Georgia to cover TomorrowWorld 2015, my brain couldnât work fast enough to give any response other than, âMe? Really?â Electronic dance music is one of those genres of music with a reputation. Everyone has an image in their heads of the prototypical EDM festival-goers: theyâre in their early-to-mid twenties, wearing neon and flower crowns, dancing with no abandon. Thatâs not exactly me. Iâm more acoustic guitar, less bass drop. To the point where, in telling my friends that I was covering the biggest EDM festival in the US, I got the same reaction across the board: âYou? Really?â Armed with that arsenal of glowing support, I hopped in a cab to JFK Airport absolutely terrified that I was going to stick out like a sore thumb in the TomorrowWorld crowd. Was I going to look like a narc? I immediately regretted not hitting up the craft store to fashion my very own flower crown. The nerves kept bubbling up throughout the flight to Georgia, and in the car with the Elite Daily crew as we drove out to the festival. The city scape of Atlanta transformed into farmland in the blink of an eye. I had read that TomorrowWorld USA takes place in a magical forest location, but I didnât realize that was the first step in a total break from reality."

BBC,http://www.bbc.com/sport/move-like-never-before/34716617?ref=brandtale.com," Partnered content Presented by Mazda This is the first article in a four-part special advertising feature series presented by Mazda that looks at the ongoing relationship between technology, innovation and sport. Technical innovation in sport - it's something we as participants and fans take for granted now. It could be Grand Prix champion Lewis Hamilton talking to his pit crew throughout his thrilling drive in Austin Texas to win the 2015 Formula One title. Or improvements in the safety standards of cricketers' helmets, following the death of Australian Test batsman Phillip Hughes when a delivery struck him at the top of his neck, in Sydney in 2014. Perhaps the most interesting development is the introduction of ingestible computers that constantly transmit data on a player's vital functions, such as blood pressure and body temperature. Athletes in sports as diverse as motor sport, athletics, football and hockey are already using them. It's the latest innovation in the ever-changing world of sports technology. If you look at the many incredible achievements of the modern world, chances are you'll find it's a result of a potent combination of innovation and technology. This combination lets us live and move like never before. Mazda's innovation and technology has allowed them to develop the Mazda CX-3. Let's turn the clock back more than 70 years, when one of sport's greatest innovations evolved from a bitter feud between two brothers.  Adi and Rudi Dassler were partners in a sports shoe company in Herzogenaurach, Germany. After  an acrimonious split , the brothers formed rival companies - Adidas and Puma - on opposite sides of the river Aurach. The schism inspired a battle for domination in athletic footwear - firstly in newly formed West Germany, and then the rest of the world. It led to a race to find styles and materials that gave top athletes the slightest advantage. Manufacturers  are still in a fight for domination, with the global market tipped to be worth US$84.4 billion in 2018. Amazingly, Adidas and Puma are still up there fighting for their share of the lucrative sports shoe market, along with Nike, Reebok and other companies. The only objective is to win - to be bigger, stronger, faster … smarter. Athletes, teams and sports organisations will always seek to find an edge over their rivals (or the stopwatch). It might be the chance to gain a physical advantage through better training techniques, or a mental edge through superior tactics. Or it might be through playing with equipment that allows them to go faster, with more comfort and safety, for longer. At the 2015 Tour de France, for example, cyclists carried miniature GPS-equipped computers that tracked speed, distance travelled and calories burned. Technology continues to be crucial factor in any individual or team success, especially at the elite level. And as every player or team finds an advantage, opponents try to counter it. This sports innovation cycle  has made billionaires of entrepreneurs in the sports equipment industry, and created jobs for sports scientists and psychologists who deliver stunning results for athletes, teams and sponsors. The push for sporting innovation has also given spectators the chance to be more involved in the action.  Using miniature, high-speed and even infrared cameras and ultra-sensitive microphones, broadcasters and sports organisations bring fans closer to the action. Intimacy equals greater ratings and sponsorship money. When Tennis legend John McEnroe screamed 'You Cannot Be Serious' at the Umpire while contesting a decision, it added to the excitement for the Wimbledon crowd. With the introduction of Hawk-Eye in Grand Slams in 2006, we may have lost some of the human drama, but we've gained a near-faultless ball-tracking technology that enjoys the support  of most players and officials. Many sporting organisations,  including  the NFL in the US, and the Rugby Union authorities at the recent World Cup in England, use ""slo-mo"" video technology as part of their on-field decision-making, while their officials  use it to determine if players should be suspended for foul play. Technology has also had  a fundamental impact on the way players train. Cutting-edge training facilities are a home away from home for elite athletes, who rely on sophisticated machines and monitors to reach peak performance while averting the risk of injury. Sports scientists use technology to develop training regimes that allow individual athletes to perform at their best. Modern technology also allows sports to find future stars, with talented teenagers tested to determine which disciplines best suit their physiology. These days, star rowers are discovered before they even step onto a boat. But some sports testing is less about finding champions and more about exposing cheats. World anti-drug agencies strive - with varying degrees of success - to develop sophisticated tests to uncover athletes and coaches who are seeking an unfair chemical advantage. Technology has also revolutionised sports psychology. What gives players confidence, awareness, courage? How do players stop being complacent, fearful, nervous? Psychologists have learnt the answer is different for every athlete. Visualisation techniques, where players ""see"" a successful outcome before it happens, are practised by athletes at all levels. Managers and coaches increasingly use technology to help with tactics, in real time. In cricket, ball-tracking software helps bowlers find weaknesses in batting techniques. And in Australian Rules Football, live statistics help coaches find players who are getting beaten by their opponents. Motor sport is an industry almost entirely based on technology.  Grand Prix racing takes this to the furthest reaches, with competitors looking for any edge that will bring them faster  lap times measurable to one-thousandth of a second. Engine and chassis information is available in real time for drivers, team managers and  pit crews. This information is available to fans watching on television or on their computers or mobile devices. Consumers are the ultimate winners when innovations trickle down from elite competition. Motor sport has improved the efficiency and safety of road cars, and continues to be a test bed for technology. In the same way that disc brakes, advanced four-wheel drive systems and turbochargers were developed in the motor-sport crucible decades ago, the world's smartest engineers are refining hybrid engine technology, synthetic oils and fuels  to improve the cars we will drive in the future. This principle applies in all sports. The same state-of-the-art composite racquet Novak Djokovic used to win Wimbledon will win the mixed doubles final at the local tennis club. Golf equipment manufacturers, forced to abide by a strict set of global rules for elite and amateur players, endeavour to design clubs that help hackers hit the ball straighter and longer. What of the future?  Some say we're entering the age of 'smart wearables' technology, with athletes competing in outfits that transmit performance data in real time. Others believe  that nanotechnology will transform the way everyday sporting equipment is made, making it  stronger, lighter and easier to use. Hopefully, we will continue to be the beneficiaries of these advances, both as amateur competitors whose clothing and equipment are constantly improving, and as armchair fans whose enjoyment of sport is given a boost by the latest revolutionary technological advance.

NYDailyNews.com,http://www.nydailynews.com/services/gift-guide/mall-fresh-air-last-minute-s-article-1.2459771,"Sponsored Content Provided by Westbury Market Fair Want to shop the tables of up to 100 vendors — selling items at up to 75% off retail? Then head to theWestbury Market Fairfor an efficient and cost-effective way to finish up that last-minute shopping. Started in March 2015 by two flea market veterans, ""Gorilla Dave"" and Dave ""With Groceries"" Algarin, the Westbury Market Fair offers a diverse, enjoyable outdoor shopping option. The culmination of years of being vendors, the two Daves wanted to continue the rich history of such flea markets past as Roosevelt Field, Aqueduct and Valley Stream. They recognized the need for vendors looking for a venue and a community looking for an old-fashioned shopping experience. We spoke with Brian Baxter, Westbury Market Fair field and marketing manager, on how the fair can help those looking for the perfect last-minute gifts. When and where does the fair take place? It's open every Saturday and Sunday from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. inthe parking lot of the NYCB Theater at 960 Brush Hollow Road in Westbury, New York. It's a great location that's easy to get to and is well known. People have been coming to the theater for 50 years, so they know it and are comfortable getting here. It's easily accessible by car or by LIRR. It's in the heart of Westbury, so if you live in Queens, Staten Island, Westchester, Nassau County or the Brooklyn area, it's easy to get to. How many and what types of vendors do you have? We have 100 on Saturdays and around 80 on Sundays. They offer a little bit of everything, and we aim to be a one-stop shop. You'll find antiques and collectibles, shoes for men, women and kids, both new and used clothing, health and beauty items, groceries. Plus, we have an ""As Seen on TV"" section and garage sale spaces, as well as tools, sporting goods, equipment and lots of home-made costume jewelry. Why is the perfect place to shop for gifts? You can come down and do all the holiday shopping in one spot and get tremendous bargains, usually 75% off most major retailers. If you come and browse the tables you'll find both new and used items, rare and unique pieces you won't find in your local department store. What are the perks of an outdoor shopping experience? For a lot of people, the whole Black Friday mall situation was intimidating and scary. There are just too many people in a confined area. Our fair is all outdoors, so it's comfortable and provides a nice change of pace. For people who want to take a break from shopping are there places to eat and drink? Yes! We like to say we have food from all nations, including a taco place, a soul food truck and sausage trucks. Plus, we have bathrooms and places to sit, so it's an enjoyable way to spend an afternoon. For more information about visiting the fair and vendor opportunities, call (516) 630-3739 or visitwww.westburymarketfair.com."

NYPost.com,http://nypost.com/dispatch/heres-your-perfect-itinerary-for-a-long-weekend-in-daytona-beach/?ref=brandtale.com,"Dispatch November 12, 2015 | 1:00pm Sponsored by: The classic seaside town of Daytona Beach has an iconic vibe, a longstanding motorsports heritage, and a surprising array of new offerings. But beyond its miles of sparkling beaches and NASCAR epicenter are glories like new cultural museums, accommodations, parks, attractions and more. And sinceJetBlue is adding daily nonstop service from JFK to Daytona Beachstarting January 7, 2016, now’s the perfect time to plan a dreamy long weekend. Accommodations span a large spectrum on Daytona Beach — from rustic campgrounds and casual one-of-a-kind motels to popular chain motels and luxury vacation suites. If you’re drawn to the perks of a luxury beach hotel (saltwater pool, spa, kid’s amenities), check intoThe Shores Resort & Spa, a 4-diamond property on the beach. Each of the 212 rooms has a view of the ocean, the beach, or the Intracoastal. There’s plenty of Floridian charm to be had in charming nearby New Smyrna Beach, particularly at theBlack Dolphin Inn, a 14-room Spanish-Isle charmer crafted with old Florida wood and filled with mid-century decor. Top off your morning coffee with a locally sourced breakfast in the sunny dining nook before heading off for a back-country fishing excursion withBlackFly on the Indian Riverin Mosquito Lagoon. When cold beers and fish tacos call, head toThe Taco Shack, a locally owned and operated surf-themed taqueria where booths and burritos are in high demand. Driving is permitted on specified areas of the hard-packed sandy beaches of Daytona Beach and New Smyrna Beach — a rarity in Florida. Pay the ten-dollar permit fee (with a maximum speed of 10 mph, windows down, lights on and no texting, please,) and take in the ocean breeze. If you’re toting kids, take them to meet the locals (turtles, stingrays, manatees) at theMarine Science Center. Or hit upThree Brothers Paddleboardsfor SUP jaunts on the backwater estuaries on beautifully handcrafted woodies inspired by the classic surfboards of the 1950s and ‘60s. All that sun and sand can build up an appetite. Big bowls of mussels and cioppino are calling from a table under the arbor atThe Garlic, a kitschy Italian joint where meatballs are called bocce balls (and are about the same size). Along with 23 miles of white sand beaches you’ll find a striking, iconic watermark: the historicPonce de Leon Inlet lighthouse. If your travel schedule and the lunar calendar align for Climb to the Moon, you’ll be treated to sparkling beverages, light bites, and a panorama of the coast under the light of a full moon. Workout the arms and calm the mind with a morning kayaking adventure on the Tomoka River. While there, soak up the history of local Native American tribes atTomoka State Park. Fill up on good coffee, omelettes and apple fritters like the locals do at the upbeatCracked Egg Diner. The sunny breakfast outpost is run by two brothers who make customers – and tasty foods – a priority. For a look at Florida interpreted on canvas, swing by theCici & Hyatt Brown Museum of Art, new to the Smithsonian-affiliatedMuseum of Arts and Sciences. The Brown Museum houses the largest collection of Florida-themed watercolors and oil paintings (dating back to 1839). Indulge your inner carb-lover atDonnie’s Donuts, a modern doughnut shop with organic, tricked-out treats that are fried to perfection and served with fair trade coffee. Kick back at the beach then knock a few back during happy hour atThe Joint, a craft beer bar and lounge — and one of the first stops on the Daytona Beach Ale Trail that includes stops atOrmond Brewing Company,Tomoka Brewery,Seabreeze Taphouse,Odd Elixir Meads, and other local favorites. Just make sure you have a designated driver for the night. Just outside Downtown DeLand in DeLeon Springs State Park you’ll find the oh-so-popularOld Spanish Mill Restaurant, where diners can cook pancakes right at their table. Explore the miles of trails on-site, and see manatees, alligators, and an amazing variety of birds. For a brisk round of golf, the area provides more than 20 opportunities to hone your skills.LPGA Internationaloffers two 18-hole championship courses, and nearbyVictoria Hillshas rolling hills, sand obstacles, and pine tree-lined fairways that look more like the Carolinas than the Floridian-style courses. TheGolf Club at Cypress HeadandDaytona Beach Golf Clubare both excellent public golf courses, and definitely a good bang (and challenge) for the buck. Before catching your flight, make a pitstop atHull’s Seafood, a wholesale and to-go shop with daily lunch specials, fish platters, soups, salads, and steamed shellfish. Finish off with a hushpuppy and slice of Floridian key lime pie. Share Selection © 2020 NYP Holdings, Inc.

NYPost.com,http://nypost.com/dispatch/power-and-drugs-collide-behind-the-velvet-rope-in-new-york-city/?ref=brandtale.com,"Dispatch June 2, 2014 | 8:00am Sponsored by: Every 10 years or so, you hear the phrase, “New York is dead!” People are always looking to declare that the Big Apple has lost its bite. However, that’s just not true. “Power,” the upcoming NYC-based drama from Starz, tells a Gotham tale full of intrigue — both uptown and downtown. In every neighborhood of New York City, salacious and scandalous possibilities abound in ordinary bars and fancy clubs alike. Check out The Power Playlist on Spotify, exclusively for “Power.”  Patrons escape their daily lives and slip into a parallel universe that can often straddle the line between ritzy glamour and the harsh realities of drugs. We went out to uncover some of these stories from behind the velvet rope, as told by bartenders, club owners and DJs, the ones who have truly seen it all. A longtime bar owner in Manhattan’s East Village describes an average night as: “A few people — musicians, artists — nodding off on heroin while a coke dealer had sex for a bag in the bathroom. In another corner, the local Bloods factions could be chopping it up with the vice detectives. Neither side giving intel. It’s that mix of downtown models, murderers, criminals, ad execs, editors and cops that kept the peace. You need that in a good New York bar.” Meanwhile, the co-owner of a lounge on Williamsburg’s trendy South Side witnesses equally intriguing characters: “One a busy Friday night, a tall Latino guy walks into my place alone. He’s wearing a three-piece, lime green suit — matching hat, green shoes and tie. I ask him if he wants a table, he says he just wants a drink at the bar, so I show him to a seat. He asks if we have Bacardi Rum; I explain we don’t. He steps back and says proudly, ‘Tonight is my niece’s quinceañera, that’s why I dress like this. But you know I like to look good for the ladies.’ He continues: ‘But not everyone is into the ladies, you know? My son? He’s a transsexual! He wants to be a girl!’ He looks me hard in the eye. ‘But I don’t care!’ He slaps me on the arm. ‘We all gotta do what’s right for us. I don’t have no problem with doin’ what you gotta do.’ At this point, I’m just trying to figure out how crazy this guy really is. ‘When I was on the inside,’ he says, ‘I used to do what I had to do. And now, you have to pay if you want to be with me. A thousand dollars sometimes.’ Then he puts his hand on my shoulder and says, ‘But you seem like a good guy. I’ll only charge you 200.’ I told him to get the hell out of my bar.” And, of course, there’s the music scene. An in-demand DJ saw an inexperienced band make a bit of a party faux pas: “I was working a show at a Brooklyn venue. Some of these guys in the band were supposed to take the stage and were stalling. We went backstage to tell them to get on and they were doing lines of coke off a drum. They were all like, ‘Yeah, yeah, hold on, let me finish these lines fist’ — trying to be cool in front of the busted girls that were surrounding them. I wanted to tell them that every drummer who has ever played at this venue has used drum as part of the house kit; every drummer has sweat and bled on that drum. But I didn’t. Those guys probably got all sorts of nasty s— up their nose.” It’s not all grit and grime, though.  Another DJ told us that he’s had to fight off rich Young Turks looking to turn him into a human jukebox:“I was DJing at a club one night and this guy comes up to me and tells me that he’ll give me $1,000 if I put on ‘Wrecking Ball’ by Miley Cyrus immediately. I told him no. And I still feel good about it.” Share Selection © 2020 NYP Holdings, Inc.

NYPost.com,http://nypost.com/dispatch/6-hidden-benefits-of-an-online-education/?ref=brandtale.com,"Dispatch August 10, 2015 | 4:00pm Sponsored by: Swipe right if you’re excited about the state of online education. You should be, because it seems the technology is finally catching up with the promise of delivering a bonafide college degree entirely online. Make no mistake, though: The path to your degree may be more convenient, but the work is just as rigorous.At the CUNY School of Professional Studies– which is ranked #3 in New York State and #27 in the nation inUS News & World Report’s 2015 Best Online Bachelor’s Degree Programs list – there is no difference in workload or pedigree when it comes to earning a degree online or off. And for all the obvious benefits like accessibility and affordability, dig deeper and you’ll find a trove of hidden benefits, too. Here are six to keep in mind when deciding if an online education is right for you. Recent census data showed that 71% of undergraduates in the U.S. were working during school. And the value of a degree is undisputed: those with a bachelor’s degree earn approximately $57,026 per year, compared to the $34,197 for those with only a high school diploma. Online school lets students get the degree they need to advance their career without having to miss work to get there. The average college student buys 6 textbooks per semester. One tree can yield enough paper to make roughly 35 textbooks. With online students using less hard copy text books and less paper in class, that amounts to a whole lot of salvaged trees each year. Studies show that having more control over the pace and environment of your learning can have very positive effects. For example, your ability to retain information diminishes after 25-30 minutes. And something as simple as changing scenery improves retention when studying. So the freedom to study when and where you want isn’t just convenient – it’s a grade booster. In New York City, the average commute time is 37.8 minutes. That means that during a 32-week school year, a student could spend 200 hours (or 8.4 days) commuting to and from school – time that could be better spent with family and friends. Though the freshman “15” may overstate the issue, a recent study of college freshmen tracked an average gain of approximately 0.3 pounds per week – 11 times more than the typical weekly weight gain in 17- and 18-year-olds and 20 times more than the typical American adult. The culprits: stress from change of environment, all-you-can-eat cafeteria buffets, and lack of sleep – all things you won’t have to worry about in your home environment. Daily consumer spending, or “walking around money” spent, is near all-time highs at over $90 per day. That includes stores, restaurants, gas stations, and other living expenses. In other words: Having to trek around town is expensive. Being able to attend class from wherever you want? Much more economical. Share Selection © 2020 NYP Holdings, Inc.

Mashable.com,http://mashable.com/2016/01/27/financial-tech-brandspeak/#MuhiTlDTR8qJ,"The ways we make purchases and conduct our financial business are changing every day and will continue to change perpetually as technology evolves. To better understand some of the top fintech trends ahead, we sat down with Il Sun Yoo, director of data engineering at Capital One — a company long known for its data-driven pioneering moves in financial services. ""At Capital One, we are focused on reimagining banking,"" says Il Sun Yoo, Capital One's director of data engineering. ""We are innovating in a range of ways, incorporating design thinking for an empathetic customer-driven focus, leveraging big data to generate customer insights, and embracing the cloud to deliver digital products to market faster.""  As for what fintech trends are hot right now, Yoo referenced a recent survey that Capital One conducted at Money20/20, the world's leading payments and financial services innovation event. The survey included responses from executives in payments and financial services, investments, analysts, media, government and consulting services, as well as mobile, retail integrated commerce and marketing services. Among the key findings: If you're not already using your fingerprint to access devices or for security measures, you're likely to be doing so pretty soon. This makes sense, since every person's fingerprint is completely unique and nearly impossible to duplicate. Cash used to be king, but as technology makes paperless billing more prevalent and convenient, you can expect to have more paperless payment options — and you can expect to make fewer trips to the ATM. The ways we can gather and analyze big data are constantly improving and becoming more robust. ""Capital One has always been a data-driven company, so it was natural for Capital One to embrace big data technologies for application in the consumer banking space,"" says Yoo. Yoo says that technology and automation are decreasing friction and cost, which means financial services can become ""more and more democratized."" ""The ability to crunch more data, faster, will lead to improved financial health,"" he says. While relatively new, shopping via social media could quickly grow in popularity. In fact, 22% of those surveyed believe that by 2030, nearly half of holiday sales transactions will be completed via social media shopping. The following infographic has more information on the survey findings.  As the world of finance and banking continues to evolve, so does the culture and workspaces of companies in the financial industry. Yoo works out of Capital One's New York City technology center at 114 5th Avenue, a workspace that looks more like what you would expect of a startup than a bank. The workspace is located in the epicenter of the city's ""Silicon Alley,"" an area of the city that is rife with information technology start-ups and corporations. It's an open-office environment, meant to foster a feeling of community. ""I love that our workspace has no offices for the executives,"" says Yoo. ""It says a lot about our culture and values. We also host events and meet-ups, and have an accelerator space for fintech startups, so that we can be a part of the larger tech ecosystem to help drive innovation and inclusion in banking."" ""And, our space is just fun, too,"" Yoo says. ""Table tennis is popular in the office, and the data scientists, being who they are, collect stats and determine rankings."" "
Mashable.com,http://mashable.com/2016/01/07/goodbye-to-dieting-brandspeak/#edOVgZ5g4mqC," Every January, there is, on average, a diet message on TV or the Internet every three seconds. That is, in a word, overkill. It’s uncalled for. But we’re not gonna take it anymore. And you shouldn’t, either! This year, it’s time to take a stand. Time to kick dieting to the curb, once and for all. To band together and declare in one unified voice that we will not be influenced to dabble in the unsustainable, sometimes ridiculous fad diets that pop up incessantly everywhere we turn. That we will not be guilted into passing on a piece of birthday cake. That the occasional late-night dessert run is not so bad, and that carbs are most certainly not the enemy. In 2016, let’s take the time to focus on the more important things in life — the accomplishments that can’t be measured by a scale or waistline. Let’s focus on and recognize your familial and professional accomplishments, and all the other things you do that make the world a better place for you and those around you. And dietarily speaking, let’s adopt sustainable, achievable nutrition and wellness practices that help us achieve our health goals. Instead of dieting, let’s band together in pursuit of the innumerable benefits that come with living a healthy lifestyle, and leave dieting guilt and shame by the wayside. Sound good? Great. This is exciting! Now, not that you need our help, necessarily, but we’d like to offer it anyway, by way of our new#WeighThis Diet Filter— a Google Chrome™ plug-in that blocks out the word “diet” every time it comes across your browser. And while you filter out the word diet, we’ll make a donation toGirls Leadership, an organization that empowers and assists girls by teaching them skills to know who they are, what they believe and how to express it. The #WeighThisDietFilter will help you keep the incessant diet references out of sight, sound and mind, so you can keep your focus on the things that really matter. Additionally, we’ve 3D-printed a limited number of prototype diet filter devices that are programmed to mute the word “diet” anytime it’s said on your television. Together, we can begin to shift the conversation about health, wellness and a life well-lived by tipping the conversational scales from fad diets to better, more wholesome ways to measure our successes.

Mashable.com,http://mashable.com/2016/01/06/ces-2016-smart-home/#JpERPsqPPkqb,"By Corinne Bagish Promoted by By Corinne Bagish Promoted by During and leading up to CES, the tech space is abuzz with the latest on all that is new and shiny. Innovative, sleeker-than-ever devices will be unveiled to a hungry crowd, and the hype will be amplified via an explosion of coverage. These cutting-edge gadgets are quite literally on display, and it's hard not to be dazzled by the user-friendly interfaces, the outstanding resolution, the slim design. But, what about the lesser-told story? Namely, the brains behind these smart devices and the faces behind the scenes: the people that have pushed forward to innovate, to create the tech that captivates us all during CES. Mashablecaught up with five key players in the smart home realm attending CES 2016. We got to know them — what drives them, when their love of tech was born and what they see for the future of the industry as the Internet of Things reimagines our daily lives.  Smart home integrated smoke alarm with weather and natural disaster alerts Ben Staggwas raised in the farm country of central Ohio. Now, based in North Carolina, he’s father to four kids and CEO and founder of Halo Smart Labs, a company reimagining the role of the smoke alarm and changing how emergency communications reach us. Ben Stagg was an entrepreneur from the start. ""My own earliest memory of an 'entrepreneurial streak,' if you will, is when I used to go to work with my grandmother. She was the director of volunteers at the Ohio Historical Society — it was a huge three-story building with history and artifacts,"" says Stagg. ""At 7 years old, I used to take a little cart and fill it with artifacts, and for 50 cents, I’d take people on tours and introduce them to the artifacts.” Tech also came into his life early on. ""In 1991 my dad brought home our first PC, and it was cutting edge,"" he recalls. Stagg’s father, a blue collar civil engineer, knew a good thing when he saw it. ""He came home with this computer one day and said, 'This is the future. Communication is the key to how we’re all going to move forward as a human race.' For my dad to say something so technically advanced is one thing, for my dad to say something so profound — it certainly stuck with me,"" says Stagg. So, Stagg turned his focus to technology. ""I took my dad’s advice. I realized that computing was the future for how we were going to communicate."" Instilling an appreciation for tech was not the only way Stagg's father influenced his path — in fact, Halo Smart Labs was born from a harrowing experience of his.  On Sunday, May 22nd, 2011, Stagg’s father was working in his barn. ""Just like every tinkerer in my family ever, there was a radio playing in the background. He just happened to get a weather warning over the radio,"" says Stagg. Stagg’s father lived just outside of Joplin, Missouri. When he walked outside, the tornado, which would take over 150 lives, was heading his way. Even with advanced warning and just a bit of lead time because of the broadcast, he barely made it to the neighbor’s storm cellar. ""The winds were so strong that the two grown men in the cellar couldn’t close the cellar doors,"" says Stagg. Stagg was working in product development at the time, and his father’s close call was pivotal. ""I committed myself to finding a way to leverage what I knew — mass distribution, messaging and technology solutions — to find a better way to deliver emergency communications when and where people needed them."" The smoke alarm, a household staple through which emergency communication is relayed, seemed a natural vessel. The two models, Halo and Halo+ are equip with light and voice notifications, and connect to your devices. Both detect smoke and carbon monoxide, and the + model integrates customizable alerts, including weather radio. Although the products' official launch dates were just announced at CES, they've already been put to good use. And we mean good use —Halo Smart Labs and the Red Crosshave partnered to prevent disaster in Nairobi slums, where unsafe cooking practices and electrical infrastructure commonly result in rapidly spreading fires. Smart Lock, keypad and Wi-Fi doorbell camera system Jason Johnsonstarted his first company in 1997. Since then, he's gone on to launch three more — his most recent endeavor is August, which he co-founded with designer extraordinaireYves Behar(of Jawbone, OUYA and more) in 2012. The concept is the stuff of the future: The August Smart Lock auto-opens and auto-locks behind you — just you — when you approach and enter your home. You can extend virtual keys to guests and set notifications to track when your loved ones arrive home. Johnson, a self-described smart home junkie, lives in San Francisco with his wife, his 6-year-old son and his dog. ""I truly love this stuff … my dog has a dog door that’s like something out ofStar Trek— it only opens for him,"" he laughs. Originally from Portland, Oregon, Johnson's love for tech blossomed when he was only a bit older than his son is now. ""I had the most awesome grandfather a little boy could ever imagine. His basement was full of gadgets and televisions and stereos that were all disassembled. He was the kind of cool grandfather that let a kid have at it. There were no restrictions."" Function and design — the crux at which August's success lives — was also a theme early on. ""I was clued into things like Sony Walkman … I remember as a kid looking into the different enclosures that went into the product,"" he recalls. ""The goal when you're making a physical product is that you want it to do something  — in Sony's case, to play music — but you recognize that it's something that’s going to be a part of somebody’s everyday life ... you want to think about how that physically represents itself."" And, according to Johnson, what makes a product design truly great is an element of magic: ""Good product design will always have something about it that you didn't expect,"" he says. ""When you experience that little piece of magic, you think, 'Wow, that's cool.' If you deliver that magic, it's really satisfying as a product developer to see that reaction, to hear people talk about it."" August's approach builds in that magic — and continues to stack it on. Aside from developing a suite of products beyond the Smart Lock (including a smart keypad and a doorbell cam for home security), August has partnered with different goods and services providers to prioritize another quality we value in our day-to-days: convenience. October 2015-launched August Access allows user to provide secure home entry remotely for partner services like Handy, Postmates, Shyp and Sears Home Services. ""If technology can save us time, make our lives easier and make us safer and more informed, we can spend more of our time doing things that are more enriching than having to worry about, say, getting paper towels,"" says Johnson.  Temperature regulating and energy-saving Smart Vent system In March 2013,Nayeem Hussainco-founded Keen Home. Keen Home’s Smart Vent product allows the user to regulate temperature room-by-room — it retrofits to your home's existing vent system and connects via wireless for easy control. The 32-year-old didn’t always intend to be an entrepreneur, but when he looks to his past, the signs stack up and it all feels right. ""You can only live life forward, but going back, I can see the things that brought me to where I am today,” he says. “Not only that, but the realization that this really is my calling and now I can’t picture myself doing anything else."" It all began with the gene pool: ""Higher education and that quest for knowledge is something that’s been on both sides of my family — both my father's and mother's side — for many generations,"" says Hussain. His parents, born in Bangladesh, moved to Japan to pursue their PhD's in microbiology. From there, they came to New Jersey for their post-doctoral fellowships — and that's where Hussain was born. The family traveled often; Hussain and his brother were particularly enthralled with Japan, and its robust tech culture. ""Traveling combined with the way that my parents were both very academic and knowledge-driven kind of made me who I am in the sense that it instilled a curiosity in me from a very young age,"" reflects Hussain. ""Not only in how people lived, and what their cultures were like, but of how things worked."" Hussain went on to pursue what he calls ""a pretty vanilla path,"" majoring in finance and economics and working in financial services for his early professional career. Things began to change when he landed at NYU to pursue his MBA: ""I joined an entrepreneurship competition with who is now my cofounder,Ryan [Fant]. We had this idea for Keen Home and entered it into the contest to really just learn about entrepreneurship and validate the idea."" It took off from there. ""One thing led to another, and we were on the startup battlefield at TechCrunch Disrupt, which is obviously a huge piece of validation. We kind of looked at each other and said, 'We'd be foolish not to put our heart and soul into this,'"" recalls Hussain. The path to success hasn’t been without challenges. ""I don't think anyone is ever truly, fully prepared for the amount of sacrifice that you have to be willing to engage in when you start your own company,"" says Hussein, who has been married five years. ""The sacrifices you have to make with friends, family in order to really put everything you have to get something off the ground — it's really hard to estimate that."" Now, over two years into launching Keen Home, with a successfulShark Tankappearance under their belt (the company was given a 5.7 million valuation, one of the biggest in the show's history), over a million in funding and products on the shelves of 600 Lowe's stores, it's safe to say Hussain has given it his all. ""I've wholly embraced entrepreneurship … it's very fulfilling on a fundamental level."" And, Hussain and crew continue to innovate — this year at CES, Keen Home unveiled the Smart Filter addition to the Smart Vent system. ""Not only are we able to control the amount of airflow you receive on a room-to-room level — it's like having a thermostat in every room — but now you'll be able to purify the airflow throughout your home."" A smart kitchen tool that scans barcodes and syncs with your phone Rob Katcheris co-founder of hiku, a smart household shopping tool that allows you to scan and use voice commands to instantly add items to your grocery list. Best of all, these functions are all via a single shiny (and durable) button that attaches to your fridge. Katcher, a family man, lives in San Jose, California with his wife and three children. Katcher worked in tech even prior to developing hiku and has lived in Silicon Valley since 2002. ""It's going to take a crow bar to get me out of here,"" he laughs. Hiku boasts some not-so-glamorous origins: It was bedtime for Katcher's youngest, and there were no sleep diapers to be found in the house. Needless to say, it was a messy situation. ""The pain point was so real for us. We were so frustrated,"" he laughs, recalling that fateful night in late 2011. ""My wife and I are not the best planners — we're not inherently organized,"" he continues. ""The running joke in my family is that we call it a 'win' when everyone has clean underwear."" Katcher recognized that he and his wife weren't alone in their predicament: ""There's a general sentiment among families that they can't do it all — it's not just us; it's not just our house. You have jobs and kids, and the kids have activities and school, and everything kind of piles up. Just doing the maintenance becomes hard."" This incident was the straw that broke the camel's back, and it was time to act. Katcher became enthralled with the idea of a single button that could make life simpler. ""People ask me about the Internet of Things in the Home, and I think that technology should just be invisible, as invisible as possible … and it's so genuinely hard. A lot of complexity goes into making something invisible."" Katcher and a team of primarily former colleagues (he'd worked in the mobile space) pooled their talent to bring hiku to life. From an industry perspective, it felt like the right time: ""By the time 2012 was rolling around, mobile felt pretty mature to me. Like, 'Okay, I think we know what to expect from a smartphone,'"" Katcher says. ""The thought was, and I'm geeking out now from a technical perspective,  that connected devices/the Internet of Things was the next mobile. That we were at the very, very early stages of devices at the edge of the network, of specialized devices that collect data and plug in to the mobile ecosystem."" The product, which began shipping in fall 2013, is in its second iteration. The newly improved hiku was announced in November, and features upgrades in scanning functionality and voice recognition, plus integrates with major retailers like Walmart and Peapod for grocery delivery. a Wi-Fi connected robotic ball Omar Barlas and his brother Ozair banded together to invent Orbii (branded as SensorSphere until just a few weeks ago), a small robotic ball with a large array of functionality. The modular design allows the user to swap out panels with different functions: a temperature and humidity gauge, carbon monoxide sensor, a speaker, an HD camera, a microphone and more. The implications extend beyond just home security, which was the original function for which Barlas, a father of two, developed the product. Barlas grew up in Pakistan and moved to the U.S. about 10 years ago. Tech has been an interest of his from the get-go: In the 10th grade, Barlas created his very first robotics project — a humanoid with movable arms. ""I've always been involved in robotics as a hobby,"" he says. ""Contests, hackathons ... always some kind of robotics."" He went on to spend over 20 years in software consulting, when the idea for Orbii came to him. ""It's a very strange story. One day I was in the market shopping for HD cameras for home security. My neighbor had told me that there'd been break-ins in this community, so I thought I'd secure my home before something happened,"" he recalls. ""I looked at a couple of options — Nest, Canary. I quickly realized that if I want to secure my whole home, I'd need multiple units set up."" After crunching the numbers, Barlas determined that the price was too hefty to secure his whole home. The solution? He was going to do it himself; he was going to leverage his robotics know-how to make a camera that could move from room-to-room. Inspired, Barlas decided not to renew his contract at his consulting job. Instead, he and his brother entered a Dallas-based accelerator program. They graduated in September, and at its conclusion, they had a fully functional prototype for Orbii. Barlas envisions even more for the already multi-functional device. For example, a thermal imaging camera is in the works, which may have major implications for fire safety. ""So for example, think of a firefighter. He gets into the building and he physically put the thermal imaging camera on and throws the ball into the building. He can drive it around and look for survivors,"" he explains.

When it comes to the milk America drinks, cows shouldn’t get all the credit. Dairy farmers like Dave and Laurie Kyle of Elkhorn, Wis., put in just as much hard work as their bovine counterparts. Morning for these dairy producers starts early. By 4:30, the Kyles and their farmhands are up for the first of two rounds of milking their 110 registered Holstein cows. While the cows are in the milking parlor, Dave is busy cleaning the barn, replenishing bedding and filling watering units with fresh water. Next, it’s time to feed the girls a nutritious breakfast of farm-grown hay, corn and silage (a high-moisture feed that is often made from grass crops that provides many of the nutrients present in plants) mixed with soybean meal and Milwaukee malted rye. (During the warmer months, the cows also graze on fresh pasture.) Dave meets with a local nutritionist weekly, and feed blends are customized to meet each cow’s current dietary needs, based on her weight and milk production level. Afternoons are more varied, yet still just as busy. In the summer, it’s often the time to hop on the tractor and harvest feed crops. When the Kyles aren’t harvesting, they’ll often tend to other tasks, such as any variety of farm-related repairs. “When you’re a farmer, you have to be good at being an electrician, plumber and mechanic, because you can’t really afford to pay outside vendors,” Laurie admits. There’s also checking in with veterinarians and testing milk for quality and safety. This includes testing for antibiotic residues — a process that takes place up to eight times before the milk is sent to the local processing plant. Setting aside time each day to simply observe the cows’ behavior is also essential to ensure that they’re healthy. On some days, the Kyles give farm tours, too. “It’s cool to see kids’ faces light up when they pet the calves that were born a week ago, because most families don’t know where their food comes from,” says Laurie. While Dave spends much of his day on the farm, Laurie, a nutrition educator, can usually be found at Perkup Elkhorn, the coffee shop she opened in 2012 to forge deeper community connections and earn additional income. “Because I’m passionate about agriculture and healthy eating, it seemed like a perfect fit. The message that I have is that American agriculture is alive and well, and farmers are still some of the most trustworthy individuals that are providing wholesome products for all,” she says. When she isn’t chatting with customers about milk’s vast nutritional benefits, she’s tackling bookwork for the farm in the back office. Dave might stop in for a bit to discuss bills, but it’s back to the farm by 4:30 p.m. for the day’s second round of milking, cleaning and feeding. After working as long as 17 hours, he finally arrives back home. Like most families, long days and busy schedules—including working around 16-year-old daughter Mackenzie’s travel softball games and practices and 20-year-old son Hayden’s college course load—mean the Kyles don’t get to eat dinner together as often as they might like. But it’s a small sacrifice to make in exchange for a truly rewarding outcome. “Knowing you’re producing wholesome products for people and doing it by rolling up your sleeves and working hard, there’s a real pride involved in that,” says Laurie.

Slate.com,http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/ibm/2015/06/the_new_face_of_organized_crime.html,"This Content is made possible by our Sponsor; it is not written by and does not necessarily reflect the views ofSlate's editorial staff. You could call 2014 the year of the hack. From Michael’s, the nation’s largest chain of craft stores, which reported that data from an estimated 2.6 million bank cards was exposed, to Community Health Systems, which endured an attack on some 4.5 million patient records, the twelve months of 2014 were filled with cybercrime. Other high-profile hacks targeted UPS, Goodwill, JP Morgan Chase and Sony. It appeared no organization was immune. And 2015 isn't looking any safer. A new report fromForrester Researchpredicts at least 60 percent of businesses could face a breach of sensitive data this year. Just last month, international hackers were suspected of stealing 100,000 taxpayers’ data from the Internal Revenue Service.And although in the Sony case, it was the inflammatory leaked emails and cancellation of “The Interview,” (a caper about a plot to assassinate North Korea's leader) that made headlines, hackers also stole more than47,000 Social Security numbersof Sony’s current and former employees. Also stolen were a number of files that had personal information such as birth dates and home addresses, making identity theft a concern alongside the political statement. The proliferation of security breaches is due in part to the increased sophistication of hackers. These are not the clueless kids who instigated a nuclear attack in the 1983 movie, “WarGames.”  “The adversary we are up against is not a bored teenager,” said Caleb Barlow, a vice president with IBM security. Hacking 9-to-5 “Highly organized criminal gangs,” Barlow said, are generating about 80 percent of cybercrimes. They operate from cubicle farms just like regular businesses, keeping office hours and taking off on the weekends. The difference is that when they turn out the lights on Friday, they often flip the on switch to launch an attack — especially if it’s right before a holiday weekend. Then, Barlow said, the breach can go undetected longer while regular workers are off the clock. To get a sense of the level of sophistication, Barlow describedoneattackcampaign he and the IBM security team were tracking calledThe Dyre Wolf. The campaign uses a new variant of the Dyre banking Trojan, so named because it rolls into computer operating systems via an innocent-looking source such as an email, then waits until a user starts a high-value transaction. Once a customer starts that transaction — say a wire transfer — he sees a webpage from what looks like the bank with a number to call to fix an issue with his account. Unfortunately, what looks to the user like a standard security measure instead connects him to the team working for the cyber crooks. The person on the phone speaks in unaccented English and proceeds to act like a regular banking customer service representative, validating all the user’s credentials and capturing them for potential future thefts. Hackers simultaneously instilled a false sense of safety in users while seizing funds in excess of $500,000 per transaction. In some cases, Barlow said, attacks like these come with a money-back guarantee from hackers who are raking in millions. The High Cost of Cybercrime Security breaches can take almost a year to discover. According to the latest research from Ponemon Institute, malicious attacks can take an average of 256 days to identify. Nearly half (47 percent) of all breaches in this year’s study were caused by malicious or criminal attacks. Financial and operational loss is sure to follow, not to mention the cost of repairing a damaged reputation. According to Ponemon’s 2015 benchmark study of 350 companies in 11 countries, the average consolidated total cost of a data breach is $3.8 million, a 23 percent bump up since 2013. The average cost to resolve these attacks varies by industry. For instance in healthcare, the cost per stolen record can be as high as $363, but the average across all industries is $154 per record. Do You Really Have Control of Your Data? Even companies trying to be proactive about protecting their data can have blind spots that leave them open to costly breaches, Barlow said. “It’s easy for organizations to get enamored by one slice of the problem,” and put all their resources into plugging up one particular data stream. But a sophisticated attack can penetrate an organization on multiple levels, especially as employees ramp up their use of personal devices on the job or use software that is not vetted and secured by their employer. File sharing or e-signature applications can be weak spots, and storing data unsecured in the cloud also increases the risk of exposure. “If you are not providing employees with the right tools to do their jobs they will go out and get on their own account,” Barlow said. “If their account gets hijacked or they leave, you don’t have control.” Bringing on an outside security specialist can help, Barlow said, but is not enough. Companies should put an emergency response plan in place as well and drill staff on what to do if the worst happens. Barlow also recommends discussing the impact of breaches ahead of time with vendors, law enforcement, and legal counsel, to build the “muscle memory” of reaction to save precious time and money. Ponemon’s research indicates that board member involvement reduces the cost by $5.50 per record and business continuity management further reduces costs by an average of $7.10 per compromised record. Pinterest for Security Analysts They say what you don’t know can’t hurt you, but in the case of cybercrime, the opposite is true. That’s why IBM recently made its library of threat intelligence data available through theIBM X-Force Exchange, a new cyber-threat intelligence-sharing platform powered by IBM Cloud. Using the X-Force Exchange, enterprises can access one of the largest global catalogs of vulnerabilities, including threat data from the monitoring of 15 billion security events each day, malware threat intelligence from a network of 270 million endpoints, threat data coming from over 25 billion web pages and images, and deep intelligence on more than 8 million spam and phishing attacks. Using this database of historical and real-time indicators of live attacks, security teams can build a centralized, up-to-the-moment view of possible threats. Barlow said the X-Force Exchange amounts to a Pinterest for security analysts who can “pin a hack” and share it with a global audience.  IBM’s security analysts and industry peers can validate findings in hopes of shutting down further breaches. In the month since the exchange launched, more than 1,000 organizations across 16 industries have joined the network and created more than 300 new collections of threat data. ""Cybercrime continues to grow in sophistication and organization, we understand that there is power in numbers to fight back,"" said Rob Bening, ING Bank’s chief information security officer, in a statement. ""Sharing threat information via IBM X-Force Exchange initiative is a big step toward better understanding potential attacks and anticipating measures to mitigate them.""

Guinea worm disease starts with a pain in your leg or foot, then a blister.Eventually, a parasite emerges from the wound. During this time, the pain is often so intense that you might not be able to work, take care of your family, or even walk. It’s horrifying to even think about.But guinea worm has been a thing of the pastfor Ugandanssince 2009. This change from full-blown public health crisis to nearly eradicated in only 30 years is a huge, life-changing deal for communities across the globe.And former President Jimmy Carter made it happen.  Carter visited Lojura, Sudan, in 2010 and was struck by how awful guinea worm is. After this visit, he made eradicating the disease his personal mission. Photo by Peter Martell/ AFP Photo/ Getty Images. Carter’s nonprofit,The Carter Center, launched its guinea worm eradication program 30 years ago, in 1986. When Carter decided to make guinea worm his cause, there were about 3.5 million people suffering from guinea worm infections — and just as daunting, there were no vaccines or medicines to treat it. How did it happen?Hard work, smart public education campaigns, andlotsof clean water. Guinea worm spreads through water. About a year after someone drinks water infected with guinea worm larvae, they get a blister, and the parasite begins to come out of the body. So the most important step was to keep guinea worm larvaeout of drinking water. The center also relied on community health workers to provide education on preventing guinea worm disease. “I’ve sometimes had thousands of students from schools lined up outside on the highway when I come into the village. In Nigeria, they had big signs that said, ‘Watch out, Guinea worm, here comes Jimmy Carter!’ That makes you feel good,” Carter said in a recentNPR interview. There are onlyfour countriesleft with documented guinea worm cases, which means we could see its end very soon.We went from more than 3 million infections to fewer than 25 in just three decades — solely from effective prevention methods. As it approaches the eradication of guinea worm disease, the Carter Center has expanded its focus to include cultivating peace, protecting human rights, and eliminating other harmful diseases in the same way.

Telegraph Media Group,http://www.theguardian.com/teacher-network/2016/feb/03/five-easy-ways-urban-schools-can-experiment-with-outdoor-learning,"Outdoor learning isn’t just the preserve of rural schools. These simple ideas will help you incorporate outdoor learning in a concrete jungle Wed 3 Feb 201608.00 ESTLast modified on Thu 4 Feb 201605.15 EST Whether it’s hunting for minibeasts in the playing fields or reading a book under a tree, thepositive impact of outdoor learning on young people’s achievement and developmentis widely acknowledged. But what do you do if your school isn’t blessed with acres of green space? From making the most of your playground to venturing further afield, we’ve gathered five tips to help urban schools feel the benefits of taking learning outside. It might sound simple but the first thing to do is get outside. As Ian Tokelove fromLondon Wildlife Trustsays: “Ask yourself if a game or activity could work outside. If it could, then go for it.” It could be as simple as asking students to close their eyes and tune into the sounds of the urban world. Games such as follow-my-leader or hide and seek are good for familiarising students with their outdoor space. Older pupils could map the school grounds, identifying their favourite areas and explaining their choices. Nicole Daw, a National Trust ranger atLeigh Woods, Bristol, finds a colour-matching activity works well. She says: “Using some paint charts from your local DIY shop, ask pupils to go outside and find colours that match the charts. Green is a great place to start, but it is incredible how many colours are out there once you really start looking.” One of the great things about outdoor learning is that it spans the curriculum, so you could measure the angles of outdoor structures in maths, investigate how far sounds travel in different weather in science, or use the playground as the setting for a historical re-enactment. At the beginning work with subjects and activities you already feel comfortable with. So if you like doing music inside, take music outside. As Elaine Skates, chief executive of theCouncil for Learning Outside the Classroom, says: “Using your school grounds as a starting point will help build your confidence in teaching in locations other than the classroom.” If you’re pressed for time, plan outdoor activities for just before or after a break time. In secondary schools, arrange to meet your class at an agreed outdoor spot and for primary schools, practise getting outdoor clothes on and off quickly, and keep them in an easily accessible place such as a dressing up box. Mini wildlife gardens, which stay be outside but don’t take much space, are another good idea:bug hotels, bucket ponds andbird boxesare easy and fun to make, and children will enjoy checking to see what creatures have made their homes in them. For very small, concrete playgrounds, Natalie Johnson fromThe Wild Networksuggests bringing in a few old logs or branches from fallen trees to encourage wildlife. For schools with a little more space, you could apply for a free school tree pack from theWoodland Trust. The pack contain 30 saplings, which would cover a space equivalent to the size of one tennis court or create an 8.5m line of hedge. Wildflowers can be grown on a scrap of land; even a small area in the middle of a city will attract wildlife. Planting seeds and bulbs indoors lets children get their hands dirty and helps them understand basic lifecycles. “Watching something grow from seed is magical and fills children with a sense of investment in a little life,” says Tokelove. “It could be a bean planted in a pot on a windowsill or a young sapling planted when a child starts primary school so they can see how it grows with them.” Alternatively, you couldcatch some bugs in outdoor pitfall trapsand bring them inside for students to identify using magnifying glasses. Draw on your local community to find people who can share resources. Parents might be able to get rid of old outdoor clothing or footwear, or ask a local garden centre if they could donate plants or expertise. And don’t forget to bring the outside in with evidence of what you’ve been doing. Indoor displays could include photographs, items that pupils have gathered, and rubbings of different outdoor surfaces. Ideally you want to sit down as a team and have a think about what’s within a 10- or 20-minute walk from your school. There might be shops, a high street or even an art gallery or museum. As Skates says: “For any school, it’s really about what is on their doorstep and remembering that learning can take place in the built environment just as much as the rural environment.” Rather than being a one-off, outings should be a regular part of school life, involving all learners in a year-round, progressive programme that fosters an appreciation of the natural world according to Martin Smith, chair of theEnglish Outdoor Council, an umbrella body for organisations involved in the provision of outdoor education. He adds: “See going outdoors as integral to what you do and not ‘separate’. The outdoor environment is just another resource for you to use. “One day all learning will have to be applied outside the classroom, so let’s start early.” This could be a park, nature reserve or woodland. Discover the wildlife that lives there using hands-on activities such as pond dipping, bug hunting and nature trails. Activities run by environmental organisations such asLearning Through Landscapes, the Institute forOutdoor Learningand theJohn Muir Trustare particularly good. You might also want to look for theLearning Outside the Classroom quality markor consult with alocal outdoor education adviserwhen selecting a venue. London Wildlife Trustis one of 47 Wildlife Trusts thatprovide outdoor learning opportunities to schools across the UK. As Tokelove says: “Together, we have more nature reserves than McDonald’s has restaurants, so you’re never far from a nature reserve, even in a city.” It is worth remembering that outdoor learning experiences are more likely to be successful if you involve young people in their planning and delivery. Pupils can research venues, organise fundraising activities and get involved in any risk-benefit assessment. Another good tip is to share ideas and inspiration with like-minded teachers through local schools and networks. TheLondon Environment Educators Forum, for example, runs events to help practitioners build their skills and share best practice in connecting people to urban nature. The most important thing to remember is that the more you do outdoor learning, the easier it gets. And the benefits for young people – and their teachers – abound."

Vice.com,http://motherboard.vice.com/read/how-holograms-will-help-us-see-the-invisible?ref=brandtale.com,"​ ​ They were on the killer binders the cool kids carried to middle school, and they make appearances on government-issued IDs. The very idea of their existence has captured sci-fi writers' imaginations for decades. Holographic images—occasionally misunderstood, often used for projects both mundane and complex—utilize basic tricks of light and photographic impression that have been in wide use since the 1960s. When artists such asMatthew Schreiber, who created the laser-illuminated holograms in the video above, make images that appear completely three-dimensional to the eye, they owe their process to Dennis Gabor. His 1947 theory described how to mutate light waves in such a way to convince the eye it's perceiving depth when it's not, both from a physiological and psychological standpoint. There are actually two types of holograms in wide use today, and no, the ""Tupac hologram"" doesn't count. (In that case, the ""hologram"" part of the spectacle was tacked on largely for the futuristic ring it had to it; the process was actually a 19th century projection technique referred to as ""Pepper's Ghost."") The embossed, multi-colored holograms that make cameos on your credit cards and Lisa Frank stickers are referred to as reflection holograms, while the large-scale, convincing three-dimensional objects reflected in Schreiber's work are known as transmission holograms. While the former is a simplified, mass-producible trick using a similar process of light diffraction and was invented much later, transmission holograms—in which concentrated light is shone through a plate bearing all the information contained in a three-dimensional image—remain some of the most convincing stationary holographic images. Image:Wikipedia The plates onto which that data is recorded bear no resemblance to the actual image they're intended to render; a holographic plate's function is to record light waves, not objects, and often appears to the naked eye as a blank square. Whereas still photography records light as it bounces off of a single, static image, holographic plates record not just light but its phases and amplitude, or the light waves' various positions in their wave cycle and their relative intensity. To record this data, it's usually necessary to bounce both regular, diffuse white light and hyper-targeted, coherent light off of the intended target so it records that interference and takes an exact snapshot of those beams in a particular moment. Thus, though the idea of the hologram was first theorized by Gabor, it wasn't until the invention of the laser in the early 60s that three-dimensional images were recorded in this manner. When a holographic image is burnt onto a plate—typically a light-sensitive photographic emulsion of a very fine grain—it's often done by splitting a laser's light into two using a beam splitter and routing those beams to their intended targets with a series of mirrors. One beam, the reference beam, is reflected off of a mirror to hit the emulsion straight-on; the other is targeted to hit the object before reflecting onto the plate. When those lights burn into the emulsion, they leave a record of the light structured in such a way that it replays how an object looks from multiple angles. It's a process so fantastically sensitive that even a quarter of a wave movement of light would distort the image and make it unreadable. ​An optical table being used to create a hologram. Image:​Epzcaw/Wikipedia When holograms such as these are projected, monochromatic light is filtered through a lens that diffuses the light somewhat from an angle, illuminating the plate and bouncing the recorded information back to the viewer, who is positioned where the reference beam once was. When the eye detects this light, it interprets the combination of shadows, angles, and reflections as a complete, three dimensional image. Of course, there are numerous ways in which holograms are now produced and viewed; scientists have manipulated ultrasound waves to create three-dimensional images that appearto float in the airand the push towards a more perfectly augmented reality has inspired another generation ofhologram-dependent gadgets. But while the technology used to trick your brain may be becoming more advanced, its core principles remain similar to those of simpler transmission holograms such as Schreiber's—Microsoft's HoloLense, for instance, is equipped with a variety of sensors that guess in which direction you're gazing so it can more accurately trick your brain into seeing what isn't there. ©2020 VICE MEDIA LLC"
Vice.com,http://motherboard.vice.com/read/apogees-forgotten-retro-game-classics?ref=brandtale.com,"Duke Nukem, pre-Jon St. John. As influential as game developer Apogee would become, and for as early in my own gaming history its work appeared, Apogee's games didn't land on the same pantheons of classics like Sonic the Hedgehog, Spyro, and Super Mario. Games likeCrystal Caves,Word RescueandMonster Bashwere seldom spoken of, largely because of they were more difficult to access than retail games. Apogee games, like many inconveniently distributed DOS titles, make up a once secret history in retro gaming's timeline. They're games that could be mistaken for things you've made up, undocumented incidents brewed by your childhood imagination. Apogee has since rebranded as 3D Realms, best known for Duke Nukem's messy adventures, and this month, the company dusted off a crate in the attic and releasedan impressive new anthology on Steam. Some of these games were available on Steam or Good Old Games before, but this collection is dense, with 32 relics in total. On top ofMonster BashandWord Rescueare games that had completely vacated my headspace since I had last actively played them, such asSecret AgentandHalloween Harry, though I've not forgotten the fizzy, crumbly boom sounds of thunderbolts, flamethrowers, and doors shutting. Each early DOS game had sound effects like a squeal of a different annoying exotic bird. Nintendo, survivors and dominators of apost 80s game crashworld, had firmly planted the focus of interactive computer entertainment on TV consoles. Apple and home computers were left with smaller text adventure or generally basic ventures. Computers at the time struggled to handle the constantly scrolling, generating worlds made a staple by Super Mario Bros. It was an infamous conundrumsolved by John Carmack, who figured out you could save the computer stress by dividing visual elements so that constant colours, like the sky, would be static, and the hardware could focus on introducing everything else. This led to a watershed moment in PC gaming:Commander Keen, a game that illustrated DOS gaming's potential, which was distributed but not developed by Apogee. After that hurdle, these smoother, bigger games started rolling. Playing through this 3D Realms' anthology is to play through a clear timeline of the era's development. Despite there being games with shockingly similar elements in level design and enemy types, you can sense a lot of exploration, a lot of feeling out, as if the company was designing video games with no one watching. The way they evolve in such quick succession is staggering: a three-coloured platformer likeArctic Adventurein 1991 looks nothing like a fully fleshed-out first-person shooter likeBlake Stonein 1993. Monster Bash,Monuments of Mars,Cosmo's Cosmic AdventureandWord Rescuehave clumsy controls, and the spaces the characters inhabit fit jaggedly and awkwardly. There are funny stylistic juxtapositions: the mutants ofBio Menacelook all cute and goofy like Barney and friends, but they still blow up into chum chunks of gore and bone when you obliterate them.

For all the stumbles, there are some true classics in the collection.Crystal Caves,Arctic AdventureandSecret Agent, bland as they may sound, are some of the best DOS had to offer. That's not to mentionDuke NukemandDuke Nukem II, solid running gunning platformers before 3D graphics, womanizing, and Jon St. John redefined the buzzcut avenger. As good as many of these games were, they were never meant for the limelight. DOS games, usually distributed as shareware, rarely achieved the same commercial gratitude as retail console games of that time. Back in those days, the games were downloaded off the web, or shared on disks by relatives (thanks Aunt Diane!), or ordered directly from their companies.Apogee had about two employees filling out orders manually over the phone.Wolfenstein 3D,Doom,Commander KeenandJazz Jackrabbitwere exceptions to the rule, while the humble Apogee games in this collection were distributed in the same fashion. Archaic distribution methods, while functional for those studios at the time, limited the reach and legacy of many of these games. Even the re-releases still come with ordering info and mailing addresses on the main menu. So while many were influential, to other game makers or a pocket of your adolescence that's washed away like tears in the rain, they literally didn't have the same presence as the other games deemed classic. Now, with the games market oddly but inevitably returning to digital distribution, you can unearth some real lost treasures.

Vox.com,http://www.vox.com/2016/2/3/10898326/case-for-housing-investment,"Lots of people think buying a house is a good investment — in fact, many American households have a lot more money invested in home equity than in the stock market. But a lot of economists think people are making a mistake. George Mason University economist Alex Tabarrok is the latest to make the case thathousing is overratedas an investment. Tabarrok sees two big problems with viewing your home as an investment vehicle. First, stocks tend to go up in value and pay dividends; homes often don't. And second, buying a house ""locks people to location, making it harder to move for jobs."" Many people who bought homes in Detroit in the early 2000s, for example, wound up laid offandwith an underwater mortgage. But both of these arguments are weaker than they seem. And they ignore a huge psychological benefit of homeownership. Obviously, buying a home isn't for everyone. But if you have a financially stable job and expect to live in the same area for more than a decade, buying a house is usually a savvy financial move. Tabarrok andother economists like Robert Shillerargue that houses don't have a great financial track record. And if you just look at house prices, that's true. The value of houses did go up a lot between the mid-1980s and 2007, but if you look at the past 120 years — including down periods like the Great Depression — home values haven't increased much faster than the rate of inflation. But that doesn't mean houses aren't a good investment. The return on any financial investment comes from two factors: price appreciation and dividends. Some stocks make money for investors by quickly increasing in value. But others generate returns by paying out generous dividends. And while it's true, as Tabarrok writes, that houses don't literally pay out dividends, they do something even better: If you own one, you can live there rent-free. That housing has real cash value, because it means you don't have to pay rent to live somewhere else. How valuable is this de facto housing dividend? It depends on the house and the state of the market, of course. But take my personal situation as an example. If I were renting my Washington, DC, house instead of owning it, I'd be paying roughly 5 percent of its value in rent each year. So in effect, owning a house provides me with a housing ""dividend"" of around 5 percent of the home's value (minus maintenance costs, taxes, insurance, and other expenses, which in my case adds up to around 1 percent of the home's value). That compares favorably with the stock market, where companies pay annual dividends worth only about2.2 percent of the stock's value. Of course, it's true that stocks do appreciate in value more quickly than houses, so the overall rate of return on stocks is probably higher than the rate of return on housing. On the other hand, house prices are a lot less volatile than stock prices. An inflation-adjusted rate of return of around 4 percent — with very low risk — makes housing a pretty attractive investment option. Finally, the tax code provides huge advantages to homeownership. The interest you pay on a home mortgage is tax-deductible. If you sell your house, the appreciated value of the home is exempt from capital gains taxes up to $250,000 (and twice that for married couples). And whereas you have to pay taxes on stock dividends and bond interest payments, there's no taxes due on the free housing you get as a homeowner. The value of these tax advantages depends in part on your income, but generally speaking, the wealthier you are, the better deal it is to buy a house. The second big argument against owning a house has to do with diversification, a fundamental principle of good investment. That's the idea that you shouldn't put all of your eggs in one basket; instead of putting all of your money into one hot technology stock, you should buy a broad portfolio of stocks — such as the S&P 500 index of 500 large American companies. That's because the value of any single stock fluctuates more than the market as a whole, so buying a broader portfolio allows you to get the same high returns at lower risk. Buying a huge, illiquid asset like a house seems to fly in the face of this principle. If you have the bad luck to buy a house in a declining neighborhood — or at the peak of a housing bubble, like in 2007 — you could wind up having your home equity totally wiped out. So, the argument goes, it might be better to keep renting and put the down payment in a broad stock market portfolio. But this ignores a crucial fact about human beings: If we don't own a house, then we have to pay rent every month. And rent is itself highly volatile. As renters living in a high-cost area will tell you, one of the biggest fears is that rents will rise faster than their incomes, pricing them out of a neighborhood they love. In Wall Street lingo, everyone is born with a short position on housing. From this perspective, a house isn't a risky bet on the housing market. Rather, it's an insurance policy against the volatility that everyone faces if they don't buy a house. Of course, there's some truth to Tabarrok's argument that buying a house makes it harder to move to a new city if a regional downturn hammers the local housing market and the job market simultaneously. But the significance of this factor depends a lot on your situation. If you're an autoworker in Detroit or an oil worker in Houston or North Dakota, you should think twice before betting your family's nest egg on a house. But other jobs aren't like that. If you're a tenured schoolteacher, a doctor, or an IT professional, you can probably count on having work in any economic environment. And if you live in a diversified economy like New York or Chicago, there's less reason to worry about a decline in any single industry triggering a region-wide housing meltdown. And once you get married and have a family, moving to a new city becomes a lot more difficult anyway. Even if you get laid off, your spouse's job, your children's education, your church, and your social life are all going to be tied to your current location. While young people often job-hop to a new city in search of opportunity, this becomes less and less practical as people get older. And once you reach retirement, your livelihood likely won't be tied to the local economy anyway. Your Social Security checks and 401(k) earnings will be the same no matter where you live. So locking in a predictable cost of housing is far more important than preserving the option to move to a new city. Ultimately, the most important advantage of buying a home has more to do with psychology than financial considerations: Buying a home is an excellent way to force yourself to save a few hundred dollars every month. Suppose you're paying $1,000 in rent and you calculate that buying a similar home would cost $1,400 per month (once mortgage insurance, taxes, maintenance, and other costs are factored in). In principle, it should be possible to continue renting, put the extra $400 per month into an IRA, and wind up with a substantial nest egg after a decade or two. In practice, that rarely happens. Unless you're unusually disciplined, you're likely to spend a lot of that $400 per month, leaving you with little or no extra savings. But once you buy the home, you have no choice but to find the money to make the mortgage payment every month. And every mortgage payment is going to include a few hundred dollars that goes toward paying down the principal on the loan. After 30 years, you're going to own a house — without making a conscious effort to save. In practice, I suspect this effect dwarfs most other considerations in the renting-versus-buying debate. It's a lot easier to make financial sacrifices for a tangible, short-term goal like owning a home than an abstract, long-term goal like accumulating enough stocks and bonds to retire in your 60s. While buying a house will eventually be a good idea for most people, it's not for everyone at all ages. The big thing to remember is that buying a house and then selling it again costs about 7 percent of the home's value, which in some areas can translate to tens of thousands of dollars. So you should only buy a house if you're confident you'll want to live in it for a long time — at least five years, and probably 10. If you're in your 20s, single, or have a career that might require relocating to a new city, it may be too early to buy a house. You should also wait if you're expecting a big change in your income soon, or if you're in a particularly volatile job situation — like a Silicon Valley startup or the North Dakota oil fields. But for most people — especially once they're married and have a stable career — buying a house is an excellent financial decision. Get our newsletter in your inbox twice a week."

Just look at fitness gurus Jane Fonda and the late Jack LaLanne, seniors who have demonstrated the benefits of exercise well past 65. The advantages of getting more exercise in your golden years are manifest. Not only does regular exercise make you look, feel and think better, you just might live longer and have a better quality of life.""While we lose muscle mass and our endurance slows as we age, what has always been assumed was part of the normal aging process is made much worse by having a sedentary lifestyle than by merely aging,"" said John Hanrahan, Fitness Center coordinator at Westminster Place, a Presbyterian Homes retirement community in suburban Chicago. ""The saying 'use it or lose it' is absolutely true. We can add muscle to improve strength, increase cardiovascular endurance and improve balance at any age.""A study published in June by the Oregon State University College of Public Health and Human Sciences showed that 300 minutes a week of light exercise provides significant health benefits for people over age 65. Older adults who engaged in light exercise were 18% healthier overall than their less-active peers. Moreover, light exercise is less likely to cause injuries than moderate to vigorous exercise.According to OSU professor and study co-author Brad Cardinal, active older adults have lower body mass index, smaller waist circumferences and more balanced insulin levels and are less likely to be afflicted by chronic diseases.Westminster Place offers many options and opportunities for residents to improve and maintain their fitness.""We have a beautiful fitness center with a well-appointed gym and two pools,"" Hanrahan said. ""We offer group exercise classes for just about everyone. There are land and water classes, seated and standing classes at different times of the day spread throughout our campus.""Water aerobics, yoga and balance classes are among the more popular offerings, said Hanrahan, who thinks that adults should engage in water aerobics for the energy and group camaraderie, yoga for the physical, mental and perhaps spiritual aspects, and balance classes because balance is something that we all need to work on: ""Even some of us less than 'senior age,' since our balance begins to decline in our 30s.""Exercise is part of the new initiative ""Choices: A Program for Living Well"" introduced at Presbyterian Homes and designed to focus on aspects of wellness identified by the International Council on Active Aging.The program teaches the multidimensional aspects of healthy living, offering many choices for active older adults based on their interests. The content was based largely on feedback from residents at the five Presbyterian Homes communities in the Greater Chicago area.Beyond physical health, the program includes six other wellness dimensions — social, emotional, spiritual, intellectual, community and environmental. The new program is part of a larger campaign by Presbyterian Homes to ensure that residents achieve the highest level of well-being in mind, body and spirit.Residents at Westminster Place can also sign up for a national senior fitness test to track personal goals over time. And Hanrahan has designed a fitness boot camp that starts in October for adults seeking a more intense class or heavier workout to achieve their goals.""We'll focus on building strength and endurance by mixing cardio and strength exercises in functional and fun ways,"" Hanrahan said. ""It'll be a new program for us, but I think people will really enjoy it."" —Joe Yogerst for Presbyterian Homes"

There is no question that challenges can arise during our ""Golden Years"" — but there are also many benefits and upsides to getting older. ""I notice that I seem to savor even very simple pleasures, things that I used to be too busy to pay attention to,"" says Barbara Jones, who moved into a Presbyterian Homes retirement community in the Greater Chicago area a little over a month ago.""Things like the antics of a squirrel, a beautiful fall moon, a good book, the perfect serving of creme brûlée. As the pace of your life slows down a bit, there is more time to strengthen and enjoy relationships with friends and family. Not so many instances of 'I don't have time this week.'""A number of studies in recent years have shown that happy seniors live longer and healthier lives.According to a 2012 article in theJournal of the American Medical Association, older adults who look upon their age positively are 44% more likely to fully recover from a bout of disability.The study that the article was based on – ""Association Between Positive Age Stereotypes and Recovery From Disability in Older Persons"" – was carried out by a group of doctors led by Dr. Becca R. Levy, associate professor at the Yale School of Public Health.Levy also carried an earlier study that found that older individuals with more positive self-perceptions of aging lived on average 7.5 years longer than those with less positive self-perceptions of aging.Jones, who had a 40-year career in nursing before retiring, says that one of the things she has come to learn with age is that physical limitations that naturally result from aging don't necessarily mean that you have to give up a favorite activity.""You can often make modifications,"" she explains. ""For example, if flying has become a hassle, use your airline points for an upgrade to business class, so you have a roomier seat. If night driving is a problem, switch your subscriptions to the symphony, opera or theater to matinees. Or buddy up with someone who can still drive at night. If you have balance issues that make you nervous in crowded places, buy a cane to give you some stability. It also warns people, so they will avoid bumping into you. ""Keeping a positive attitude and staying active are lessons that fellow Westminster Place resident Frank McCabe has learned to master over the years. Approaching his late 80s and retired from a real estate career, McCabe only had to shift one block away from his old house when he moved into the Presbyterian Homes community in Evanston two years ago and plunged head-on into new commitments.""I like to be active,"" McCabe said, reeling off a long list of the various things he's involved with at Westminster Place.""I'm on the welcoming committee,"" he said. ""I'm on the New Hope committee — which is a group of us that raises fund to provide scholarships for employees here who want to further their education or for non-citizens who want to become citizens but who don't have the money to apply for citizenship. I'm on the residents' advisory council, which meets monthly and looks at various situations affecting the residents. And I'm chairman of the buildings and grounds committee.""Jones says her main focus at Westminster Place has been getting to know people and learning about the many and varied activities and programs. She has also attended several community lunches and several interesting lectures. But looking forward, she plans on attending the monthly organ concert in the chapel and any other musical programs offered. Classes at the Fitness Center are also on her ""to do"" list. But Jones has also learned that it's okay to have a lazy day once in a while and stay home, read a book or listen to music without feeling guilty. ""Although it's equally important to make every effort to stay involved in favorite activities — church, music, book club, etc."" —Joe Yogerst for Presbyterian Homes"
TheDailyBeast.com,http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/02/15/exclusive-whistleblowers-warned-top-spy-about-skewed-isis-intel.html,"It wasn’t just the generals who were warned that ISIS intelligence assessments were overly rosy. The office of the director of national intelligence knew, too. U.S. military analysts told the nation’s top intelligence official that their reports on ISIS were skewed and manipulated by their bosses, The Daily Beast has learned. The result: an overly optimistic account of the campaign against the terror group. The complaints, lodged by analysts at U.S. Central Command in 2015, are separate from allegations that analystsmade to the Defense Department inspector general, who is now investigating “whether there was any falsification, distortion, delay, suppression, or improper modification of intelligence information” by the senior officials that run CENTCOM’s intelligence group. This second set of accusations, which have not been previously reported, were made to the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI). They show that the officials charged with overseeing all U.S. intelligence activities were aware, through their own channels, of potential problems with the integrity of information onISIS, some of which made its way to President Obama. The analysts have said that they believe their reports were altered for political reasons, namely to adhere to Obama administration officials’ public statements that the U.S.-led campaign against ISIS is making progress and has put a dent in the group’s financing and operations. Administration officials have denied that the intelligence reports came under political pressure. But Republican lawmakers and presidential candidates have questioned whether the public is being given an honest account of what effect hundreds of U.S. airstrikes have had on ISIS. The allegations of skewed intelligence have come up in several congressional hearings and figured in an early Republican presidential debate. The analysts made their claims to the ODNI in response to written surveys that were sent out by its Analytic Integrity and Standards Group last year, as part of a “periodic assessment” to take the pulse of the intelligence community, according to U.S. officials. Director of National Intelligence James Clapper was asked about the defense inspector general investigation in September during a congressional oversight hearing. At the time, he gave no indication that his own office was aware through its own channels of the analysts’ accusations. “It is an almost sacred writ… in the intelligence profession never to politicize intelligence. I don’t engage in it. I never have and I don’t condone it when it’s identified,” Clapper told the Senate Armed Services Committee. But Clapper sought to downplay what he called “media hyperbole” about the substance of the analysts’ complaints. “I think it’s best that we all await the outcome of the DOD I.G. investigation to determine whether and to what extent there was any politicization of intelligence at CENTCOM,” Clapper said. A spokesperson for the defense inspector general declined to comment for this story. In the survey from the ODNI, the analysts accused their superiors of editing or rejecting reports that cast doubt on whether the U.S.-led campaign against ISIS was dealing a crippling blow, and they accused senior CENTCOM intelligence officials of attempting to delete emails and other reports that provided evidence of their manipulations, according to a source familiar with the survey who spoke on condition of anonymity. CENTCOM said no emails were deleted. “It is important to allow the DoD IG investigation to run its course. However, I can tell you that neither Maj. Gen. Grove nor Mr Ryckman deleted any e-mails associated with the investigation. In fact, as a matter of CENTCOM policy, all senior leader e-mails are kept in storage for record keeping purposes. CENTCOM continues to cooperate fully with the DOD IG investigation,” Air Force Col. Patrick Ryder said in a statement to the Daily Beast. It’s not clear when the survey responses were reviewed by ODNI officials, but they were included in a report that was finished by December 2015. The ODNI chose not to investigate the claims of impropriety on its own because the Defense Department’s inspector general had already launched an investigation, sources familiar with the matter told The Daily Beast. That investigation, which hasn’t been completed, began after more than 50 CENTCOM analysts filed complaints with the Pentagon watchdog in July 2015. U.S. Central Command, based in Tampa, Florida, is responsible for U.S. military operations across the Middle East, from Egypt to Afghanistan. There are more than 1,000 analysts assigned to assessing intelligence and other data on the security situation of the region. They include troops and civilian intelligence analysts who work for the nation’s various intelligence agencies. The ODNI oversees all intelligence agencies, military and civilian, and is ultimately responsible for ensuring that intelligence reports are free from political influence and bias and that they’re based on sound, verifiable sources of information. The ODNI standards group was set up by law following the botched intelligence community analysis of Iraq’s weapons of mass destruction program in 2002 (PDF), which suppressed dissenting views that doubted Saddam Hussein had a viable chemical weapons program. That report, which has been effectively disavowed, was seized upon by senior Bush administration officials to make a public case for invading the country. The standards group “conducts regular periodic assessments of finished analytic products” and reviews them “for timeliness, objectivity and independence from political considerations, and ensures that the products are based upon all sources of available intelligence and employ the standards of proper analytic tradecraft,” Timothy Barrett, a spokesperson for the ODNI, told The Daily Beast in a written statement. “Intelligence analysis from CENTCOM was reviewed by [the group] in 2015 as a part of the periodic assessment, and the information is available to Congress and the [Defense Department inspector general],” Barrett said. It wasn’t clear whether the congressional committees that oversee intelligence activities had seen the comments from CENTCOM analysts. According to one source familiar with the document, it has been classified at the “secret” level and cannot be widely shared with lawmakers beyond the two intelligence committees. A task force composed of staff from three House committees—on intelligence, armed services, and appropriations—is investigating the analysts’ allegations and whether they reflect any systemic problems with intelligence analysis. It remains unclear whether the analysts’ complaints to the ODNI led to any corrective actions or halted what they saw as an inappropriate practice of selectively altering reports. Three sources who are familiar with the defense inspector general’s investigation told The Daily Beast that the watchdog had conducted interviews with analysts at CENTCOM’s headquarters in Tampa, and had reviewed documents allegedly showing that senior officials, including Maj. Gen. Steven Grove, the command’s intelligence director, and his civilian deputy, Gregory Ryckman, haddeleted emails and files from computer systemsbefore the inspector general could examine them. “The cancer was within the senior level of the intelligence command,” one defense official told The Daily Beast. The pushback by the analysts has been described as a “revolt.” One person who knows the contents of the written complaint they sent to the defense inspector general said it used the word “Stalinist” to describe the tone set by officials overseeing CENTCOM’s analysis. Two officials at CENTCOM told The Daily Beast they were not aware of the ODNI’s efforts or the survey that analysts had completed. They said the biggest changes to intelligence practices came in the days after analysts filed their complaint with the inspector general. Army Gen. Lloyd Austin, the commander of CENTCOM, urged analysts to speak up if they felt their assessments were being altered. In the wake of the allegations of politicizing intelligence, some of the people who receive CENTCOM reports told The Daily Beast that they read them more skeptically. But the reliability of CENTCOM’s analysis has only become more important since the accusations first emerged. In Afghanistan, the Taliban is resurgent and both ISIS and al Qaeda are trying to expand their footprint. In Iraq, U.S. and Iraqi forcespushed ISIS out of Ramadi, raising hopes that the two nations could launch a similar campaign in Iraq’s second-biggest city, Mosul, which serves as ISIS’s Iraqi capital. In Yemen, ISIS is weaker butal Qaeda is stronger. And in Syria, Russian strikes are helping forces loyal to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad reclaim territory in the city of Aleppo. Should that city fall squarely to the regime, Syria would devolve into a war largely between the regime and ISIS, leaving the Western world with no good outcomes for the fate of that state. Were that to happen, unvarnished analysis on ISIS and the state of the war would be more important than ever."
TheDailyBeast.com,http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/02/01/jason-silva-talks-psychedelics-biotech-and-brain-games.html," Jason Silva, host of National Geographic Channel’sBrain Games, talks the promises of psychedelics in neuroscience, the excitement of biotech, and more. National Geographic Channel’sBrain Gamesis back this season to continue dropping our jaws and answering our most perplexing questions with host Jason Silva at the reins. In case it’s not already in your TV repertoire, the Emmy®-nominated Brain Games takes viewers behind-the-scenes of our brains, showing the “wow” behind the “why” to help us make sense of the science. This season of Brain Games promises to be even more mind-bending and illusion-shattering than the last, delving into topics like the seven deadly sins, hidden senses, bad behavior, and more. Sounds complicated. But lucky for us, Silva presents an assortment of interactive games and experiments designed to reveal and explain the surprising inner workings of the brain. Silva strikes the perfect balance between philosophy and technology by weaving time-tested ideas with engaging new theories. This is precisely why he has the large following he does. Silva has dedicated his life to making people think differently about the human mind and evolution of mankind. Fortunately for Silva fans—or those who are simply curious about exploring their consciousness—Brain Games is returning onSunday, February 14 at 9/8c. The Daily Beast caught up with him to talk more about what viewers can expect next season, ayahuasca, and what’s on his 2016 reading list. If you could describe the next season of “Brain Games” in one word (for singularity’s sake), what would it be? And why? Season five in one word is IMMERSIVE. The show takes us deeper into specific brain topics than ever before. Previously, you’ve explored the mind’s imagination, perception, positive thinking, and much more. Can you give fans a preview of what you’ll be covering next season? And without giving too much away, explain why these subjects are important to you. In our episode called “The God Brain,” we explore the neuroscience of religious experience. We travel to Jerusalem and look at how our experiences of “the divine” can be mediated by scripture, architecture and psychedelics. Another episode, “Brains Behaving Badly,” takes us to New Orleans to look at the seven deadly sins and how they each play out in the brain. The point is that every episode takes us to a location that is related to the particular theme, making the show a deeper journey, more immersive than before. It’s awesome. What do you want viewers to gain from next season? The goal is for viewers to have a deeper understanding of how their brain “creates” the reality in which they live — the empowerment of realizing that they can change that reality. Now on to some personal questions: Describe a daily ritual. The morning is for analytical; the afternoon is for creative. I start with a morning workout, double espresso, emails until 1 p.m., and then an afternoon activity that induces divergent, associational thinking. Who influences you the most? I’m quite inspired by the founders of the Flow Genome Project, Jamie Wheal and Steven Kotler. They’ve reverse engineered the secret to ecstatic states — the psychology, pharmacology, technology, and neurobiology of flow. What is one problem you think all humans should be focused on solving together this year? I think, for one, we should upgrade politics. We need to focus on investing more heavily in creating software algorithms that solve real-world problems. Science, technology, philosophy — that’s where it’s at. What books are on your 2016 reading list? The Inevitableby Kevin Kelly andStealing Fireby Steven Kotler and Jamie Wheal. Recently, the first legal and public ayahuasca church found a home in the state of Washington. Do you think we’ll see more mainstream acceptance of people using psychedelics to help with a spiritual awakening in the near future? In my opinion, absolutely, yes. I believe this is probably some of the most exciting research going on right now in the field of psychotherapy. The work thatMAPS.orgis doing with MDMA and people with PTSD is amazing. We’re all afflicted with the human condition, we are all neurotic, we are all mortal. I think any tool that helps us recontextualize that situation is going to be very useful. Socrates is believed to have said that “the unexamined life is not worth living,” and psychedelics are amplifiers of human consciousness to be used carefully, creatively, and responsibly. Finally, is there one piece of technology that you think is underrated today? People don’t talk enough about the promise of biotechnology. It’s going to change our lives for the better in ways that are difficult to wrap our heads around. We are alphabetic beings all the way down — we are made of code and we can now manipulate that code. Catch the new season of Brain Games on Sunday, at 9/8c on the National Geographic Channel."
TheDailyBeast.com,http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/02/16/hillary-clinton-racism-behind-gop-push-to-block-obama-supreme-court-nominee.html,"Republican rhetoric against the president’s right to nominate the next Supreme Court justice is ‘in keeping with what we’ve heard all along,’ Clinton said Tuesday. Political Reporter Hillary Clinton broke out in a vicious coughing fit about two-thirds of the way through a speech she gave in Harlem on Tuesday. As she struggled to get it under control, first with water and then eventually a cough drop, Clinton riffed, “Too much to say,” as the crowded auditorium at the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture cheered her on. Clinton, speaking to an incredibly supportive audience in her home state, suggested that Republican opposition to President Obama’s plan to appoint a Supreme Court justice to take the late Antonin Scalia’s seat is predicated on the inherent racism that has made Obama the enemy for the past seven years of his administration. “Justice Scalia’s passing means the court hangs in the balance,” Clinton said. “Now the Republicans say they’ll reject anyone President Obama nominates, no matter how qualified. Some are even saying he doesn’t have the right to nominate anyone! As if somehow he’s not the real president. “That’s in keeping with what we’ve heard all along, isn’t it? Many Republicans talk in coded, racial language about takers and losers. They demonize President Obama and encourage the ugliest impulses of the paranoid fringe. This kind of hatred and bigotry has no place in our politics or our country.” Republicans in the Senate, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, have said theydo not want Obama to appoint a new justicein the last year of his term and would rather wait for the next president to do so. ""The American people‎ should have a voice in the selection of their next Supreme Court justice. Therefore, this vacancy should not be filled until we have a new President,"" McConell said on Saturday, the day Scaliadied. Republican resistance, of course, stems from the fear that Obama will appoint a liberal justice to replace the conservative stalwart that was Scalia. As for whether that fear is also predicated on racial bias remains to be seen. When asked by The Daily Beast about Clinton’s comment, Attorney General Eric Holder, who was in attendance at her Harlem speech, hesitated to blame Republican opposition on bigotry alone. “Well, I think there’s a concern that President Obama will select somebody who...shares his worldview,” said Holder, who laughed at the suggestion that he could be picked for the court. “A progressive who is going to vote in certain ways. He is the elected president of the United States, and there’s a constitutional responsibility to appoint justices to the Supreme Court as vacancies occur. I see no compelling argument that is made to the contrary.” As for Bernie Sanders’s record on legislation benefiting the African-American community, Holder called the senator’s vote against the 1994 Brady Bill an “appalling lack of judgment” and said Clinton clearly has a better record on issues that matter to black voters. Clinton had quite a bit to say Tuesday about her primary opponent and the Johnny-come-lately persona Clinton’s African-American surrogates have cultivated for him. “You know, you can’t just show up at election time and say the right things and think that’s enough,” she said. “We can’t start building relationships a few weeks before a vote.” That line directly echoed what South Carolina House Minority Leader Todd Rutherford had to say about Sanderslast week, suggesting he had only come around to issues relevant to the African-American populace in the last “40 days,” while Clinton had been focused on them for the last “40 years.” Clinton’s speech, which addressed a multitude of specific issues, including the sentencing discrepancies between those in possession of cocaine and crack, and a plan to invest $2 billion in school districts to reform discipline practices, comes at a crucial time in her campaign. After barely eking out a win in Iowa and losing badly in the New Hampshire primary, the former secretary of state is hoping to rebound with a strong showing in Nevada and South Carolina, the latter of which she is expected to win big. But as the speech, with all its references to Flint and jabs at Sanders, indicates, Clinton is going to have to rely on African-American voters to capitalize on the next contests. She currently holds a 65-28 lead among black voters in South Carolina, according to apollreleased by CNN on Tuesday. Prior to Tuesday’s speech, Clintonmetwith Rev. Al Sharpton and members of the National Urban League. Still, by day’s end, she had not earned the endorsement of Sharpton, who met with Sanders before Clinton. “I have not decided who I will support for president, but I’m committed to making sure that our agenda remains front and center,” Sharpton told reporters on Tuesday. It’s unclear whether his support would boost Clinton, who has more immediate name recognition in the African-American community than Sanders does. But as the support of black voters becomes crucial to both Democratic candidates, Clinton seems to be more confident, repeating a new line added to her stump speech about not being a “single issue candidate.” “We have to begin by facing up to the reality of systemic racism, because these are not only problems of economic inequality,” Clinton said, referring to Sanders’s most repeated line. “These are problems of racial inequality.”"
Mic.com,http://mic.com/articles/128677/these-recycled-pcs-are-giving-kids-access-to-education-in-a-whole-new-way#.XSJNT9rPn,"Two years ago, a Minneapolis social worker named Gwendolene decided that her daughter would not be able to fulfill her dream of going to college until they had a computer for her to use at home. Gwendolene, a single mother, spent her days helping local residents with housing, financesÂ and access to technology, but when she went home at night, she felt the strain of making ends meet for herself and her daughter, Tequila.PCs for Peopleunderstood how she felt. ""Computers have become an extremely integral part of our everyday life,"" Madeline Tate, office manager for PCs for People, toldÂMic. ""Attempting to apply for a job or complete schoolwork without access to a computer is pretty near impossible."" According to the 2013 census, 78.5% of Americans have a computer in their homes. For those who don't, life can be tough, and local nonprofits like PCs for People are a way to plug that gap. Because of the rapid technological advances that happen with each new generation of PC, most businesses swap out their computers every three years, after which the PCs are often sent to a recycler and broken down for parts. ""A computer still has a lot of life left in it at that point and can provide a huge impact in the lives of families who, without our organization, would not have this opportunity,"" Tate said. Gwendolene got her computer from PCs for People; she was backÂ two years laterÂ to secure a laptop for her daughter, who was about to start college. ""I really needed [a laptop] for taking notes in class,"" Tequila told PCs for People, ""doing research, writing papers."" ""She's doing it for all of us,"" Gwendolene said. ""If she achieves ... her little brother has someone to look up to."" Tequila got the computer she was hoping for, a PC laptop, and went away happy. She'sÂ just one of thesuccess storiesÂ collected by PCs for People. The organization has been distributing donated computers throughout Minnesota since 1998, and it understands that a PC can be a powerful instrument of change. They are one of the dozens of nonprofits across the country that accept donated PCs and distribute them to people in need, ensuring that every American has access to digital technology. The nonprofit workersÂMicÂspoke with described PCs as easy to use and easy to customize, making them perfect for this kind of recycling. A securely wiped, refurbished PC is a blank canvas, waiting for someone like Gwendolene or her daughter to come along and use it to express themselves. ""PCs are able to be refurbished readily, and are a practical inexpensive solution for many families,"" Nancy Jo Craig of theÂCapital Area Corporate Recycling Council, based in Louisiana, toldMic. Her organization distributes electronic equipment across Louisiana. Like PCs for People, theÂ Capital Area Corporate Recycling CouncilÂ is a regional nonprofit deeplyÂ rooted in its local community â a sign that this kind of recycling effort is best accomplished by people who understand their neighbors' needs. ""Although many children have computers at school available to them, too many do not have home computers,"" Craig said. ""This means a trip to the library to complete assignments. Many families do not have transportation in the evenings, so these children fall behind."" According toÂ a 2011 survey byChild Trends, while 97% of children whose parents make more than $75,000 a year have a computer at home, that number falls to 66% for families making less than $20,000. PCs are essential for life in the digital age, and it will be hard to close that achievement gap without one. That's a phenomenon that John German noticed as early as 1984 when he foundedÂNonprofit Computing, a member of the United Nations Global Compact that arranges donations of computers in the United States and worldwide. ""Being able to use information and communication technologies is fundamental to life, work, citizenshipÂ and social relations â pretty much every aspect of modern life â and people expect that everyone uses them,"" German toldÂMic. ""Just try telling someone you don't have email or a mobile phone."" Some people don't upgrade their PCs because they don't know what to do with their used models. While many people may want to donate their slightly worn PC, they might not know where to do so. That's where Nonprofit Computing and similar organizations come in. It's as simple as finding an organization in your city and dropping off the computer, either at their office or a pre-arranged drop-off site like a school or office supply store. They wipe the computer according to federal guidelines and prepare the PC for its next owner. ""Computers are widely available for donation,"" German said. ""Organizations that need computers are pretty much everywhere, but generally they don't know each other, so matching up what donors have with what organizations need is a vitally important function, which we provide.""  Founded in New York City, Nonprofit Computing has strong ties to the local community, supporting organizations like the Harlem Restoration Project, whose students earn free computers by completing coursework. But they also arrange donations to people in need around the globe, delivering shipping containers packed with PCs to worthy groups such as an organization in Zambia dedicated to women's empowerment. ""It has been said that tools are amplifiers,"" German said. ""Whatever you want to do, the right tools can help you do it faster, better, less expensively â and that the computer is the greatest tool ever invented. And it's only going to get more powerful, more versatile, more useful."" Support those in need and upgrade your PC today."
Mic.com,http://mic.com/articles/127099/the-history-of-one-of-the-most-popular-games-minecraft#.yYgSsofZ9,"When you enter the world ofMinecraft, you're entering a digital world bigger than the Earth's surface. The game's appeal lies in a simple set of premises: Log in, enter a world composed entirely of 3-D cubes, then use a pickaxe and other tools to collect or manipulate these blocks. You can either play in creative or survival mode. Tens of millions of players have reconstructedNeuschwanstein Castle, devised elaborate dungeons and puzzles and waged war against legions of skeletons in ways that reach a level of artistry. This quirky game became a hit for a few key reasons that have everything to do with unlocking the creativity of the players involved. ""The freedom the game setting allowed for in terms of difficulty and variability of world interaction interspersed with the variability of landscape and climate were incredibly well-balanced,"" five-yearMinecraftplayer T.J. Checco toldMic.Â Minecraftwas never meant to be a hit. In 2009, Swedish game developerMarkus ""Notch"" Alexej Perssonrealized that a simple (but dynamic) game could have incredible potential. He began to release versions of what was then called ""the cave."" The game wasn't a pop culture success and tended to attract players with background knowledge in programming and computers. Since then, it's been re-released asMinecraftand sold over70 million copies, more copies than any other PC game in history. Gamer and engineer Aaron Goers, 26, said he started playing Minecraft five years ago, right before it went into beta.Â Goers, who works as a technology coordinator at Speed Stacks Inc., has been playing PC games for over 15 years and has logged more thanÂ 500 hours onMinecraft. ""Aside from the very early additions to the game, I've watched the whole thing evolve as I played,"" he said. ""As far as big software changes, the largest and likely most underappreciated was their change to what they called the Anvil database system."" It made a big world more efficient. TheAnvildatabase system, introduced in 2012, included anÂ overhaul of how data was processed and uploaded, making the Minecraft worlds much bigger and faster than before. According to one user'scalculation, oneMinecraftworld is eight times the Earth's surface area, which was a critical change as more and more players got onboard. With the database and mechanics streamlined and a wealth of players with high-end PCs prepped for hosting servers,ÂMinecraft'sgreatest innovation took off.Â Users began creating modifications and sharing them with other players. The cross-compatibility between machines allowed players on a range of PCs to take part in this process. The various online social platforms gave players a variety of ways to share the bounty. They could watch instructive videos on YouTube or Twitch, discuss their tinkerings on forums, Reddit and Facebook and formalize their knowledge in the immenseÂMinecraft Wiki. Like many other gamers, Goers has long enjoyed being able to customize his own PC to enhance his experience. He's built five computers so far and loves the freedom he has to pick and choose what goes into his PC in a modular way.Â Goers saidÂMinecraftÂ became popular because it accommodates people who are using different kinds of hardware. The game's simplicity means an amateur can play it on an inexpensive console, but gamers with better machines can get into activities like designing complicated mods and hosting their own servers. ""Being able to customize a computer to that level is a lot of fun, and it's especially useful for gaming,"" Goers said. ""PC is the only way to play.""  Today, there are oftenover 1 million active usersplayingMinecraftat any given time. The mod forum on Minecraftforum.net is by far the most popular, with over 4 million posts ranging from easy tweaks like new tools or ways to craft swordsÂ to aesthetic ones like jack-o'-lanterns for HalloweenÂ to elaborate scenarios within the game itself. While the creators of the mods need to have significant knowledge and experience with programming, the entire community can enjoy them. The latest addition to theMinecraftuniverse is the introduction of a ""Story Mode"" version of the game. Released byTelltale Gamesin association with the original studio Mojang, it allows players to engage in a narrative structure.Story Modeis split into episodes that last for two to three hours, and new episodes will be released periodically until 2016. This version creates a full story for players to exist in, allowing them to get creative within a set story in a way that has never existed before inMinecraft.Â TheWashington Post's Michael ThomsenÂsaid the gameÂ ""uses the mimetic architecture of storytelling to produce nodes of contemplation and self-inquiry. It's a subtle and sweet work made with an awareness that the best part of a journey comes when you realize you are in a story.""Â This version is not the new and only way of playingMinecraft. Rather, it's another outgrowth from an incredibly fertile ground that shows no signs of weakening. Minecraft's power lies in its ability to be flexible and compatible and to let users be creative."

It takes time, commitment and focus. With so much to do, plan and conquer it's easy to get distracted. We rounded up personal tips and tricks to staying productive and focused from some of the most exciting tech entrepreneurs. While some might recommend particular software or organizational methods to stay on track, others approach productivity in a more global way. But one thing that many of these entrepreneurs have in common is that each of their dreams, to some degree, came to fruition due to their own personal style of productivity. Take a page from their books, and with a little luck, you'll be helping to build empires in short order. Elon Musk, founder ofSpaceXandTesla Motors, can't quite manage to add more hours to the day â yet. Instead, hetreats multitaskinglike a rocket science, conducting business on his phone during precious family time andemailing so oftenthat he jokingly considers it his ""core competency."" No surprise, then, that Musk and those who help manage his tightly packed schedule treat his inbox as though it's buried deep inside Fort Knox, according to aQuora poston the subject. Only a lucky few know his current email address. At 14 years old, Shubham Banerjee is one of the world's youngest entrepreneurs. He is the inventor ofÂBraigoÂ (Braille + Lego), a cost-effective braille printer. MicrosoftÂ took notice. Banerjee worked with the company to build the next iteration of his original braille printer on a Windows operating system. This was a big step up from the Lego set he used to build his own starting version in 2013. His accomplishment is helping those who can't see have access to a smarter and better Braille printer. For Banerjee, creating something with technology that has abigger purposehelps him stay focused, according toU.S. News and World Report. Ingrid Vanderveldt is the CEO and founder of theEmpowering a Billion Women by 2020movement. The group, formally launched in 2015, isÂfocused aroundthree key pillars: mobility, mentoring and money. The goal of the organization is to give women the tools and community they need to become successful entrepreneurs, no matter where they live. Vanderveldt told theNext WomenÂ her ability toÂstay focusedby leaning on her support network and remembering the end goal of her project helps her accomplish challenging tasks. Dan Hubert is the CEO and co-founder ofAppyParking, which leverages big data to tell people (and eventually automated cars) where they can legally park their ride. Hubert was in advertising until he tried to attend a show at Royal Albert Hall in London in 2012 and had a hassle figuring out the parking rules around the venue. So, he set aboutdigitizing maps and compiling PDFsthat contain parking rules for areas of London, and AppyParking was born. Earlier this year, the company announced apartnership with Fordto help bring ""painless parking"" to the masses. While a lot of people spend time searching for and switching between various systems and apps to keep track of all their work, Hubert toldMicthat he uses just one flexible system, makes it work for him and gets on with the work. Nick D'Aloisio is a bit of a teenage wonder. He developed Summly, later bought by Yahoo, when he was 17 years old, but it wasn't a first-inning home run. He got started long before that, developing one appafter another, carefully learning from them each time. One of D'Aloisio's keys is never wanting to, or settling for, just coasting by, he told theFinancial Times. Instead, he continues to push himself by creating personal challenges to build new apps for new purposes. Jack Dorsey is most widely known as the co-founder (and recently named CEO) of Twitter. He's also the CEO ofSquare, a payment-processing company. In short, he pulls Elon Musk-level double duty. The way he keeps it all straight is by theming his days, according toForbes: Monday is for management and running the companies (both companies); Tuesday is all about the product; Wednesday is for marketing and growth; Thursday is for partnerships; Friday is company culture and recruiting; Saturday is time off, and Sunday is for reflection and strategy. For the rest of us, that might mean Monday is for meetings, Tuesday is for new business, etc. â but you get the drift. The more you can prioritize and organize your schedule by day during the week, the more productive you can be. Clara ShihÂ is the founder and CEO ofÂHearsay Social. The company, which started as an idea for an app from Shih, gives teams around the world the power to connect with customers and grow their businesses on social media channels. She urges young entrepreneurs ""to take more risks and to embrace every mistake they make,"" according toFortune. When starting her own company with a former Stanford classmate, Shihknew some risks were involved, but she took those challenges head on and is now a founder of a successful tech company. While starting something new or tackling a larger challenge can present us with risk and potential failure, it is only through these mistakes that we learn and grow. Failure often just creates information for how to learn to do better in the future. Shih uses this belief in learning and collecting data from missteps to be more productive in her everyday life and career, she toldFortune. Whether it's particular productivity hacks or larger vision-oriented approaches to getting things done, take a few words of wisdom from those who've been there before to sort through the clutter and make your own impact."
NJ.com,http://www.nj.com/njcancercare_rcca/2015/10/breast_cancer_in_sussex_county.html#incart_river_index,"The oncologists of RCCA emphasize that women can protect their breast health and overall well-being by seeing their health care provider regularly for preventive care and having mammograms in keeping with the guidelines applicable to their age and medical history. The rate at which new cases of breast cancer are being diagnosed in Sussex County is stable, while the county's breast-cancer death rate is falling, according to the National Cancer Institute (NCI) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). As National Breast Cancer Awareness Month is observed in the area and across the country, the oncologists ofRegional Cancer Care Associates, or RCCA, in Sparta want to provide area residents with background on those encouraging trends and important information on protecting and promoting breast health. May Abdo-Matkiwsky, DO The NCI and CDC report that an average 121 county residents were diagnosed with breast cancer each year from 2008 to 2012, the last period for which data are available.1The annual rate at which new cases were diagnosed held steady during that period, at roughly 132 people per 100,000.1Meanwhile, the rate of death from breast cancer in Sussex County fell by approximately 1.9 percent each year during that period, to 24.2 per 100,000 people, according to the NCI and CDC.2This translates into 22 women dying of breast cancer each year, on average, from 2008 through 2012.2Both the stable rate of new cases and falling death rate are in line with statewide and national trends. Dr. May Abdo-Matkiwsky,Dr. Bohdan HalibeyandDr. Jumana Chatiwalanote that while these trends are welcome, and that the declining death rate reflects the significant progress that has been made in treating breast cancer in recent years, there is still a long way to go in terms of prevention, early diagnosis, and therapy. One of the first steps in that process, they add, is for women to be aware of factors that may increase or reduce breast cancer risk, and to work to change those factors that can be modified. Bohdan E. Halibey, MD According to the American Cancer Society (ACS), lifestyle or behavioral factors that affect a woman's risk of breast cancer include:3 Meanwhile, RCCA oncologists note, women also should be aware of the other factors that can increase their risk for breast cancer but that are beyond their control. According to the ACS, these non-modifiable risk factors include:3 The oncologists ofRCCAemphasize that in addition to working to change those risk factors that can be modified, women can protect their breast health and overall well-being by seeing their health care provider regularly for preventive care and having mammograms in keeping with the guidelines applicable to their age and medical history.

NJ.com,http://www.nj.com/njcancercare_rcca/2016/01/valerie_freeman_and_rccas_dr_s.html#incart_river_index,"Valerie Freeman is accustomed to being the one who cares for and encourages others, but after being diagnosed with triple-negative breast cancer in December 2010, she found herself on the receiving end of both life-saving care and tough-love encouragement from a kindred soul. ""I've come to love Dr. Waintraub because he cares about me as though I were someone in his own family. He never sugar-coats anything. He always keeps it real, but his compassion is awesome. At our first meeting, he said, 'You're going to live through this. You have an aggressive cancer, and we're going to be aggressive in treating it, but you're going to get through this,"" Freeman, 49, says ofStanley Waintraub, MD, FACP, co-chief of breast oncology at theJohn Theurer Cancer Center at Hackensack University Medical Centerand a member ofRegional Cancer Care Associates(RCCA). Stanley Waintraub, MD, FACP, co-chief of breast oncology at the John Theurer Cancer Center at Hackensack University Medical Center and a member of Regional Cancer Care Associates (RCCA). As a mentor to young women in her hometown of Paterson, Freeman regularly listens to others recount their problems or challenges before offering advice and support that, while sympathetic, is also straightforward. In facing the biggest challenge of her life, she valued her physician taking the same approach. ""At every visit I had with Dr. Waintraub, he always made me feel that I could handle it, that I could get through it,"" she said of her six-month chemotherapy regimen. ""He could be stern, but he was always compassionate. No question was a dumb question. He explained everything - he even drew on a white board to outline things."" Freeman's battle with cancer began in the summer of 2010, when she noticed a lump in her right breast. At the time, she was busy caring for her mother, who was terminally ill with lung cancer, so she deferred seeking care. At her mother's urging, she eventually had the lump evaluated, and the initial findings were negative. Following her mother's death in October 2010, however, Freeman had follow-up tests that resulted in her receiving a diagnosis of breast cancer on Dec. 29, 2010. After undergoing lumpectomy at another area hospital, Freeman turned to the John Theurer Cancer Center (JTCC) because she had been very impressed with the way that the RCCA doctors, the nurses, and others there had cared for her mother. Further, she adds that in battling tripe-negative breast cancer, she wanted access to the medical expertise, comprehensive services, and wide-ranging clinical trials offered by JTCC and RCCA, one of the largest oncology physician networks in the United States. The form of breast cancer that Freeman had is called ""triple negative"" because the cancerous cells do not express genes for estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR) or Her2/neu, targets of the chemotherapies commonly used to treat breast cancer. This lack of receptors that respond to standard chemotherapy regimens makes the cancer particularly difficult to treat, and often requires the use of combinations of chemotherapies. Triple-negative breast cancer, or TNBC, affects African-American women and Hispanic women at a much higher rate than white and Asian women, and during her treatment at JTCC, Freeman entered a clinical trial evaluating new therapeutic approaches to TNBC in African-American women. While Freeman said that her chemotherapy course was marked by side effects and often grueling, she credits Dr. Waintraub and the nurses, social workers, nutritionists, and others at JTCC with providing care that was as compassionate as it was comprehensive. ""They're amazing,"" she says of the nurses and other team members. ""They didn't make me feel like a patient. They knewme- Val. They knew my likes and dislikes. When I go for follow-up visits, I still get a sick feeling in my stomach when I'm outside the center, because it brings back memories of everything I had to go through, but that goes away the minute I'm inside and seeing all the people who know me and took care of me."" Today, a little over five years after receiving her diagnosis of TNBC, Freeman remains in remission, and recently moved from a three-month follow-up schedule to a six-month schedule. She is making the most of her good health by enjoying her family and giving back to the community. In addition to mentoring young women, she serves as secretary of Paterson Cares, an organization that feeds the homeless, and is involved in other efforts to enhance the quality of life in Paterson. She also shares her experience with other women. ""You have to tell your story because you never know who that story will touch,"" she adds. ""I tell people not to view a diagnosis of cancer as a death sentence. That's what you think automatically when you get the news, but it's not necessarily the case any longer. With today's medicine and technology and the different approaches they can use, there is a lot of reason for hope. And while going through treatment can be tough, it's not as bad as you think."" Dr. Waintraub, who treated Freeman, is a board-certified medical oncologist and hematologist specializing in breast cancer care and research. He received a medical degree from New York Medical College and completed his residency at Metropolitan Hospital Center in New York City before going on to fellowships at Montefiore Medical Center and Memorial Sloan-Kettering Medical Center. He has treated patients in northern New Jersey for more than 30 years. Dr. Waintraub is one of more than 100 cancer care specialists in RCCA, an oncology physician network dedicated to transforming oncology care by ensuring that cancer patients have access to the highest-quality, most-comprehensive, cutting-edge treatments in a compassionate and community-based setting. RCCA's cancer care specialists are supported by 700 employees at 30 care delivery sites, providing care to more than 23,000 new patients annually and more than 240,000 existing patients.

NJ.com,http://www.nj.com/njcancercare_rcca/2015/11/facing_cancer_a_veteran_educat.html#incart_river_index,"Vincent Stasio received the help he needed at the Freehold Division of Regional Cancer Care Associates. Has an unexpected problem on an already tough day ever prompted you to say, ""Great -- just what I needed""? That was Vincent Stasio's reaction when a flat tire delayed his delivery of food to a party he was catering one spring day in 2011. Four years later, the Manasquan resident says that in retrospect, his late arrival at the event was, indeed, exactly what he needed. A veteran educator and coach who did some occasional catering, Stasio had recently undergone tests that indicated he had colon cancer, which had spread to his right lung. By the time he changed the tire and got to the party, the festivities were under way, and his host insisted that he stay and socialize with the guests, many of whom he knew. A friend approached Stasio to say that she had heard his news, adding that she worked for a radiologist and would be happy to help him obtain a second opinion if he wished. Stasio took her up on the offer, and when the radiologist had questions about what he saw on the imaging studies, he consulted Bhavesh Balar, MD, a medical oncologist and hematologist with the Freehold Division ofRegional Cancer Care Associates (RCCA), one of the largest oncology physician networks in the United States. Bhavesh Balar, MD ""By the grace of God I got connected with Dr. Balar,"" Stasio said, explaining that when the oncologist did not agree with the initial findings, Dr. Balar undertook his own in-depth assessment and consulted another expert at Johns Hopkins Medicine. It was determined that the cancer originated in the lung, not the colon, which had important ramifications for Stasio's treatment. In June 2011, Stasio underwent minimally invasive video-assisted thoracic surgery at CentraState Medical Center in Freehold, where Dr. Balar serves as chairman of the Cancer Committee. Dr. Balar has continued to care for Stasio in the intervening years, managing cancerous cells found on the liver later in 2011 and in the abdomen in 2014. With his treatments for the latter completed in June 2015 and imaging studies showing no problems, Stasio is focused on his role as vice principal of an Asbury Park elementary school. Some of the most important lessons he has to share, however, are not for school children but rather for others confronting a diagnosis of cancer. ""I know it's easier said than done, but it's important to not overreact when you're first dealing with that news. Step back and think about which approach is best. Take a deep breath, and talk with people you know and trust. Don't be afraid to get a second opinion, because it's crucial that you get the right diagnosis, the right treatment, and the right doctor,"" Stasio said. ""I have nothing but great things to say about Dr. Balar,"" he said. ""He is incredibly conscientious and always open to dialogue. He truly has the best interests of his patients in mind."" Dr. Balar has comparable praise for his patient. ""Mr. Stasio has been a very pro-active, highly informed partner in his care, which I welcome and which makes for a very effective patient-physician alliance,"" said the board-certified medical oncologist and hematologist. Dr. Balar, who has been treating patients in the Freehold area for more than seven years, received his medical degree magna cum laude from the University of South Florida College of Medicine in Tampa. He also completed his internal medicine residency at the University of South Florida, and completed his fellowship in medical oncology and hematology at the university-affiliated H. Lee Moffitt Cancer Center and Research Institute in Tampa. Dr. Balar is on the medical staff of CentraState Medical Center, Bayshore Community Hospital in Holmdel and Riverview Medical Center in Red Bank. Dr. Balar is one of more than 100 RCCA cancer specialists providing the highest-quality and most-comprehensive cutting-edge treatments in a compassionate and community-based setting at 30 locations in New Jersey, Maryland and Washington D.C.

Volunteers from the Metro-West Steelheaders, the Clinton River Watershed Council and the Michigan United Conservation Club On the Ground program participated in a July 16 cleanup of the Clinton River.(Photo: Courtesy of The Michigan Wildlife Council) For some participants in a July 16 cleanup of the Clinton River in Oakland County, the main goal was to help boost fish populations. Others wanted a cleaner river to enjoy for activities such as canoeing or kayaking. Whatever their motivations, the cleanup left all groups satisfied and, organizers said, served as another example of outdoor lovers of all kinds coming together to preserve the state’s natural resources. “Essentially, it’s for the preservation and the overall benefit of the river,” said Adam Trenz, who organized theMetro-West Steelheadersparticipation in the effort. “Without someone stepping up and doing it, what would the river look like?” Joining members of the Steelheaders in the cleanup were volunteers from theClinton River Watershed Counciland theMichigan United Conservation ClubsOn the Ground program. During the three hours the 15 volunteers spent cleaning a 2-mile stretch of the Clinton River at Yates Park in Rochester Hills, they removed more than 200 pounds of trash, including items such as a tire, a large metal grate, a bucket of paint, many bottles and cans, plastic and the occasional shoe. At the previous two of what has become an annual cleanup, the groups picked a total of 700 pounds of trash from the water. “Beyond the science-based management of our forests, waters and wildlife performed by state and federal agencies, these types of volunteer-led efforts are essential to preserving Michigan’s outdoor heritage for future generations,” said Henry Stancato of the Michigan Wildlife Council. A volunteer during a July 16 cleanup of the Clinton River near Rochester Hills wades in the water searching for trash.(Photo: Courtesy of The Michigan Wildlife Council) Complementing the DNR Indeed, Sarah Topp, the Michigan United Conservation Club’s wildlife volunteer coordinator, said the On the Ground program – which she oversees – was created to undertake projects that Michigan Department of Natural Resources staffers otherwise lacked the time or resources to handle. Launched in 2013, the program draws from a roster of 350 volunteers who complete a couple dozen conservation projects throughout the state every year. The On the Ground program is funded in the form of a DNR Wildlife Habitat Grant through a portion of hunting and fishing licenses sold each year. For instance, among other endeavors, On the Ground volunteers so far this year have also planted trees to create elk habitat in the Pigeon River Country State Forest and cut black locust trees in the Rose Lake State Wildlife Area northeast of Lansing to make homes – known as “rabbitat” – for small game animals. On the Ground focuses on projects that improve habitat for game species and sport fish on lands open to the public for hunting and fishing. For example, the underlying reason for the Clinton River cleanup was to remove barriers to fish spawning sites, Topp noted. On the Ground projects also serve to show the general public that those who hunt and fish are “true conservationists,” the program’s website states. That’s a message that resonates with many volunteers with varied outdoor interests, Topp said. “We get a lot of volunteers who don’t hunt or fish but they like to bird-watch, for example,” she said. “Everyone understands that what we do creates opportunity for seeing wildlife.” The Metro-West Steelheaders have a similar philosophy regarding their community involvement, Trenz said. “It’s all about leaving it for the future,” he said. “It’s not always about harvesting. I probably release 90 percent of the fish I catch each year. It’s about having access to resources.” While most individual conservation projects performed by volunteers are relatively small in scale, cumulatively they serve as an important complement to the DNR and other agency professional management of Michigan’s outdoor resources, Topp said. “Sometimes, Mother Nature needs an assist,” she said. “I wish more people took time to understand the benefits of various types of management techniques.” Topp said volunteers are welcome to join other On the Ground projects slated for this summer, including: More than 200 pounds of trash was removed from a 2-mile stretch of the Clinton River at Yates Park in Rochester Hills on July 16.(Photo: Courtesy of The Michigan Wildlife Council) For more information on MUCC’s On the Ground program, go towww.mucc.org/ontheground.

Today, cardiovascular treatments have changed, with more of a focus on minimally invasive procedures.(Photo: megaflopp, Getty Images/iStockphoto) In the not-so-distant past, patients suffering from heart disease had a very different experience than patients do today. As recently as a couple decades ago, heart attack patients were likely admitted to a hospital’s coronary care unit where doctors could monitor the patient but didn’t have a lot of options when it came to saving the heart muscle, according to Kirit Patel, M.D., medical director of the cardiac catheterization lab and chief of division of cardiology at St. Joseph Mercy Oakland. “Twenty-five to 30 years ago there were no stents available and we didn’t even know to give aspirin to heart attack patients,” Patel says. “Now, patients have angioplasty or stents and go home the next day. That’s how fast technology has moved.” Today – although angioplasty, stents and other artery-opening procedures are still widely used – cardiovascular treatment has changed, with more of a focus on advanced minimally invasive procedures that have transformed heart disease from a possible death sentence to a treatable condition that patients live with for years. “[In the past,] treatment was driven by coronary artery blockages. Emergency procedures, angiograms, stents and open-heart surgery were 85 percent of what we did,” says William W. O’Neill, M.D., medical director of the Center for Structural Heart Disease at the Henry Ford Heart and Vascular Institute. “The good news is the epidemic is abating and we are seeing fewer heart attacks. We have patients now with coronary artery disease who are relatively stable.” That means doctors are treating older patients – even in their 90s – and seeing conditions that used to be somewhat rare become more prominent. “We are seeing more patients with atrial fibrillation, a condition that one-third of those over the age of 80 have,” O’Neill says. “There’s also more valvular disease because as we age, our valves wear out. There used to be a lot of open-heart surgeries, but now there are a wide variety of ways to fix the heart without open-heart surgery. That’s where it’s at now.” Reinventing Heart Health Those in the medical profession expect research and technology will continue to move at a rapid pace, according to Tom Davis, M.D., medical director for cardiovascular research and the cardiac catheterization labs at St. John Hospital and Medical Center. “We are reinventing ourselves every five years,” Davis says. “Everything I do today is completely different than when I started in 1993.” Davis says he expects to see a continued push to minimally invasive strategies to treat heart patients. “I expect soon we will see more heart surgeries done in an outpatient setting,” he says. “There will be shorter procedures and the patient will go home the same day.” O’Neill says regenerating heart muscles with stem cell therapy and tissue engineering, where parts such as valves will be individually made using 3D models, are also on the horizon. “This is not science fiction or something that is light years away,” he says. “It’s very realistic that we will see these procedures 10 years from now.” A new class of LDL-cholesterol-lowering drugs called PCSK9 inhibitors, which don’t have the side effects of statins, will also be a game-changer, O’Neill says. Though the injectable drug is quite expensive – about $14,000 for a one-year supply – and only currently FDA-approved for those with familial hypercholesterolemia, a genetic condition that causes up to three times the normal level of LDL cholesterol, and certain patients who require more lowering of LDL than they are getting with statins, O’Neill says he expects all that to change in the near future. “These drugs can dramatically lower cholesterol,” he says. “If there is widespread use, we will see coronary artery disease disappear from society.” Looking Ahead Exciting news?

Picking up a new hobby like gardening can actually build up a reserve of brainpower that lasts for years.(Photo: Shutterstock) Everyone has the occasional “senior moment.” Maybe you wander to the kitchen and can’t remember why, or you misplace your keys. But while these mental hiccups may be bothersome, they usually don’t drive you to visit the doctor. Most people focus on physical problems – high blood pressure, pain, disability – but if your mental health isn’t functioning optimally, your physical health will suffer as well. The good news: Studies show you can bolster your brain’s reserves and reduce your risk of losing your mind by adopting some basic health habits. Already in your golden years? Don’t fret. Research also shows the brain continues forming new connections throughout our lifespans. And you can help it along with these eight brain-boosting strategies: 1. Learn a foreign language. Learning a second (or a third) language challenges the brain in new ways and may even delay the onset of dementia, according to recent research. Say you learn the word for mother in Spanish is “madre.” Initially, you may have to concentrate to remember that word, but if you practice, over time, it becomes part of your vocabulary. That easy recall proves your brain has laid down a new pathway. Quick tip:Pick one night a week to speak in another language (however poorly), or stay silent and communicate with sign language. 2. Try a new activity. Engaging in mentally challenging activities helps build a reserve of brainpower you can draw on for years. The key, of course, is choosing unfamiliar activities that you enjoy. Play chess, take up gardening or learn to play a musical instrument. It doesn’t matter what you choose, provided the activity is new to you. Quick tip:If you’re a whiz at crossword puzzles, do a word search activity instead. Comfortable with writing exercises? Try your hand at drawing or painting. 3. Eatbrain-boosting foods. Eating a diet rich in fruits, vegetables and whole grains, and low in saturated fat and sugar, can help protect brain networks. In fact, studies consistently show that eating a mix of nourishing foods—fruits, vegetables, nuts, fatty fish, and yes, even a daily glass of wine—sharpens your mind, builds new brain cells and fights off mental decline. Quick tip:Keep a stash of trail mix in your pocketbook or glove box. The brain needs consistent fuel (at least every 3 to 5 hours) to function well. 4. Exercise. Research consistently linksphysical exercisewith brain benefits, particularly in the regions responsible for learning and memory. But don’t worry. You don’t have to spend 90 minutes in the gym to experience exercise’s mind-boosting effects. Even moderate exercise (say jogging, cycling or even walking) for about 30 minutes daily can get the blood flowing to your head. Quick Tip:Preliminary research suggests the perks of physical activity are more pronounced when combined with a mental challenge. So things like taking a dance class, learning martial arts or practicingyogamay be especially beneficial. Sleep clears out waste products from the brain and is one of the best things you can do to help your memory, says Rumana Yunus, M.D.(Photo: Henry Ford Health System) 5. Get some sleep. Gettingsufficient sleepis one of the best things you can do for your brain. While researchers aren’t entirely clear what happens in the mind when you’re snoozing, they do know that sleep is critical for the bodyandmind to function at their prime. Sleep not only reenergizes the body’s cells and clears out waste products from the brain, it also promotes learning and memory. Quick tip:Strive to get seven to eight hours of sleep each night. Can’t manage to sleep that many hours in one stretch? Consider a daytimepower nap. 6. Stay on top of your health conditions. Just as your mind can help protect your body, keeping your body humming can protect your mind. Health conditions ranging fromdiabetesandhigh blood pressuretodepressionandhypothyroidismcan impact how well your brain functions. Quick tip:Protect your memory by following your doctor’s advice carefully, taking medications appropriately and reporting any changes in how your brain is functioning. 7. Meditate. The brain needs time to restore itself and reflect. In fact, research links “thinking about not thinking” to a host of physical and mental health benefits. And emerging research suggestsmeditatingregularly may even enhance your memory. Quick tip:Take 10 to 15 minutes each day to quiet your mind and focus on only one thing: your breathing. Not only will you give your brain an opportunity to recharge, but the focused breaths will promote blood flow to it, too. 8. Connect. Maintaining close relationships requires a certain level of brainpower. Not only do you have to think fast to engage in conversation, but resolving conflicts and debating current affairs flexes mental muscles as well. So it’s no wonder studies suggest that socially active seniors are less likely to developAlzheimer’s diseasethan their wallflower counterparts. Quick tip:Develop friendships with people of different ages, races and ethnic backgrounds to increase the load on your brain. Processing differences in speech, tone, even the latest cultural lingo can challenge the brain to build new connections. Above all, the easiest way to keep your mind sharp as you age is to develop a meaningful life. The combination of a healthy lifestyle, work that motivates you and a sense of purpose goes a long way in terms of safeguarding the brain. If you notice a change in your memory, or if you find you’re struggling to think clearly, make an appointment to talk with your primary doctor or a specialist.

The news and editorial departments of The Boston Globe had no role in
its production or display. MOST POPULAR ON BOSTONGLOBE.COM Based on what you've read recently, you might be interested in these stories | February 2, 2016  Six years after the Affordable Care Act (ACA) became law, U.S. health care policy and the delivery of medical services continue to undergo unprecedented change. Rockland Trust’s “Talking Business Advice Series” spoke with John E. McDonough, professor of Public Health Policy at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, to get his take on what may lie ahead for businesses working with the ACA during this dynamic period. Q: You helped write the ACA. It’s an extremely complex law that even today is not fully understood by many Americans, including business owners and leaders. From a high-level perspective, where do things stand with it today? A:Most people understand that the ACA is moving us toward universal health coverage. For the United States, the ACA is a revolution, an enormous set of changes that many see as a huge step forward and many others see as a wrong turn. Globally, however, all of the world’s advanced nations prior to the ACA already had health care schemes that, to varying degrees, met the insurance needs of their populations. So, while the ACA’s insurance expansions and reforms represent a great leap forward for the U.S., it is also true that when fully implemented by 2018, the U.S. will still have the most inefficient, wasteful, and unfair health insurance system of any advanced nation, even with the ACA reforms. On the other hand, the ACA is also advancing an agenda of dramatic and necessary change in how medical care is delivered in the U.S. As a nation, we are now moving rapidly away from a financing system based on fee-for-service payments, (which is) a system that rewards hospitals, physicians, and other medical providers based on the quantity of services they provide without regard for the quality, effectiveness, and efficiency of those services. Because of the ACA, we are now moving quickly toward a new financing framework that rewards hospital, physicians, and providers based on the quality and value of the services they provide rather than the quantity. Q: The public doesn’t necessarily view it in this way, does it? A:You’re right. This change has gone unrecognized by the broad public, even as it moves forward in rapid and profound ways. A lot of what the ACA envisions is experimental. Some elements are working better than others; some continue to be fiercely debated. The U.S. doesn’t have all the answers in this effort, but we have the most dynamic set of experiments on this evolutionary path of any advanced nation on the planet right now. Health system leaders all around the world are very interested in this set of experiments and watching closely. That is something that corporate leaders, regardless of industry sector, ought to recognize, appreciate, and understand. Q: What are some of the effects of these experiments on businesses? A:The immediate effects of the ACA depend on the context of the business itself. For example, the ACA’s impact is different for larger businesses with more than 50 full-time workers, companies with new responsibilities under the ACA’s employer mandate. It’s different for smaller employers and it provides some opportunities for many of them. It’s a unique new context for start-up businesses because of the health insurance marketplaces that provide new businesses with a new way to provide health insurance for their workers, enabling them to outsource their health coverage needs for themselves and their employees. And it enables all employees to get health care coverage regardless of pre-existing conditions, which was not possible in 45 states prior to the ACA. So it’s contextual. It depends on the size and nature of the business as to whether there will be advantages or disadvantages—or both—to the Affordable Care Act. Q: Would you expand on how smaller companies can outsource their health care responsibilities? A:The ACA required the development of government-regulated health care exchanges (or marketplaces) across the nation. States had right of first refusal and 13 have chosen to establish their own exchanges while the rest are run by the U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). These exchanges offer coverage to all eligible individuals who can’t obtain insurance elsewhere, and many workers are eligible for financial subsidies to keep premiums and cost sharing affordable. Alongside these public exchanges, new private health insurance exchanges have emerged. Unlike the public exchanges, which largely provide insurance to individuals seeking to buy non-group coverage, these private entities are aimed straight at the employer community. These private exchanges can enable employers to address their responsibilities under the ACA’s mandate to provide health insurance for their workers and do it in ways that are far less onerous for employers than in the past. It’s a way to outsource these responsibilities and to provide employees with a range of coverage choices. This is a significant change from the environment that existed prior to the ACA’s passage in 2010. Q: How are larger businesses affected by the ACA? A:Prior to the ACA’s passage, larger businesses were concerned about not being heavily shaped by the new law because most of these businesses already covered most of their employees. The impact of the ACA on larger businesses—especially those that self-insure—is far less than what they would experience in the standard commercial insurance market were they to go out and purchase traditional coverage. Nonetheless, there are important new coverage requirements that impact the large employer market—whether self-insured or not. For example, lifetime or annual benefit limits on workers coverage is no longer permitted. Employer plans must cover the “essential health benefits” specified in the law. A worker’s insurance premium cannot exceed 9.5 percent of his or her household income or else the employer mandate penalty can be triggered. All employers must allow their workers to keep adult children on their family policies up to age 26. The ACA also sets a 90-day maximum waiting period before full-time workers are eligible for coverage. There are also some elements of the law that many employers appreciate, including the ability to vary worker premiums by 30-50 percent in relation to workers’ use of tobacco products and participation in workplace wellness programs. Clinically proven preventive care services, such as mammography, must be provided to workers without any cost sharing. The ACA’s impact is far more substantial in the traditional commercial health insurance market—but the impact on large self-insured employers is also meaningful. Q: Are all the details of the ACA settled at this point? A:This law is changing every day. There are at least three dozen things changing in relation to this law almost daily—in Congress, in federal agencies, in states, in the private sector—changes shaping how this law is unfolding across American society. And the pace of change hasn’t slowed, even now when we’re in the sixth year since the law was enacted. The ACA is likely to change even further next January when a new president and administration takes office, regardless of which party controls the White House and Congress. We can see an evolving agenda for changes from both sides of the political spectrum. Congressional Republicans have been united in their determination to dismantle the ACA for some time. In January, President Obama vetoed an attempt to cripple the ACA that was included in a budget reconciliation bill. The fact that this initiative passed Congress demonstrates that if Republicans control the White House, House, and Senate next January, there is a strong likelihood of significant dismantling of the law. Conversely, if the Democrats hold the White House next year they also will have an agenda for significant changes to the ACA, though far less dramatic than what would happen under Republican control. Either way, we can anticipate some significant changes coming in 2017. Q: How do business leaders prepare for that? A:They need to keep abreast of whatever changes occur. Many organizations help businesses to stay on top of what’s changing or likely to change. It’s important for executives and managers who focus on a company’s health coverage to stay up-to-speed on what’s happening, and it’s important for those in the C-suite to understand the changes to factor these new variables into their strategic planning calculus. As a nation, we are on a path of rapid and deep systemic change to our health system, and it’s going to unfold for some time to come. It is already transforming the fundamental nature of the U.S. medical care delivery system. The implications of it are vast and it will continue to unfold well into the future in positive, not-so-positive, and surprising ways. It’s important for corporate executives to understand the nature of these changes as they happen. The Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health will present a conference titled “Beyond the Affordable Care Act: The Next Frontiers for US Health Reform” on April 25-27.

MOST POPULAR ON BOSTONGLOBE.COM Based on what you've read recently, you might be interested in these stories ByDoug Bailey| January 12, 2016  First of a three-part series exploring the use of swaps, asset-based lending and foreign currency exchange to balance business risks and find opportunities. With interest rates suddenly inching up,businesses big and small are considering converting adjustable rate loans to fixed rates. Traditional refinancing methods are always available, but there is another option. Sophisticated fiduciaries at Fortune 500 companies have for years utilized derivatives known as interest rate swaps in order to better manage monetary risk. Interest rate swaps are, in their simplest form, an exchange of payments. One party in the swap trades the flexible rate on its debt to a fixed set of interest payments for a number of years – say five percent over 10 years. The other party receives adjustable rate payments, which are indexed to interest rates, usually the one or three month LIBOR rate. But in practice, interest rate swaps can be complicated and smaller to mid-sized companies might believe the derivatives game is beyond their scope of financial wherewithal or perhaps too risky to manage effectively. Not so. Today, more banks – and not just the money center banks – offer interest rate swaps to their customers and will take care of all the paperwork, regulation compliance, accounting, and monitoring to make the process as streamlined as possible. “These are tools being used by the major corporations to reduce risk,” said Michael Bontrager, founder and CEO of Chatham Financial, a global financial advisory services and technology firm based in Kennett Square, Pennsylvania. “Now,banks like Rockland Trust are saying that if you’re a smaller company you can have the same financial options – and protections – as the major corporations.” In a way, Bontrager notes, banks that are offering rate swaps are “democratizing the ability of more companies to avail themselves of these products.” Defining Swaps So what exactly are rate swaps? Why would someone want to use the product? And how do they work? It starts with the natural inclination of borrowers to generally want fixed-rate loans to better manage their costs and expectations. Banks, however, fund their loans with deposits that have fluctuating interest rates so managing net interest margins can be problematic, especially when short term rates are expected to increase. Therefore, the adjustable rate loans are lower risk and can be more preferable. This common tension creates markets and opportunities for both banks and borrowers. “With interest rate swaps we can offer our customers long-term fixed rates but the bank actually retains an adjustable rate,” said Jonathan Nelson, senior vice president and treasurer of Rockland Trust. “It’s a win-win all around.” It’s a win for borrowers because they can convert some or all of their floating rate debt to fixed rates – good to do in the current rising rate environment – without going through the time and expense of a total refinancing. It’s a win for the bank because it finds a third party wishing toreceive the fixed rate, while the bank retains the original adjustable rate.Because swapped loans are lower risk to the banks, the banks can then be more competitive on pricing, passing some of the benefit back to the borrower. In other words, the borrower is able to hedge their risk by locking in a more competitive long term fixed rate, while the bank takes on an adjustable rate loan that enables them to more adequately manage their margins. Interest rate swaps are traded over the counter, and if a company decides to exchange interest rates, it will need to agree, in theory, with another party on such things as length and terms of the swap. But mostly the bank handles those arrangements and the original borrower is not involved directly in those issues. Getting Under The Hood The mechanics of how it’s all done involves several parties – the bank’s customer, the bank, and a counter-party or swap dealer that the bank’s borrower never sees. A large money center bank – such as Deutsche Bank, J.P. Morgan, Wells Fargo or Bank of America – serves as a swap dealer. These are companies that make markets in swap trading and take positions in the swap markets for their own accounts. Riding herd on all of this are companies like Chatham Financial, which is an independent advisor for both the bank and the customer. “The advisor is there to make sure pricing is appropriate and the terms are structured properly,” said Rockland Trust’s Nelson. “Some customers may be new to swaps or may feel they don’t have the expertise,so firms like Chatham will guide them through the process.”  Chatham’s Bontrager notes that one of the advantages of a swap is it separates the debt decisions of corporate treasurers from the interest rate decisions. “Normally, those decisions are made simultaneously,” he said. “Swaps put a lot more control and flexibility in the hands of the treasurer.” There are other advantages, as well. Fixed rate loans typically carry pre-payment penalties while swaps may carry penalties in a falling rate environment, but they can create a realized gain if rates go up and the borrower elects to terminate the swap. Greg Vickowski, the chief financial officer of The Procaccianti Group, a privately held real estate investment and management company based in Cranston, R.I, has been utilizing swaps for nearly 30 years. His company buys hotels that are usually underperforming and renovates and rebrands them. Initially, he said, banks are less willing to commit to fixed-rate loans until the property stabilizes. “At that time we might swap all or some of the debt for a fixed-rate,” Vickowski said. “It’s highly advantageous and certainly less expensive and more efficient than refinancing an entire loan.” Vickowski notes, however, that nearly three-fourths of Procaccianti’s debt is in so-called CMBS instruments (commercial mortgage-backed securities) that have little flexibility and are not offered by most traditional banks because they tend to be more complex and volatile than residential mortgage-backed securities. “There’s a large population that doesn’t want to deal with CMBS shops because it can be slow, impersonal, cumbersome, inflexible and expensive,” he said. “That’s why banks like Rockland can prosper in this market. Vickowski says, “You can work directly with a banker and develop a relationship and the customer doesn’t have to bother or even know about what’s going on behind the scenes. If banks had the ability to offer CMBS debt, I’d only deal with banks.” Deciding If Swaps Are The Right Choice Financial experts say some of the factors in the decision matrix about swaps would include: “Adjustable rates have done really well over the last 10 years,” said Nelson. “But, given the current direction of short term rates, borrowers may now want to manage some risk by floating only a portion of it and moving some to a fixed rate.” There are, of course, inherent risks in rate swaps. Chief among them is the fact that interest rates are unpredictable. Swaps carry a market value that fluctuates with market rates.As rates change the borrower may float into an unrealized gain or loss position.If the borrower looks to exit their swap, their position will be monetized. Another risk involves the additional level of complication in managing one’s debt portfolio. Most of the risks can largely be mitigated by dealing with reputable institutions in strong financial positions and relying on well-established companies to represent the customers and the banks. Rockland Trust has successfully executed more than $1 billion in swap loans since 2009. With rates on the rise, many experts believe there will be an increased interest in rate swaps.

MOST POPULAR ON BOSTONGLOBE.COM Based on what you've read recently, you might be interested in these stories ByDoug Bailey| January 26, 2016  Final installment of a three-part series exploring the use of swaps, asset-based lending and foreign currency exchange to balance business risks and find opportunities. Like many businessmen, Peter Brust starts each morning by checking stock market prices and, most importantly, the foreign exchange market. He is most interested in euros, particularly the almost constant fluctuation in the value of euros against the dollar, and can quote from memory historic rates. “We were paying $1.35 to $1.37 for euros for the first two quarters of 2015,” he said. “Now they’re around $1.08 to $1.12.” Brust is not a currency trader. In fact, he doesn’t want to be one. “It might be fun until the pressure gets to you,” he said. But in his role as director of accounting and finance for John Matouk & Co., a Fall River producer of fine linens and luxury bedroom and bath items, he oversees the purchase of hundreds of thousands of euros each quarter and the selling of an equivalent amount of U.S. dollars. Many of the company’s overseas vendors insist on being paid in their native currency, usually euros, and Brust’s job is to try and reduce the impact a fluctuating euro-to-dollar rate will have on his company, which in 2015 had $25 million in sales. So, while 120 employees in the company’s beautiful new facility are manufacturing products with raw materials from all over Europe, Brust is carefully “hedging” against the moving foreign currency by locking in rates that allow him to meet Matouk’s budget and profit expectations regardless of where the rates go. “We only have the ability to reset our prices once a year,” he said. “So, the estimate that we make in the beginning of the year about foreign currency really does have impact on our business.” The currency rates, highly sensitive to world events, may currently be the most volatile in history.An economic slowdown in China, falling oil prices, a sliding Dow Jones Industrial Average, and a rising dollar can all contribute to major swings in the currency rates. They all command Brust’s attention. They also set Kim McKenna’s phone buzzing. “When volatility is rampant, we get more calls,” said McKenna, director of foreign currency exchange at Rockland Trust. “I guess volatility is good for our business, but it’s stressful for our customers and their businesses.” The businesses McKenna and her department deal with aren’t multinational corporations involved in massive currency trading and exchanges. They run the gamut, from the small independent firms that produce educational software, for example, to major equipment manufacturers and importers. “I would say about 90 percent of the bank’s business customers today are doing something internationally,” said McKenna. “We work with high tech companies, shoemakers, equipment manufacturers, even a company that imports carrier pigeons. Nearly every company today has an international presence.” The U.S. Department of Commerce said there were10,709 companies in Massachusetts engaged in exporting in 2013, and Bay State exports totaled $27.5 billion in 2014. Some company owners, McKenna said, hadn’t even considered the machinations and risks of overseas buying and selling when they went into business. They have come to rely on her and her department for guidance, advice and risk mitigation that far and away surpasses the simple swapping of one currency for another that her job title might suggest. “Many find themselves in situations not knowing what to do,” she said. “We give them solutions, or maybe several possible solutions, when analyzing the current environment.” The options for companies involved in international transactions are myriad and often complicated: “They’re in the business of making and selling products,” McKenna said. “They don’t want to get bogged down in analyzing the risks. That’s what we do.” Understanding challenges and risks A simple example illustrates the challenges of selling overseas. Suppose an American company sells equipment to a buyer in France for €1 million (1 million euros). The equipment is scheduled to be delivered 90 days before the payment is made. At the time the sale was made the exchange rate was €1.25 per dollar. At that rate, the company could expect to earn $1.25 million in gross revenues from the sale. Figuring its production and delivery costs at $1.15 million, the company could book a profit of $100,000. However, before the company received payment, the value of the euro fell to €1.10 against the dollar and that profit became a $50,000 loss. Of course, if the American company required the French company to make the payment in dollars instead of euros, the French company would bear the risk of euro to dollar fluctuation. But it doesn’t always work like that. “We have several companies that sell overseas and the foreign company insists on paying in their currency,” said McKenna. “They make it a contractual obligation and that often times increases uncertainty and anxiety about where rates are going.” To mitigate the risks associated with currency exchange many customers turn to “hedging.” Hedging is done by buying or selling foreign currency for delivery or settlement on a specific future date at a predetermined exchange rate. “You can limit, reduce and even eliminate the risks of fluctuating rates so that element of volatility is gone,” said McKenna. For example, 3D Incorporated, located in Weymouth MA, makes 3D printers. They import some of the parts from a company in Germany. That company invoices them in euros. Realizing the volatility in foreign exchange markets, specifically the euro, the company wants to protect its profit margin. So it enters into a hedge once a month for the euro payables. 3D has agreed to pay the German company €1 million in 60 days. So it immediately buys euros and sells US dollars with a forward contract. It locks in an exchange rate of €1.10 euros to the dollar, which will cost it $1.1 million. At this point, 3D doesn’t have to worry about the foreign exchange volatility and their profit margin is protected. If it didn’t hedge its exposure and the euro moves just two percent, the company would have to pay $1.122 million, $22,000 more than planned. The advantage to the hedge is that rates are locked in and there’s no guesswork or risk in losing money should the value of euro plummet. Of course, the company gives away any upside potential should the euro’s value against the dollar increase, but McKenna says most firms are more interested in simply mitigating the downside and not in playing the currency markets for gain. “The customer has to make the decision,” she said. “If they want to keep the risk, they can. I just tell them what I’m hearing, what I’m seeing, and what the various options are.” A recent national survey of US corporations showed that companies engaged in currency hedging saved anywhere from 10 percent to 15 percent a year on their bottom line. That’s pretty much in line with what John Matouk & Co. saves from hedging, an estimated 17 percent last year, according to Brust. The company projects and budgets its euro purchases quarterly, rather than tying their purchases to specific vendor invoices, he said. “So, if we were going to buy €10,000 and our budgeted rate is $1.15 [per euro], we might get a forward contract from Rockland Trust for $1.10 and lock in that rate at better margins than we expected,’’ said Brust. “So the rate might go to $1.20 or it might go to $1.05, but all we care is how we bid against our budgeted rate.” Currency fluctuations can affect businesses in many ways. Even if a US company doesn’t compete on the international market, it can still be subject to a risk because the price of its foreign competitor’s products may be affected by a change in the exchange rate. In order to effectively compete, the US company might have to lower prices. “Volatility has been so great lately, there are companies out there that could be doing very well, or very poorly, depending on whether they are importing or exporting, even if they are not hedging,” said McKenna. “But with these huge swings, they might sleep easier by hedging.” Sponsored byRockland Trust Bank How one woman’s autistic son inspired her autism-focused small business Frustrated by the lack of services for her son, a South Shore mom took matters into her own hands.

TheAtlantic.com,http://www.theatlantic.com/sponsored/ibm-transformation-of-business-part-2/diabetes-in-the-digital-age/562/,"Illustration: Jordon Cheung A day in the life of a diabetes patient is an exercise in micromanagement. Blood sugar metering. Insulin injections. Meal plans. Exercise diaries. Logs filled with heart rate, blood pressure, and even pain measurements. Itâs a lot to keep up with, for doctors as well as patients, but itâs also absolutely crucial. Proper diabetes management is key to a patientâs quality of life and to keeping blood sugar levels in line. For the 387 million people in the world living with diabetes, this is reality. But in many ways, their experience is not so different from that of Â the rest of us, who struggle to stay on top of our health and to effectively communicate to our health providers whatâs going on with our bodies. In America, about half of all adults suffer from chronic illnesses, and according to a 2013 Pew Research Center study, among those who do track their health, about half of them keep up with progress Â âin their heads.â Mobile app development, fueled by cloud technology, is going to change these habits dramatically. Already, wearable technologies, such as Fitbit, and food trackers, are helping us log our meals, movement, and weight. These seemingly simple devices have transformative powers. They have been proved to keep people motivated to exercise and lose weight. According to the Pew study, tracking also leads 40 percent of trackers to ask a doctor new questions or to get a second opinion. But digital tools are pushing healthcare to the cusp of a much larger transformation than that. Apps designed to improve our health are going far beyond simple one-feature tracking and peer support. The new apps are capable of sharing, analyzing, and visualizing real-time health data across different platforms and populations, inspiring a host of possibilities. These âwellness 2.0â apps will provide ways for people to take control of their own health and promise to transform our healthcare system by giving doctors valuable new insights and researchers clues to the prevention and management of chronic illness. âThe opportunity to put powerful but simple tools in the hands of an individual...as they try to manage their condition is so compelling,â says Sean M. Hogan, VP and General Manager of IBM Healthcare. âIt is absolutely going to change the face of medicine.â Robin Hrassnigg was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes in 1991. He filled out the usual logs and diaries until he created Diabetizer, a Web-based diabetes-management portal that will launch this fall as a mobile app for iOS and Android named myDIABETIZER. âIn the past, you had the diary and, with pen and paper, you put the information in the book. Thatâs the normal, old way,â says Hrassnigg. âWhat we give the diabetic is a complete overview about his or her health status, and this information can also be used to discuss the condition with their doctor.â Diabetizer works by pulling in information from a number of digital tools, including Fitbit, Runkeeper, and nutrition apps. It meshes that data with glucose readings and insulin information and presents an overall picture of health. Among its most useful features: A risk-index screen shows whether blood sugar, cholesterol, BMI, or any number of other indicators is in the danger zone. Graphs allow users to look back over the past week or even the past year to see how weight, heart rate, or blood sugar has fluctuated or to pick up on patternsâmaybe blood sugar is spiking on a day after too little exercise, for example. âThe app makes it all easy to handle,â explains Hrassnigg. âYou get more motivated in using it because it makes it fun and you get accurate information that you can look back over for yourself. You can look at your information on your mobile in your free time. That is a big advantage [if you want to discuss] your condition with your doctor and for getting a feel for your own health indicators.â Doctors are able to receive a PDF of a patient's latest health stats from the app, via email. âThe opportunity to put powerful, but simple tools in the hands of an individual and be able to maintain a connection with them as they try to manage their condition is so compelling. It is absolutely going to change the face of medicine. Diabetizer is just one example.â âItâs very important that you have that information with you and not only in the ten minutes that you are discussing with the doctor.â -- the doctor may be with you for ten minutes. âYouâve got more concrete information with you and from all over the world you can get access to your data. And itâs also very really easy for a patient to see what to change to improve my health.â âThe structural shift that weâre wrestling with is the existing systems of care that are all built around acute-care models, but a societal need that is chronic and to be really effective needs to be supported with an ongoing basis outside the hospital environment.â âWhat we give the diabetic is a complete overview about his health status with a risk index. And this information can then be used to discuss his condition with his or her doctor or they can send it via PDF to the doctor.â âIf you have information that might come from a fitness tracker to show your physical activity level, plus information from your glucose monitor, and youâre connected to your insulin pump, it's now possible that an app on your phone could tie all this information together to make an updated calculation in real time.â A day in the life of doctors who treat diabetes can be tedious. They are tasked with evaluating months of glucose readings and many other health indicators, sometimes in as little as 10 minutes while the patient is in the examining room. As for the patients, we all know what it's like to have a few minutes to explain symptoms during a doctor's appointment. Wellness apps back up these experiences with data that we can easily share with our physicians, which leads to better recommendations and better outcomes. âThe doctor is doing the same job,â says Hrassnigg, âbut the patient has more concrete and more detailed information, which can now be easily provided to the doctor for an updated review of a case. That makes it easier to discuss with a doctor.â What the world could use is more effective digital healthcare tools like Diabetizer, and fast. This is where advances in technology and cloud computing are finally cutting development times and making the process more democratic. Start-ups like Diabetizer, which moved its development over to IBMâs Bluemix cloud-based development platform earlier this year, can access a variety of cloud services instead of investing in expensive architecture. âAs a start-up, it was very good for us because the costs were low,â says Hrassnigg. For one thing, he adds, âwe didnât have to invest in a big server infrastructure.â Developers are also able to use the latest IBM Cloud services, such as IBM Bluemix, which offers a multitude of features and capabilities, to quickly add new functions into their apps. For example, Diabetizer used Bluemix to integrate fitness trackers as well as push notifications, email alerts, and photo storage into the app so that users can upload profile pics or even photos of a physical symptom they may want to share with their doctor. âWhatâs so exciting about an application built on IBM Cloudâs development platform is you can put it out to a community and rapidly understand if itâs working,â says Hogan. âThatâs vastly preferred to having to create an app and put it out on the market, wait multiple months, and go back into the lab.â Beyond drastically shorter development times, it also helps make apps effective right out of the gate. Developers are ultimately looking to create apps that people use and return to again and again, which in the case of wellness apps is how the real benefit occurs. In addition to rapid application development and response, IBM Cloud also provides analytics and data-insight services that help developers understand how they can continue to refine their apps to meet patient needs. Chronic diseases like diabetes are by definition daily and ongoing health issues. Theyâre caused, treated, and may ultimately be prevented by healthier choices and environmental factorsâa fact thatâs backed up by hard statistics. âStudies show that only about 10% to 25% of your health status is correlated to the clinical care that you receive and up to 30% associated with your unique genetic makeup,â says Hogan. âThe predominant influence, up to 60%, is associated with your health behaviors, social and economic factors, and physical environments.â Yet our healthcare system is currently set up in opposition to these facts. It deals with our well-being intermittently, through occasional doctorâs visitsâor worse, when our health spirals out of control and we are hospitalized. This method of care drives up healthcare costs for everyone, and beyond that, it fails miserably at keeping us well. âThe structural shift that weâre wrestling with is the existing systems of care that are all built around acute-care models,â says Hogan. âBut a societal need that is chronic and to be really effective needs to be supported with an ongoing basis outside the hospital environment.â Hogan adds that there's a real need to better understand risk factors for disease so we can improve intervention and prevent disease altogether. Itâs not that we need to cut out doctors while building a new health paradigm. Doctors benefit as much as patients do when we fill in the gaps and keep ourselves well between visits. But digital tools and the data that they collect are proving to be very effective drivers toward 24/7, engaged, empowered, and consumer-driven healthcare. And these tools are making doctors' lives easier too. As Hogan puts it, âthey provide a connection back to the physician without it being overwhelming.ââ Support 160 years of independent journalism.

For most people imagination is as far as it goes, and for those who actually pursue the ambition to become an astronaut, the barrier to entry is extremely high. NASA selects only a tiny fraction of applicants. In 2013, more than 6,000 people applied. NASA picked eight.

Itâs up there right now, orbiting the earth once every 90 minutes, 220 miles up. NASA will help you find where it is at any given moment righthere. What follows is for those of us who will never get to make the trip: a chance to see what itâs like up close. Duration: 4 Years Astronaut participates in a dress rehearsalPhoto: NASA When astronaut candidates begin training, one of the first things they have to master, oddly enough, is swimming. In addition to becoming scuba-certified, they have to swim three lengths of a 25-meter pool without stopping. Then they have to do it again in a flight suit and tennis shoes. This prepares them for spacewalks, also known as Extra-Vehicular Activities (EVAs), which refer to any work thatâs done outside a spacecraft. Astronaut candidates also undergo extensive training in hypobaric and hyperbaric environments, and with periods of simulated weightlessness. Missions to the ISS can require an additional two or three years of training after the initial astronaut candidate period. At the Sonny Carter Training Facility, also known as the Neutral Buoyancy Laboratory, a 6.2-million gallon water tank is used to simulate weightlessness, and a model of the International Space Station, fully submerged, allows them to practice everything theyâll be doing at the ISS, from such daily activities as preparing food to spacewalks. 1,000+Astronauts spend more than a thousand hours training for an ISS mission. 218As of July 2015, 218 individuals have traveled to the ISS. 100+Astronauts must become proficient at more than a hundred experiments before arriving at the ISS. 64 - 76Astronauts must be between 64 and 76 inches tall to be a mission pilot. Spacewalk training in the Neutral Buoyancy LabPhoto: NASA Duration: 10 Minutes ISS Expedition 16 astronauts and cosmonauts walk toward their spacecraftPhoto: NASA Since the end of the US Space Shuttle program in 2011, the Soviet Unionâs Soyuz capsule has provided the only transportation for astronauts and cosmonauts going to the International Space Station. Before takeoff, the team comes together at the Yuri Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Center in Star City, Russia, where they undergo a few more weeks of training. When itâs time to leave, the Soyuz, with 3 people fitting snugly aboard on top of a Soyuz rocket, launches from Baikonu, Kazahkstan, and travels the approximately six hours it takes to get to the ISS. When you canât move, it can be kind of excruciatingly painful. But, ya know, itâs the price we pay for getting to fly in space.â âAstronaut Scott Kelly 9.5It only takes the Soyuz 9.5 minutes to reach space. 4The Soyuz completes 4 orbits of the earth to align itself with the ISS. 7The Soyuz uses 7 rocket burns to align itself with the ISS. 17,500The Soyuz is traveling 17,500 mph when it docks with the ISS. Soyuz launches with ISS Expedition 43 crewPhoto: NASA 1959 - 1963 Long before the Russian Soyuz Capsule and the US Space Shuttle, there was Mercury. When Russia launched the Sputnik satellite in 1957, the United States began its own manned space program, called Project Mercury, kicking off what came to be known as âthe space race.â McDonnell Aircraft Corp., which later merged with Boeing, was selected as the lead contractor for the spacecraft in 1959 and was ultimately responsible for sending the first American into space, in 1961. MORE INSIGHTS FROM BOEING Duration: 5.5 Hours Soyuz approaching the International Space StationPhoto: NASA While it takes around 9.5 minutes to get to space, it used to take a total of two days to arrive at the ISS because of the extended docking process. But in March 2013, the Soyuz was able to complete the first leg of the journey in under six hours, bringing down the number of orbits required for alignment from 34 to about four. The forty-plus saved hours make a big difference when youâre crammed into a capsule in a massive spacesuit. Duration: 3 Months â 1 Year Nine station crew members gather for a portrait aboard the ISSPhoto: NASA Up until March of this year, typical missions to the ISS have lasted between three and six months. But now, American astronaut Scott Kelly and Russian cosmonaut Mikhail Kornienko are almost halfway through the first ever one-year mission to the ISS. More explicitly than any previous mission,the goal of the one-year experience is to see how the two men's bodies and minds react to such an extended period in space. This will help NASA determine how far humans are from being able to handleâphysically and psychologicallyâa trip to Mars, which could take several years. To get a sense of what that would be like, hereâs a look at Kelly and Kornienkoâs home: 925,000The International Space Station weighs approximately 925,000 pounds. 15The ISS completes 15 full orbits around the Earth each day. 88 miles of wire connect the internal power system of the ISS. 1The ISS is powered by one acre of solar panels. External equipment on the International Space StationPhoto: NASA Onboard the ISS Refracted image of an astronaut through a floating bubble of water.Photo: NASA Most people think itâs zero gravity that causes astronauts to float, but on the ISS thatâs actually not the case. In fact, the station is subject to 90 percent of the gravity thatâs found on the earth. Astronauts float on the ISS and outside on spacewalks because they are in a state of free-fall. They miss the earth because the speed at which they are travelingâ17,500 mphâis enough to counteract the force of gravity that would otherwise pull them down, so they just keep falling, as if theyâre always on the downhill side of a roller coaster. Even though they understand all this, they say, the feeling of weightlessness never gets old. A little push with your big toe will take you halfway across the station. Itâs like being Supermanâwith just the brush of a finger. It does not get old, even after 381 days.â âAstronaut Mike Fincke (The Atlantic) Astronaut Luca Parmitano floats freely aboard the ISS.Photo: NASA Onboard the ISS Astronaut Luca Parmitano on the treadmillPhoto: NASA However exhilarating, the state of weightlessness can actually be damaging to astronautsâ health. Over extended periods of time, astronauts can experience muscle weakening and bone loss (at a rate ten times that of an earthbound 70-year-old), because their bodies arenât forced to work against the pull of gravity. To counteract this, astronauts have to exercise for approximately 2 hours a day in machines that look quite different from those on earth. You sweat buckets up there. On the ground, when youâre riding the bike, the sweat drips off you. Up there, the sweat sticks to youâyou have pools of sweat on your arms, your head, around your eyes. Once in a while, a glob of it will go flying off.â âAstronaut Mike Hopkins (5,200 Days in Space,The Atlantic) Onboard the ISS Astronaut Scott Kellyâs living quartersPhoto: NASA In many elements of the ISS astronaut experience, there are attempts to approximate the creature comforts of life on earth. But, obviously, itâs never quite the same, and sleep might be the quintessential example of that. When itâs time to turn in for the night, astronauts don comfy pajamas, open the doors to their sleep pods, and zip themselves into a sleeping-bag-like enclosure. In space, though, they never actually lie down, knowing that when the lights go out and the doors close, theyâll just float in their sleeping bags, unaware of which way is up. Onboard the ISS Astronaut Kjell Lindgren corrals the supply of fresh fruit.Photo: NASA A lot of people think astronautsâ food is nothing like what we eat on earthâthat itâs all unrecognizable and, well, gross. But while almost everything they eat is either freeze-dried, thermostabilized (i.e. canned but not stored in metal), or powdered, requiring rehydrationâand while some foods are off the table entirely because they donât conform to NASAâs requirementsâmeals arenât as limited or unappetizing as we think, and the menu isnât completely out of astronautsâ hands. There are more than 200 items on the âcore menuâ that NASA offers, about 110 of which have been developed from scratch by the food lab scientists. Before traveling to the ISS, astronauts meet with NASAâs food lab to try out their options and make some selections for what they want to eat (each gets to pick nine for every six-month stint on the ISS). One of the astronautsâ favorites is freeze-dried shrimp cocktail with a spicy cocktail sauce, both of which have to be rehydrated. Every once in a while, though, the astronauts get a shipment of fresh fruits, and even non-freeze-dried ice cream. And when that happens, itâs a party! Onboard the ISS Astronaut Terry Virts gazes out the window in the cupola module.Photo: NASA The beauty of seeing Earth as a planet, as opposed to being down here among it, is a wonderful experience. To then start to get into what we call âThe Big Picture Effectâ or âThe Overview Effect.ââ âAstronaut Edgar Mitchell (Overview) Onboard the ISS Astronaut Karen Nyberg in one of the ISSâs labs.Photo: NASA The ISS is, above all, a laboratory. There are usually more than 200 experiments happening at any one time, which include everything from observing ant colonies to attempting 3D printing (in a weightless environment) to testing humanoid robots. Most of the experiments are focused on understanding how conditions in space affect, well, everythingâincluding the astronauts themselves. NASA astronaut Cady Coleman once referred to herself as a ""walking, talking osteoporosis experiment"" to see how human bodies hold up during extended periods of weightlessness, with the hope of better understanding how we can make space travel safe enough to go farther. 10The first spacewalk lasted 10 minutes. They now last up to 8 hours. 70 - 110Astronauts use 70-110 different tools on a typical spacewalk. 45Putting on a spacesuit in preparation for a spacewalk takes approximately 45 minutes. 280A spacesuit weighs 280 pounds on Earth, but feels weightless in space. Cosmonauts prep for a spacewalk.Photo: NASA Since the first expeditions to the ISS, there have been 188 spacewalks. Depending on the purpose, each one tends to last between five and eight hours. Spacewalk missions include testing equipment, making repairs to the station, and conducting experiments in open space. Not only can it be terrifying, it can also be extremely physically demanding, in part because the suits are pressurized and inflated with oxygen. The suit is like a latex glove that if you blow up, the fingers want to stick straight out, so it takes a little effort to grab onto things.â âAstronaut Mike Foreman (The Telegraph) For every hour they will spend on a spacewalk, astronauts train for seven in the giant pool in the Neutral Buoyancy Laboratory, where they perform virtual-reality simulations wearing gloves that allow their movements to appear integrated into a video of what theyâll be doing on the spacewalk. Onboard the ISS Astronauts watch the 2014 World Cup from the ISS.Photo: NASA No matter how incredible it is to float freely in space, to gaze at the earth during the sixteen sunrises or sunsets the crew experiences every day, there is, of course, an incredible longing for home and a need to stay connected. Luckily, they can call their families whenever they want from an IP phone and receive presents from loved ones during the holidays. And when itâs just them up there on the Fourth of July, straining to remember what BBQ smells like, sometimes they can catch a glimpse of fireworks on earth. You miss literally everything. You miss water that flows from the faucet and doesnât fly around you. You want to be surrounded by nature. You miss Earth, even though itâs always in front of you. All the normal everyday things that we often donât value here. Up there, they become most important.â âCosmonaut Mikhail Kornienko (Time) Beginning 2017 The Future of Passenger Space Travel Last year, Boeing won a $4.2 billion contract to design and build a passenger spacecraft that will bring people to and from the ISS. This will be the first American passenger spacecraft since the space shuttle was retired, in 2011, and will provide an alternative to the Russian Soyuz. One day in the not-too-distant future, it may provide commercial rides to space. MORE INSIGHTS FROM BOEING Duration: 3.5 Hours Expedition 42 Soyuz landingPhoto: NASA It's kind of like going over Niagara Falls in a barrel, but the barrel is on fire.â âAstronaut Dave Wheelock (ABC News) The trip back to earth from the ISS is quite different from the six-hour, rocket-propelled first leg. This time astronauts get back into the Soyuz and, after separation, do a careful de-orbit burn to slow down and achieve exactly the trajectory that will allow the capsule to reenter the atmosphere safely. After that, the long fall back to earth takes less than 3.5 hours. Reentering the earthâs atmosphere means reintroducing the body to the sense of its own weight. As the astronauts start to experience that feeling in the capsule, theyâre pulled deeper into their seats, which helps them brace for landing. Parachutes deploy and rockets fire from below to slow down the descent, which culminates in a relatively soft landing and rendezvous with a search and rescue team. 4-5Astronauts experience g-loads of four to five times their normal weight during landing. 30,000The first parachute opens at 30,000 feet to slow the capsuleâs descent. 10,764The landing parachute measures 10,764 square feet. 5The capsule hits the ground at less than 5 feet per second. Astronaut Rick Mastracchio is carried to the medical tent just after landing.Photo: NASA Iâve been telling people itâs like getting on the Tilt-a-Whirl, you know, that amusement ride â sitting on that for a couple of months and then getting off.â âAstronaut Daniel M. Tani And they are never the same, perhaps most of all because they have a new perspective on home, having seen Planet Earth from afar. As ISS astronaut Nicole Stott puts it: âI don't know how you can come back and not, in some way, be changed. It may be subtle. You see a difference in different people in their general response when they come back from space. But I think, collectively, everybody has that emblazoned on their memories, the way the planet looks. You can't take that lightly."" Support 160 years of independent journalism.

TheAtlantic.com,http://www.theatlantic.com/sponsored/chevron-stem-education/the-jobs-of-today/196/,"Whoâs the first person that comes to mind when you think about someone who uses advanced math and science every day? A doctor? A chemist? Certainly someone in a white lab coat. Perhaps an engineer performing calculations on a computer or working on complex machines? A Multi-part Series:Re-engineering the Futureof American Education Sure, these professions are the most closely associated with the science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) fields, but what about plumbers and pipefitters? Trigonometry is central to their work. And other workers in the trades, such as technicians who operate plants and refineries, need to keep the principles of chemistry and physics in their heads whenever theyâre on the job. With the expansion of advanced technologies and processes into more and more fields, the science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) economy is much bigger than many imagine and the barriers to entry are also lower than most think. Occupations like pipefitting and welding require only a high school diploma plus technical training to start. In fact, high school and community college graduates, along with those who donât have a four-year university diploma, hold half of these positions. These are well-paying jobs: Work that demands technical know-how, but not a masterâs or Ph.D., and pays better than the national average wage of $46,000. American plumbers and pipefitters, for instance, earned more than $49,000 in 2012, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Expanding out to other fields, a recent Brookings report found U.S. STEM workers who havenât attained a bachelorâs degree earn an average salary of $53,000, about 10 percent higher than non-STEM employees with the same educational background. For those looking to get into work that requires STEM skills, the Bureau of Labor Statistics is bullish about demand by employers, concluding that âSTEM occupations are...viewed as having some of the best opportunities for job growth in the future.â Indeed, the Commerce Department projects that the number of STEM jobs will have grown by 17 percent from 2008 to 2018. Taken together, the projected demand for more technical workers across all industries and the higher wages for all levels of educational achievement point to a revitalized, robust middle class as an achievable goal. It also means that science and technology are no longer walled off in labs and universities; they're on the job and in our daily lives. Thatâs why many community colleges and vocational schools across the country are ramping up their training programs in STEM fields. They see the national projections and hear from local employers who need skilled workers. At Mississippi Gulf Coast Community College (MGCCC), that need for employees has pushed the administration to build new facilities to teach STEM skills. In the near future, the school will have 35,000 square feet of labs and other space dedicated solely to training welders, machinists and instrumentation control technicians, among other tech-driven occupations. Carmen Walters, the vice president of one of MGCCCâs campuses, points to studies that show there will be some 46,000 available STEM jobs in the state by 2018. âWe feel confident that STEM jobs are growing in Mississippi,â she says. âEngineering and support jobs are well paid, and we want to train our students to get them.â The hundreds who matriculate every year with a combination of hands-on training and coursework will find jobs at the nearby power plant, chemical factory, shipyard or refinery. Travis Brooks, one such recent graduate of MGCCCâs Process Operations Technology course, said he enrolled because he wanted a career that allowed for growth and for him to work with his hands. He chose the Process Operations Technology track, which was created in partnership with Chevron, because completing it better positioned him for a job at the companyâs oil refinery in nearby Pascagoula. âI didn't want to sit behind a desk all the time, staring at a computer,â he says. âI remember the first time walking through the crude unit [where crude oil is refined] and seeing different types of pumps and different types of valves, and being able to follow out process flows and already knowing what everything meant."" Brock Clark, MGCCCâs dean for career, technical, workforce and community education, says people looking for work at a place like a modern oil refinery need the specialized, focused and hands-on training that a technical course can provide. But they also need that course to be based on the realities a worker will find inside the facility, not on obsolete systems. This is why the school forms partnerships with local companies to make the training programs match the changing needs of jobs. In many cases, the school hires retired workers or brings in company trainers to work with students full-time. âIt keeps us connected to whatâs happening in these industries,â says Clark. âPeople come here to teach what they learned over a 30-year career. They want to pass that knowledge on, and the companies know theyâre getting new employees trained to the level they need.â Career training in action. An information exchange and mentorship triangle among students, schools and employers is critical to companies working in South Mississippi and around the country, says Gary Yesavage, president of manufacturing at Chevron. The company has been hiring young workers aggressively because of a major workforce concern in the oil and gas sector that is also being seen in other industries. âWhatâs happening in the refining business is that itâs laden with baby boomers, and there are a lot of people near retirement,â Yesavage says. âThere are not a lot of people in the 10- to 20-year experience range. What I see is that demand will outstrip supply.â He says finding bachelorâs-level chemical, electrical and mechanical engineers is hard, and hiring enough trained technicians is an even bigger challenge. Itâs an issue being felt throughout the industry. âWe worry about our refineries. Are we going to be able to get the numbers and quality of skilled craftsmenâmachinists, mechanicsâfor our facilities?â he asks. âItâs a real opportunity for people who want to work hard. You can get a training certification or an associateâs degree and earn a very good living in this industry.â . Support 160 years of independent journalism.

MLive.com,http://blog.mlive.com/sponsored/2016/02/use_this_fruit_as_your_secret.html,"A committed athlete keeps an arsenal of training supplies and aids. From favorite energy bars to a lucky pair of shorts, an athlete develops many preferences among their routine designed for an edge. Nutrition is obviously a major factor in an athlete's training regime. What you eat not only aids performance, but assists in recovery and rest. An emerging nutritional option for athletes is the Montmorency tart cherry. A recent study from the Journal of the International Society of Sports Nutrition (JISSN) examined whether short-term ingestion of the powderedCherryPURE(r) Montmorency tart cherry supplementprior to and following intense resistance-exercise diminishes muscle soreness and recovery strength loss, while reducing markers of muscle damage, inflammation and oxidative stress. The impetus for the study was the established knowledge of Montmorency tart cherries containing nutrients with anti-inflammatory effects on the body from a previous JISSN study. That study monitored recreational marathon runners' consumption of cherry juice before and after a race. It was the first study that provided encouraging evidence of Montmorency cherries' role in subsiding the development of upper respiratory tract symptoms - which helps ward off colds and sore throats. Aiding recovery is a critical component in training since the repetitive nature of muscle contractions during high-intensity exercise induces muscular injury. Degeneration, inflammation, regeneration and fibrosis are potential consequences of a workout's lingering effects. For the more recent JISSN study, 23 resistance-trained men were matched based on relative fitness ability, age, body weight and fat-free mass. They were randomly assigned to ingest capsules containing a placebo or the CherryPURE(r) Montmorency Tart Cherry Powder for one time daily, including day of exercise and up to 48 hours post-exercise for 10 days. The assigned exercise for the study was back squats. Participants performed ten sets of ten repetitions at 70 percent of a one-rep maximum back squat exercise. Fasting blood samples, isokinetic MVCs and quadriceps muscle soreness ratings were taken pre-lift; and again taken 60 minutes, 24 hours and 48 hours post-lift. Analysis revealed Montmorency powdered tart cherry supplement consumption seven days before, the day of and two days after completing high-volume, high-intensity exercise appears to be an effective dietary supplement in reducing muscle soreness. So why is this important? Expedited recovery makes a major difference in an athlete's training. If you can prevent missing days due to muscle soreness, you won't experience a void in your exercise regimen. The best measure in spurring quicker recovery is by being proactive, rather than retroactive. If you're consuming the right nutrients before exercise, then you're preventing muscle damage during the workout, and thus accelerating recovery after. So how can you easily implement cherries into your diet? ChooseCherries.com recommends drinking a 10-ounce glass of Montmorency tart cherry juice before workouts. After the workout, drink an additional glass within 30 minutes of finishing (or snack on dried Montmorency tart cherries). This would supply you with an equivalent of nearly 100 cherries. You can also take one to three CherryPURE(r) Tart Montmorency Cherry Capsules daily with food as a dietary supplement.

MLive.com,http://blog.mlive.com/sponsored/2016/02/american_and_european_dishwash.html,"Bosch 24"" 800 Series Recessed Handle Dishwasher When it comes to dishwashers, style matters. One of the many things appliance shoppers may be unaware of when hunting for a new dishwasher is that today's dishwashers come in not just two main styles, but many. There's an ongoing debate in consumer forums between American and European dishwasher styles, which, up until the last few years, offer a very different set of features and benefits. European style dishwashers (by brands like Bosch) feature stainless interiors, fewer cycle settings, better energy efficiency and lower noise levels; while American style dishwashers by brands like Whirlpool offered flexible cycle settings and heated dry options. Although the debate between European vs. American style dishwashers continues, the reality is that today the lines have blurred between these styles, leaving a variety of options in both categories. For example, most American-style dishwashers today have stainless interior tubs, are much more efficient and operate with less noise; while most European-style dishwashers have added a variety of cycle settings. In short: many of what are considered standard European features are available in American brand dishwashers, and many American features are made by European brands. ""The truth is that most brands carry dishwashers with features that will appeal to most people. The conversation is now about finding the right model that has the features and benefits that meet your specific needs,"" said Scott Bekins, owner and president of localappliance and electronics retailer, Bekins. Bosch leads the charge in merging American and European styles As the largest European dishwasher manufacturer,Boschis used in more homes across America than any other European dishwasher brand. Bosch has also won the most awards from JD Power & Associates for customer satisfaction. Looking at how the American dishwasher market has responded to Bosch's presence over the years, there's no doubt that customer satisfaction with Bosch dishwashers has influenced American manufacturers in adopting many of the positive features of European dishwashers - Bosch specifically. As consumer preferences indicate, Bosch stands out as one of the most feature-rich and affordable of the European brands, according to local appliance expert Richard Tease. ""You will generally pay less for more features with Bosch,"" said Tease, who is an Appliance Sales Professional at Bekins in Grand Haven. The debate between heated vs. condensation dry evaporates Traditionally, American style dishwashers used a heater to dry dishes after the wash cycle (""heated dry""), while European styles relied on a draft of cold external air and hot stainless interiors to dry dishes using condensation (a process called ""condensation dry""). The results were an effective, but energy-consuming dry cycle, in American styles, and an energy-efficient, but less effective, dry cycle in European styles. Today, however, condensation dry and heated dry represent more of a spectrum than two distinct options. Almost all dishwashers use a heater - including European styles. Similarly, most American dishwashers have stainless interiors, which allow for condensation. Bosch's dishwashers, for example, use the heater for one minute to kick-start its ""condensation dry"" cycle, while KitchenAid uses a combination of condensation and heated dry. The result is a spectrum of dry cycle options, which suit a variety of different lifestyles. New industry standards for energy efficiency & noise level Shifting energy regulations have significantly heightened energy and water efficiency standards across the appliance industry, including both American and European dishwashers. As a result, the difference in energy efficiency between European and American style dishwashers is negligible today. What most consumers don't know, however, is that along with higher energy efficiency often comes less heat - and therefore less deep sanitization. John Ritzema, Appliance Sales Professional atBekins in Grand Rapids, says that's one of the reasons he recommends using the ""sanitize"" option when it's available. ""That sanitizes the dishes, but it also gets them as hot as possible, which will get them as dry as possible during condensation dry,"" said Ritzema. Along with greater energy efficiency comes less noise, in both categories. While dishwashers across both American and European styles are getting quieter, Bosch's dishwashers, remain among the quietest in the industry, with its dishwashers consistently being ranked as quietest among its peers byConsumer Reports. Under-the-radar features & benefits Drying method and noise aside, both European and American brands often carry additional features, which the right shopper may find invaluable. A dishwasher's style matters less than what specific features the brand offers, emphasized Tease, Bekins' appliance expert. ""Bosch, for example, is one of the few dishwasher brands that can fit flush with your cabinets after custom paneling is applied,"" said Tease. ""That makes it a very popular model for integrated kitchen remodels and new home construction. It all depends on what you need."" Bosch's dishwashers also include a feature called ""24/7 AquaStop"". This automatically senses any leaks that may occur, then shuts the water off and immediately pumps it out to ensure the dishwasher doesn't empty its contents onto the floor. For those who have had to replace flooring due to dishwasher leaks, this feature alone could be worth the investment. ""Some higher end Bosch models also include water softeners,"" said Tease. ""For families with hard water, this can be a very important feature."" Bosch dishwashersbegin at $499, going up to $2199 at the top of their premium Benchmark line. Popular American brands Whirlpool and KitchenAid are priced comparably, starting at $329 and going up to $1999.

The editorial department of Boston.com had no role in its production or display.sponsored content guidelines From poutine and meat pies to maple syrup-covered meals in sugar shacks,Québec City’srich cuisine is rooted in tradition. Named one of the Top 20 Best Food Cities in the World according to readers of Condé Nast Traveler, it owes much of its hearty flavor to a storied history as well as a booming contemporary food scene—making it an ideal destination for classic French dishes and modern twists alike. Take a bite out of the city’s culinary roots Traditional Québec City cuisine found its foothold during the fur trade period, shortly after French settlers came to Canada. Dishes featured both French-inspired tastes as well as lard or other fatty ingredients that kept traders warm and satisfied in the cold Canadian winter. One of the most popular dishes of the 1600s was tourtière, a spiced meat pie with a flaky crust. Traditionally made with game birds, it’s now more commonly served with fowl or pork during Christmas and New Year’s celebrations. For a taste year-round, make a reservation at the revered Restaurant Aux Anciens Canadiens and order “Grandma’s treat,” a classic Québec meat pie served with beans and potatoes. Taste a local specialty—now for every palate Arguably the region’s most popular dish, poutine (French-fried potatoes covered in gravy and cheesecurds) is rumored to have been first created in a Québec bar in the 1950s. While you’ll be happy with the poutine at just about any restaurant—this is Québec, after all—local fast-food chain Chez Ashton is one of the best-known local choices, lauded for its fresh-cut fries and homemade sauce. For a more contemporary take, head to Le Chic Shack, where you can choose from poutine with sophisticated toppings like wild mushroom ragoût, pickled onions, or horseradish aioli. Be in for a sweet surpriseIf you’re visiting Québec during the spring thaw, you’re in luck: it’s sugar season! Every March and April, Québecois gather to enjoy a gigantic meal of eggs, beans, ham, bacon, and deep-fried smoked pork jowls—all doused in a healthy serving of just-tapped maple syrup—at a local sugar shack (cabane à sucre). Comparable to the American Thanksgiving, the feast is served at long, family-style tables and often followed by a horse-drawn sleigh ride ortire sur la neige, wherein boiled maple tree sap is poured over clean snow to harden and create a maple taffy treat. Make plans for a more modern meal Though French tradition plays a large role in Québec City fare, the city’s contemporary cuisine is also influenced by the area’s varied culture. Locals enjoy dining out in the neighborhood of Saint-Jean, a bustling bohemian neighborhood with a historic past: It’s the home of J.A. Moisan, the oldest grocery store in North America. St-Jean’s recently revitalized neighbor, the Saint-Roch district, is also a trendy destination. Once a working-class neighborhood, its converted factories, artist lofts, and entrepreneurial spirit combine to create a wonderfully urban dining experience. Experience the best of the area’s cuisine with a leisurely brunch at Le Clocher Penché Bistrot, where your meal is served with a latte andverrine, an appetizer served in a small glass. Hop on to the city’scraft beer trend Next, enjoy an afternoon or evening at La Korrigane, a microbrewery owned by Catherine Foster, a former geologist. “My father started brewing his own beer in the early 90s, so I saw him brewing since I was a young girl,” says Foster, who opened La Korrigane in 2010. “The restaurant for which he brewed closed in 2008, and I was sad he was not going to continue selling his beer—so I bought his equipment to start my own brewery.” La Korrigane, one of many breweries in the city, still uses several of Foster’s father’s traditional recipes. “We have more than 25 recipes at the brewery, but we serve about eight to 10 at a time,” says Foster. All of the food at La Korrigane is locally grown and produced—“from the cheese to the beef to the potatoes for French fries,” Foster says. “We use fresh, local blueberries, cranberries, honey, and maple syrup in our beer, too.” Local produce, fresh for the eating (and picking)This seems to be a trend in Québec: Locally grown ingredients are becoming paramount in Québecois cooking. “Many restaurants in Québec City offer local, seasonal vegetables with their main dishes,” says Foster. One such restaurant is Panache Mobile, a food truck stationed at Vignoble de Sainte-Pétronille vineyard on Île d’Orleans. The truck is a spinoff of Panache, a four-diamond restaurant led by Louis Pacquelin, a respected local chef. The menu is adapted to whatever local produce is in season, so you can bet on fresh flavors year-round—though the lobster roll is a good choice any time of year.  If foraging for your own food is more your style, drive a few miles outside the city to a “U-pick” farm. Much like New England orchards, U-pick farms allow visitors to harvest their own fruits and vegetables for a farm-to-table experience. Pick apples, raspberries, black currants, and even asparagus at farms as nearby as Île d’Orléans, just a short drive from the city center. Enjoy the fruits of your labor on the spot, or head back to the city and pair them with gourmet cheeses and freshly-baked baguettes from a local bakery. Either way, you’ll finish your “tour de Québec City cuisine” as the locals do. Learn more about Québec City.

its production or display. MOST POPULAR ON BOSTONGLOBE.COM Based on what you've read recently, you might be interested in these stories | June 21, 2016 Sadie McCallum has ideas. A lot of them. In fact, they pop into her head pretty much all day long. The 9-year-old from Weare, New Hampshire, who just finished third grade, said her ideas come so often that she scrambles to get a few thoughts down on her laptop, so she doesn’t forget one before the next one comes—like theAmazing Curb Climber. Sadie has cerebral palsy, and while enduring a lengthy recovery from a double hip surgery at Boston Children’s Hospital during first grade, she had a lot of time to think. “I don’t get around as well as some other kids, so I rely on a walker for support,” she explained.  She’s a big reader—she wants to be a librarian and an author, and, who knows, maybe an engineer—but found it was a constant struggle to get over curbs at her town library using her walker. “I had to have my walker lifted or my whole body lifted because I couldn’t get up,” said Sadie. “So, I knew if I was going to be able to do what I wanted to do, I’d have to invent something. “I was thinking how much better it would be if my walker was an all-terrain vehicle to go over curbs. I was just sort of brain-storming the problem, but I didn’t know how to make one.” Sadie had her sights set on her school’s Invention Convention, an annual event that’s like a science fair for inventors. Having missed it the previous two years for health and family reasons, she was determined to enter this year. That’s where the rest of her family—parents Patrick and Miriam, brothers Jack, 16, and Harry, 11, and sister Claire, 6—stepped in. Sadie and Claire worked as partners. Sadie sketched out a vision for the new walker. The wheels were the key. They tried different configurations and sizes. What was best, three or four? One design had claws. “We went pretty crazy with ideas,” Sadie admits. There was some trial and error. Finally, they settled on a design. Then it was time for construction: plastic for the wheelbase. Lawn mower wheels. Her dad drilled and sawed for the wheel assembly and helped build a portable testing curb, while her mother edited the Inventor’s Journal and project board for the Invention Convention. Harry loaned skateboard parts, Claire aided with assembly and demonstration, and Jack chipped in a green screen to make a video to demonstrate the walker, then helped edit it. This was no paper mâché volcano. TheAmazing Curb Climberwon first place for “Best Use Of A Wheel” at the Center Woods Elementary School’s Invention Convention and second place for “Kid’s Choice.” At the regional competition, it won first place for “Special Needs Award” and another first for “Microsoft Technology Award.” “I never knew I’d be good at building things,” said Sadie. “But this let me open up my mind. I’m always thinking of things and wondering if they could be different.” She’s already mulling over walker upgrades (“Like turning,” she said.) and other inventions to help disabled people, such as a wheelchair with an umbrella. But that’s not all that happened this year for Sadie. She said she did really well in her school spelling bee. And, at Boston Children’s Hospital, where she’s been treated since being diagnosed with cerebral palsy eight years ago, Sadie had her second big surgery, this one to transfer an overactive muscle behind her knee. After much hard work in physical therapy, she stood and took the first unassisted steps of her life. “They just looked at me when I stood up, because I had said I couldn’t do it when people asked me before. Some people cried,” she said. Patrick said prior to the two surgeries, Sadie could barely walk with her crutches or a walker. On a good day, maybe one aisle at the grocery store at most. Now, he said, “it blows our minds” how far she has come. The goal of physical therapy now is to build on that progress and see how far it takes Sadie, said her mother. “Two-and-a-half years ago, she was in a wheelchair. You can’t underestimate the power of small steps,” said Miriam. On the wall of Sadie’s bedroom is a giant hand-lettered sign welcoming her home after surgery. It’s got good wishes scrawled all over it. Sadie talks with lots of people, and connects with almost everyone.  “I joke with her that she’s a gifted monologer,” said Miriam with a laugh. “Part of it is her verbal skill, which is a natural gift. She is also emotionally intelligent and really good at communicating that. She’s an old soul. “Her attitude is better than anyone I know. Her circumstances require it. And she’s such a pragmatic, levelheaded person. Her attitude is, ‘What good does feeling sorry for myself do?’ If she could change it, she would. But she looks at things she can be grateful for.” Deborah Lynch, enrichment coordinator for the Weare School District, has worked with Sadie throughout her three years at Center Woods Elementary. Lynch marvels at Sadie’s ideas, her writing, and her ability to communicate. But there’s more. “She stands out for me for who she is—not just how smart she is, but because her core values are outstanding,” said Lynch. “Sadie is very mature and thinks of the world around her. She is constantly generating ideas and most of them are very selfless. She sees other people’s struggles as greater than her own and wants to make things better for those people.” Added Lynch: “I believe she can do whatever she puts her mind to. There is nothing out of the realm of possibility for her. I think she will change the world.” Orthopedic surgeon Dr. Benjamin Shore met Sadie and her parents as part of her interdisciplinary team in Boston Children’s cerebral palsy program. He has performed both surgeries to improve her mobility. “I remember the day I met her,” said Shore. “She was six and had these bright glasses. She locked eyes with me and held the stare. Then she started to talk and held court. There were 10 doctors in the room and everyone listened to her.” Hospitalizations and surgery are, of course, stressful and scary for many young patients. Shore said Sadie had a unique way of coping with upcoming surgery. “She was really scared but very brave,” he said. “One way she helped keep her emotions in check was to carry around a rock, a common rock. She had it with her in the bed in the preoperative area, and it came into the operating room with her. It just helped her ground herself and not get too anxious. I was impressed. I’d never met a child who had used a rock in this way before.”  Over the years, Shore has marveled at Sadie’s attitude. “Sadie’s gone through a huge amount of rehab. She and her parents committed to the challenge and everyone has always been super positive. She’s such a great patient, bright, determined—she wants to get better and works so hard at it. “I visited her after the second surgery and she was telling me about what she was doing the next weekend. Not bragging at all, very humble, telling me about the [Invention Convention] coming up. She showed me her video. It reflects the way Sadie and her parents think about her and her cerebral palsy. They don’t let it slow her down. Nothing is going to stop her from doing what she wants to do. Really, that’s who she is,” said Shore. It’s easy to forget Sadie’s age when she talks of her disability. “I have cerebral palsy, but its not all that bad,” she said. “I could have it a lot worse than this. I could have a disability that could be worse. If people with worse disabilities can stay positive, then I can stay positive.” It’s summer vacation now and Sadie’s got a lot to do. Books to read, short stories to write, PT to attend three times a week, a novel to work on work about a princess named Lucy and a dragon named Little Snow Bee, and other ideas to consider. Lots and lots of ideas.

You take a deep breath- it smells fresh, you see the window drapes are open and the light is pouring in the room.  Everything is in order, the colors are harmonious with no clutter in sight.  That's the same environment we want to create when preparing your home to sell. Home staging is creating a simple, clean, and neutral space that allows any buyer to picture their own family eating at the kitchen table or watching TV in the family room.Why should you spend the time, effort and possibly money to stage?  Staging can shorten the time the home spends on the market, and the increase in sophistication can bring more money.  It may be impossible to measure the exact time saved and dollars earned, but we don't need a study with dollars and percentages to tell us that it makes a difference. When buyers walk into a warm and inviting home that is beautifully staged, it allows them to make their own emotional connection to the space.  They perceive a much stronger value to that property when it is clean, in order, and has a unified flow throughout.  An important fact to keep in mind is 90 percent of people start their home search on the Internet.  Staging has taken on a new urgency as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and more are being used to post pictures of your home.  Quick sales often hinge on great professional photography.Why does staging seem overwhelming to many? When you combine busy schedules with the uncertainty about the cost and time involved, the idea of staging can feel like a challenge. You may not think your furnishings could ever work, but I felt the same way about my wardrobe until I let a professional into my closet!  It takes the right eye for it, so hiring a design professional or Realtor who provides this service can be the simple help you need.  By asking to see pictures of previous work, you'll have an idea of what to expect.Let's address the emotional block. As a seller, one important thing to remember is that you have already decided to move.  So the time to emotionally detach is not when the tape goes across the last box! From the start of your decision, your home is now a house and a very important business transaction.  Your job is to create a space for your future buyer to fall in love with and this does not include the entire photo wall of grandchildren from birth to college graduation, or the glass figurines that you have collected around the world for 45 years. As beautiful as those things are, they are an emotional attachment that makes your home so beautiful to you.  Home is where the heart is, so spend more time packing things of the heart now and there will be less to do at the last minute.  Once you emotionally detach, it will be much easier to depersonalize. Your home may not feel as comfortable to live in with half your heart packed away and furniture moved around for better flow, but now you are ready to sell a house and make more money doing so. Make your house stand out from the crowd.  Happy Staging and happy selling! Note to readers: if you purchase something through one of our affiliate links we may earn a commission.

AL.com,http://www.al.com/realestate-sponsored/2015/09/birmingham_realtor_offers_5_ti.html,"Clark D. Edwards Re/Max Southern Homes 280 cell: (205) 515-1022 clarkDedwards@bellsouth.net www.clarkDedwards.com As real estate markets continue to improve, buyers are finding many more options to choose from in the neighborhoods they love. Sellers, on the other hand, are finding more competition appealing to buyers. ""It's like a job interview or a first date,"" says Clark Edwards. ""You get one opportunity to make a first impression."" Edwards, a Realtor specializing in the over-the-mountain market for RE/MAX in Birmingham, offers five tips to selling your home faster in a competitive market.Hire a RealtorThere may be a temptation to list your home yourself, but this can be a mistake in most cases. Hiring a professional Realtor with experience in your area will pay off with access to the local MLS, price comparisons, a marketing plan and good advice when it comes to pricing and presentation. Your Realtor can arrange a professional appraisal.Curb AppealMaking that first impression is a key factor and it often happens earlier than you think. A potential buyer usually has two or three favorite neighborhoods in mind before they ever make first contact. ""If your home doesn't invite them in, they will pass it by,"" says Edwards. You don't have to spend a fortune to give the front of your home a makeover. Get rid of that dead shrub you've been giving a little more time to make a comeback. Plant some inexpensive, living, plants around the exterior of the home and mix in some bright colors with flowers. Change the light bulbs around your front door and make sure all of your exterior lighting works and is turned on in the evenings. A homeowner can typically recover all of the curb appeal costs when the home earns a contract.Get rid of clutterA buyer wants to imagine their family living in your home. Put away some of your collectibles--as cool as they may be--and make sure the home looks neat and livable. Too much clutter can be the difference between looking lived-in and looking worn out. Before listing your home, put away some of your favorite things in expectation of an imminent move and purge any unwanted items by donating to thrift stores or simply tossing away things you don't need.Be available and be preparedWhen your Realtor is working to market your home, you need to be ready for a showing on a moment's notice. Keep the home tidy and put away any personal, or embarrassing, items that can harm a presentation. Before leaving each day, put away bathroom items, dirty clothes, and load the dishwasher. These simple steps can be annoying when you are in a hurry but can help you sell your home faster.Make smart upgradesMany people upgrade kitchens, bedrooms, and family rooms to improve the time they spend in their homes. When it comes time to sell, focus on the smaller things. Fresh paint, where needed, can improve the look of a room without spending money on major renovations. Simple cosmetic changes like new curtains, fixtures, or a rug can enhance the selling power of your home. Be prepared to bargain when it comes to upgrades. Your buyer may want to replace carpet--even if it looks good. Your Realtor can advise you on offering a suitable carpet allowance to sweeten a deal for your buyer. If your carpet is worn past its prime, it is worth the investment to change it to an inexpensive, neutral color.Selling a home can be stressful, especially if you have your eye on a new home for yourself but your contract is contingent on closing on your present home. No Realtor can guarantee the time frame for marketing a home but a full service Realtor can be the most important asset you have when it comes to beating the competition.

AL.com,http://blog.al.com/sponsored/2016/02/5_psychological_behaviors_that.html,"water-for-weight-loss.jpg As important as it is to focus on what you eat to lose weight and keep it off, it is equally crucial to consider physical activity and maintaining lifestyle changes over time. The problem is that making changes to your lifestyle is hard. How many times have people fought to lose weight for a certain occasion like a wedding and then gain it all back just a few months later? True weight loss means making a long-term behavior change. How to make behavioral changes, what strategies we use to adhere to new ways of eating and increasing physical activity cannot be ignored. Cognitive-behavioral therapyfocuses on changing how you think about yourself, how you act, and circumstances that surround how you act. It's an effective treatment for a wide range of problems including weight loss but the key is to focus on making changes and sticking to them. Goal setting When it comes to weight loss, a goal to eat fruit for dessert is specific and can be clearly tracked.  Specific goals around exercise or types of food you will eat -- behaviors you have control over -- are better than goals to improve cholesterol or glucose levels, which may fluctuate for reasons outside your immediate control. Motivation Intrinsic motivation (behavior that is driven by internal rewards) can be a powerful ally in your weight loss battle. A lot of times, people are instead motivated by external factors such as praise from other people, or peer pressure to lose weight. Long-term weight loss is about helping you feel better about yourself and creating a lifestyle that YOU can enjoy. Environment What is shaping your path to success when it comes to your surroundings? Are they helpful or a hindrance to your weight loss journey? A good example is having a spouse who eats processed foods and always picks up lunch or dinner for the both of you. Or do you always go out to eat with coworkers who like to eat dessert after every lunch? Some simple ways to reshape your path is to offer to cook dinner so you have control over your meals or bring your lunch to work during the week and let Friday be your lunch with the co-workers. Accountability It can be helpful to get feedback from outside sources.  Feedback about your diet or exercise routine can provide motivation or help you adjust your behavior.  Outside feedback also can help you keep your expectations ambitious but realistic. Belief I know people hate to hear this, but weight loss is more about the journey than the end result. You will have setbacks and disappointments with your goals. You have to practice patience but also believe in yourself and know you have the willpower to make these changes. True change can't happen unless you believe in yourself and your capabilities.

Given the dramatic increase in migrants moving from Central America through Mexico to the United States, both countries recognize the vital importance of rapidly resolving the humanitarian emergency and security situation. The Governments of the United States and Mexico will work together to immediately implement a durable solution. As a result of these discussions, the United States and Mexico commit to: Mexican Enforcement Surge Mexico will take unprecedented steps to increase enforcement to curb irregular migration, to include the deployment of its National Guard throughout Mexico, giving priority to its southern border. Mexico is also taking decisive action to dismantle human smuggling and trafficking organizations as well as their illicit financial and transportation networks. Additionally, the United States and Mexico commit to strengthen bilateral cooperation, including information sharing and coordinated actions to better protect and secure our common border. Migrant Protection Protocols The United States will immediately expand the implementation of the existing Migrant Protection Protocols across its entire Southern Border. This means that those crossing the U.S. Southern Border to seek asylum will be rapidly returned to Mexico where they may await the adjudication of their asylum claims. In response, Mexico will authorize the entrance of all of those individuals for humanitarian reasons, in compliance with its international obligations, while they await the adjudication of their asylum claims. Mexico will also offer jobs, healthcare and education according to its principles. The United States commits to work to accelerate the adjudication of asylum claims and to conclude removal proceedings as expeditiously as possible. Further Actions Both parties also agree that, in the event the measures adopted do not have the expected results, they will take further actions. Therefore, the United States and Mexico will continue their discussions on the terms of additional understandings to address irregular migrant flows and asylum issues, to be completed and announced within 90 days, if necessary. Ongoing Regional Strategy The United States and Mexico reiterate their previous statement of December 18, 2018, that both countries recognize the strong links between promoting development and economic growth in southern Mexico and the success of promoting prosperity, good governance and security in Central America. The United States and Mexico welcome the Comprehensive Development Plan launched by the Government of Mexico in concert with the Governments of El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras to promote these goals. The United States and Mexico will lead in working with regional and international partners to build a more prosperous and secure Central America to address the underlying causes of migration, so that citizens of the region can build better lives for themselves and their families at home.

U.S. Department of State,https://www.state.gov/united-states-restricts-travel-and-vessels-to-cuba/,"PolicyIssues Countries &Areas About Mission Leadership Administrative History Directories Visit Bureaus &Offices Media Note Office of the Spokesperson Washington, DC June 4, 2019 Share this page on: Today, the United States took strong action to prevent U.S. travel to Cuba from enriching the Cuban military, security, and intelligence services by announcing new restrictions on authorized travel and vessels to the island. Going forward, the United States will prohibit U.S. travelers from going to Cuba under the previous ‘group people-to-people educational’ travel authorization. In addition, the United States will no longer permit visits to Cuba via passenger and recreational vessels, including cruise ships and yachts, and private and corporate aircraft. The United States holds the Cuban regime accountable for its repression of the Cuban people, its interference in Venezuela, and its direct role in the man-made crisis led by Nicolas Maduro. Despite widespread international condemnation, Maduro continues to undermine his country’s institutions and subvert the Venezuelan people’s right to self-determination. Empowered by Cuba, he has created a humanitarian disaster that destabilizes the region. These actions are directly linked to the tourism industry, which has strong economic ties to the Cuban security, military, and intelligence sectors in Cuba. Veiled tourism has served to line the pockets of the Cuban military, the very same people supporting Nicolas Maduro in Venezuela and repressing the Cuban people on the island. In Cuba, the regime continues to harass, intimidate, and jail Cubans who dare to voice an opinion different from the one the regime wants them to have. The United States calls on the regime to abandon its repression of Cubans, cease its interference in Venezuela, and work toward building a stable, prosperous, and free country for the Cuban people.

Share Feedback Contact:USDA PressEmail:press@oc.usda.gov (Washington, D.C., May 23, 2019)– U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue today announced that the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) will take several actions to assist farmers in response to trade damage from unjustified retaliation and trade disruption. President Trump directed Secretary Perdue to craft a relief strategy to support American agricultural producers while the Administration continues to work on free, fair, and reciprocal trade deals to open more markets in the long run to help American farmers compete globally. Specifically, the President has authorized USDA to provide up to $16 billion in programs, which is in line with the estimated impacts of unjustified retaliatory tariffs on U.S. agricultural goods and other trade disruptions. These programs will assist agricultural producers while President Trump works to address long-standing market access barriers. “China hasn’t played by the rules for a long time and President Trump is standing up to them, sending the clear message that the United States will no longer tolerate their unfair trade practices, which include non-tariff trade barriers and the theft of intellectual property. President Trump has great affection for America’s farmers and ranchers, and he knows they are bearing the brunt of these trade disputes. In fact, I’ve never known of a president that has been more concerned or interested in farmer wellbeing and long-term profitability than President Trump,” said Secretary Perdue. “The plan we are announcing today ensures farmers do not bear the brunt of unfair retaliatory tariffs imposed by China and other trading partners. Our team at USDA reflected on what worked well and gathered feedback on last year’s program to make this one even stronger and more effective for farmers. Our farmers work hard, are the most productive in the world, and we aim to match their enthusiasm and patriotism as we support them.” Listen to Secretary Perdue’s comments about the announcement: American farmers have dealt with unjustified retaliatory tariffs and years of non-tariff trade disruptions, which have curtailed U.S. exports to China. Trade damages from such retaliation and market distortions have impacted a host of U.S. commodities, including crops like soybeans, corn, wheat, cotton, rice, and sorghum; livestock products like milk and pork; and many fruits, nuts, and other crops. High tariffs disrupt normal marketing patterns, raising costs by forcing commodities to find new markets. Additionally, American goods shipped to China have been slowed from reaching market by unusually strict or cumbersome entry procedures, which affect the quality and marketability of perishable crops. These boost marketing costs and unfairly affect our producers. USDA will use the following programs to assist farmers: Further details regarding eligibility and payment rates will be released at a later date. # USDA is an equal opportunity provider, employer and lender."

Share Feedback Reliable, High-Speed Broadband e-Connectivity is Essential to Enhanced Agricultural Production Contact:USDA PressEmail:press@oc.usda.gov WASHINGTON, April 30, 2019– Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue today unveiled a groundbreaking report,A Case for Rural Broadband: Insights on Rural Broadband Infrastructure and Next Generation Precision Agriculture Technologies(PDF, 2.5 MB). The report finds that deployment of both broadband e-Connectivity and Next Generation Precision Agriculture Technology on farms and ranches throughout the U.S. could result in at least $47 billion in national economic benefits every year. “Broadband and Next Generation Precision Agriculture are critical components for creating vital access to world-class resources, tools and opportunity for America’s farmers, ranchers, foresters and producers,” Secretary Perdue said. “Under the leadership of President Trump, USDA is committed to doing our part to clear the way for nationwide broadband connectivity that will allow the next generation of precision agriculture technologies to thrive and expand.” DownloadA Case for Rural Broadband: Insights on Rural Broadband Infrastructure and Next Generation Precision Agriculture Technologies(PDF, 2.5 MB). To see how Next Generation Precision Agriculture Technologies can work on farm and ranching operations, view theConnected Technologies infographic(PDF, 910 KB). The report also finds that if broadband infrastructure and digital technologies at scale were available at a level that meets estimated producer demand, the U.S. economy could realize benefits equivalent to nearly 18 percent of total agriculture production. Of that 18 percent, more than one-third is dependent on broadband e-Connectivity, equivalent to at least $18 billion in annual economic benefits that only high-speed, reliable internet can provide. For many years, USDA and the American agriculture industry have been actively researching the feasibility, usage and potential upside of Next Generation Precision Agriculture technologies. Until now though, the interdependency of these technologies and broadband e-Connectivity has not been evaluated. The report released today explores this symbiotic relationship and quantifies the potential economic benefit of broadband buildout and the complementary adoption of connected agriculture technologies. Going forward, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) will be engaged in multiple facets of infrastructure and technology deployment, including financing rural capital investments and supporting producers who are exploring which Next Generation Precision Agriculture Technologies are best suited to improve their operations and serve their customers. In April 2017, President Trump established the Interagency Task Force on Agriculture and Rural Prosperity to identify legislative, regulatory and policy changes that could promote agriculture and prosperity in rural communities. In January 2018, Secretary Perdue presented the Task Force’s findings to President Trump. These findings included 31 recommendations to align the federal government with state, local and tribal governments to take advantage of opportunities that exist in rural America. The Report identified Achieving e-Connectivity in Rural America as a cornerstone recommendation. The Administration has been executing this priority call to action through theAmerican Broadband Initiative (ABI)(PDF, 647 KB), which reflects rural broadband build-out as one of President Trump’s directives to the Federal government.A Case for Rural Broadband: Insights on Rural Broadband Infrastructure and Next Generation Precision Agriculture Technologies(PDF, 2.5 MB) opens the next chapter in the USDA’s response to this call to action. To view the report in its entirety, please view theReport to the President of the United States from the Task Force on Agriculture and Rural Prosperity(PDF, 5.4 MB).

/*--><!]]>*/ News Release SPANISH FORK, UT– After an investigation by the  U.S. Department of Labor's Wage and Hour Division (WHD), Leggings Live –  operating as Legg-A-Licious – has paid a total of $84,048 in back wages,  liquidated damages, and penalties to resolve violations of the Fair Labor  Standards Act (FLSA) at the company's Spanish Fork, Utah, facility. Investigators  found the employer violated overtime, minimum wage, recordkeeping, child labor,  and anti-retaliation provisions in the FLSA. WHD found Leggings Live violated child labor requirements by employing  minors under the required minimum age of 14 years. The investigation found the  employer terminated one worker's employment after they reported the illegal  employment of minors to WHD. In addition, WHD  found violations resulting from Leggings Live's employment of these minors to  work more hours than the law allows, and to work in jobs involving activities  prohibited by law for workers less than 18 years old. Specifically, Leggings  Live employed minors to load and unload merchandise from motor vehicles to  stock the employer's warehouse. The employer also violated  FLSA minimum wage requirements when it failed to pay for all the hours one  employee worked during one workweek. Overtime violations resulted from the  firm's practice of paying employees straight time without regard to the number  of hours they worked. Back wages were found due for five employees who worked  more than 40 hours in some workweeks without being paid overtime. ""Employment  standards for minors ensure that they gain a positive work experience that does  not interfere with their education, health, and well-being. Child labor  violations can be avoided when employers understand the rules,"" said  Wage and Hour Division District Director Kevin Hunt in Salt Lake City, Utah.  ""In addition, employees should not have to fear retaliation when they exercise  their rights under the law. The Wage and Hour Division will continue to use all  available resources to enforce worker protections."" Leggings  Live paid a total of $42,560 in back wages and liquidated damages to six employees,  which included $33,664 to the  employee terminated in retaliation for reporting the child labor violations. In  addition, the employer paid $41,488 in civil money penalties for violating FLSA  child labor provisions. The U.S. Department of Labor offers numerous resources to  ensure employers have the tools they need to understand their responsibilities  and to comply with federal law, such asonline videos, confidential  calls, or in-person visits to local WHD offices. For more information about  theFLSAand other laws  enforced by the Wage and Hour Division, contact the Division's toll-free  helpline at 866-4US-WAGE (487-9243). Employers who discover overtime or minimum  wage violations may self-report and resolve those violations without litigation  through thePAID program.Information is also available atwww.dol.gov/whdincluding asearch toolto use if you think you may be owed back wages  collected by WHD. 200 Constitution Ave NWWashington, DC 202101-866-4-USA-DOL1-866-487-2365www.dol.gov Connect With DOL"

National Center for Public Policy Research,https://nationalcenter.org/ncppr/2019/06/07/salesforce-rejects-diversity-far-left-board-votes-to-remain-liberal-enclave/,"San Francisco, CA/Washington, D.C. –Software giant Salesforce has rejected a shareholder resolution designed to encourage a diverse balance of thought on the tech giant’s left-leaning board of directors. The vote came in response to a shareholder proposal submitted byFree Enterprise Project(FEP) DirectorJustin Danhof, Esq., at yesterday’s annual meeting of Salesforce investors held in San Francisco, California. Danhof’s proposal noted that “[d]iversity isn’t what someone looks like. It’s the sum of what that person thinks, feels and believes. When the company takes overtly political positions on legal and policy issues, it would benefit from having voices from both sides of the aisle in the room.” The full text of the proposal is available on page 72 of Salesforce’s proxy, availablehere. Justin Danhof, Esq. “Salesforce has become one of the nation’s most influential companies over the past decade. Unfortunately, the tech giant is using its outsized power as a weapon of left-wing social engineering,” said Danhof. At the meeting, Danhof noted: Salesforce spends significant capital advancing liberal positions. For example: * The company threatened to divest from the state of Georgia over that state’s consideration of a religious freedom restoration law, falsely suggesting that the measure was designed to discriminate against the LGBT community. * The company also signed the Human Rights Campaign’s (HRC) highly disingenuous amicus brief in the Masterpiece Cakeshop, Ltd. v. Colorado Civil Rights Commission U.S. Supreme Court case. The company’s position would have allowed states to compel speech of private businesses and citizens all while further eroding religious freedom. * And the Washington Post recently reported that Salesforce has instituted a new policy taking aim at the 2nd Amendment. Specifically, the company is barring its clients that sell certain guns, clients such as Camping World, “from using its technology to market products, manage customer service operations and fulfill orders.” This could damage the company, as existing clients may leave and new clients may consider other software options. Danhof then stated: Whether you’re willing to admit your bias is beyond the point. In business, perception is often reality. And our proposal provides a tangible way for the company to combat its bias. We believe that boards that incorporate diverse perspectives can think more critically and oversee corporate managers more effectively. Appointing a few conservatives may help the company avoid groupthink. That’s a win for investors and a win for true diversity. The full text of Danhof’s statement, as prepared for delivery, is availablehere. Audio of Danhof’s statement is availablehere. “I was encouraged that one of the board members approached me to thank me for my statement and suggest he was in agreement with us,” noted Danhof. “However, when it comes to Salesforce’s left-leaning public policy positions, it seems his voice isn’t being heard inside the boardroom. “You don’t need laws to upend the culture,” continued Danhof. “Salesforce is working to upend commerce and culture in ways that shift society further to the left. Religious Americans, gun rights supporters and conservatives need to do a much better job of reaching out to these left-wing corporate actors in the same way that liberal activists do. Until we do that, the corporate march to the left will continue largely unabated.” Yesterday was the seventh time FEP has presented a board diversity resolution at a corporate shareholder meeting this year. FEP has also called uponApple,Starbucks,Discovery,Twitter,AmazonandFacebookto increase ideological diversity on their left-leaning boards. Yesterday’s Salesforce meeting marks the 25th time FEP has participated in a shareholder meeting in 2019. Support our work! Click this image to help us advocate for diversity of viewpoints on leftist boards. Launched in 2007, the National Center’s Free Enterprise Project focuses on shareholder activism and the confluence of big government and big business. Over the past four years alone, FEP representatives have participated in over 100 shareholder meetings – advancing free-market ideals about health care, energy, taxes, subsidies, regulations, religious freedom, food policies, media bias, gun rights, workers’ rights and other important public policy issues. As the leading voice for conservative-minded investors, FEP annually files more than 90 percent of all right-of-center shareholder resolutions. Dozens of liberal organizations, however, annually file more than 95 percent of all policy-oriented shareholder resolutions and continue to exert undue influence over corporate America. FEP activity has been covered by media outlets including theNew York Times, Washington Post, USA Today, Variety, the Associated Press, Bloomberg, Drudge Report, Business Insider, National Public Radio and SiriusXM. FEP’s work was prominently featured inWall Street Journalwriter Kimberley Strassel’s 2016 bookThe Intimidation Game: How the Left is Silencing Free Speech(Hachette Book Group).

National Center for Public Policy Research,https://nationalcenter.org/ncppr/2019/05/31/conservatives-face-hurdles-breaking-liberal-hold-on-the-arts/,"Conservatives are oftenencouragedto change the culture by becoming more of a part of it. Don’t like what’s on television? Develop conservative shows. Dismayed about the state of modern music? Write and produce your own songs. The left understands the importance of influencing the culture. And that’s a big reason for the current state of our union. They have noticed that conservatives ARE venturing out more into the arts. So the left is putting up roadblocks to stop conservatives’ progress. One recent example of the left’s attempt to stifle conservatives in the arts is the stonewalling of Phelim McAleer. A journalist who changed careers to become a filmmaker, he first became known for the 2009 documentary“Not Evil JustWrong”that rebutted Al Gore’s climate-alarmist “An Inconvenient Truth.” Last year, McAleerproduced“Gosnell: The Trial of America’s Biggest Serial Killer.” The title pretty much says it all. Gosnell was a purveyor of illegal abortions in horrific conditions with no respect for humanity. He is currently in prison for his crimes. This film chronicled the investigation, arrest and subsequent trial. “Gosnell”had good crowdsourced funding, a seasoned screenwriter and bankable actors. Despite all that, there were efforts tosuppressthe movie. NPR and Facebook refused to run ads. Hyattcancelleda screening of the movie in one of their hotels. Yet the movie broke about even. With $4 millionraisedfor production, the filmgrossedaround $3.8 million domestically. Even with all of the left-wing impediments, Phelim McAleer was a success. He is now trying the stage – and finding more leftist pushback. In Washington, D.C., he had planned to produce “FBI Lovebirds: Undercovers” at the small Mead Theatre. The play is about Peter Strzok and Lisa Page, the philandering FBI agents who ignominiously ended their careers as possible Deep State operatives in an attempt to derail the Trump presidency. It is set to star Dean Cain (of television’s “The Adventures of Lois and Clark” and “Gosnell”) and Kristy Swanson (the original “Buffy the Vampire Slayer” from the movie). But the play has been sidelined for now after the theater ownership groupcancelledthe play due to “threats of violence.” The media reported an alleged tweet complaining about the play that read, “lock the doors, and set the theater on fire.” The theater ownerstoldMcAleer:“We have an institutional responsibility to protect the safety of our staff, patrons, rental guests and community. In the best interests of all involved, we must ask that you find another venue for your event.” But McAleercontended:“This is censorship of facts that they want to keep hidden from the American people, and they are hiding behind ‘safety concerns’ in order to squash diversity of opinions in the theater.” But the show will go on. The script for “FBI Lovebirds: Undercovers” will still be read by the cast. It will still be performed by the cast – somewhere. It will be filmed, and the recording will be distributed. What was once set to be performed before 218 seats at the time for a short run will now be seen on the screens of millions of people and enjoyed long into the future. McAleer succeeds again! Conservatives ARE successfully engaging in the culture. Phelim McAleer is not the only one. Nina May ofRenaissance Women Productionsis making films such as “First Lady” and television shows such as “Daily Bread.”Pureflixis making – and nowstreamingthrough its own service – family-friendly and faith-oriented films such as “God’s Not Dead” and “Dancer and the Dame” with stars such as Billy Gardell, Kevin Sorbo and Della Reese. Then there’s the case of Dennis Prager and Adam Carolla. They are putting together a documentary called“No Safe Spaces”about the threat to free speech on campuses and how “what’s happening on college campuses today is the bleeding edge of our cultural decline.” It’s to be released soon, but Facebook has made it harder to promote. Students atActon Academy– a charter school in Roseville, California – sought to earn credits toward an entrepreneurship requirement by holding an advance screening of “No Safe Spaces.” When they sought to advertise it on Facebook, however, they were blocked. Why has Facebook placed a hold on Acton Academy ads for the documentary about free speech? Because the school won’t declare itself a political entity. Since Facebook has allegedly determined the content of the documentary to be related to “issues of national importance,” ad buyers are supposed to declare their political affiliation as a matter of compliance. But Acton Academy is not a political entity.  School CEO Matt BeaudreautoldThe Hollywood Reporter: They asked me a bunch of personal questions, then said I’d need to identify as a political entity, even though the ad doesn’t mention a party or a politician and takes no political stance whatsoever. Noting that this makes one of the points of the documentary, Prageradded: Unlike liberals, who always valued and fought to protect free speech, leftists have never valued free speech. And the left controls the avenues of information on the Internet. That’s what this is about. What to do? The National Center’sFree Enterprise Project(FEP) is trying to help. At Facebook’s May 30 annual meeting of shareholders, an FEP representativeraised the Acton Academy issuedirectly with CEO Mark Zuckerberg and COO Sheryl Sandberg. Appearing uncomfortable having to answer the question about Acton Academy’s problem, Sandberg replied: “There’s no requirement for anyone on Facebook to affiliate with any political party at any time.” She also committed to “take a look” at the school’s issue. Sandberg and others on the panel clearly did not want to take any follow-up questions about it, but were willing to accept a copy ofThe Hollywood Reporterarticle. FEP had earlier made apresentationat the Facebook meeting regarding a proposal to help politically balance the company’s board of directors. Facebook opposed it, suggesting that any additional steps to keep the company in line are unnecessary. The Acton Academy issue is Facebook executives’ first chance after our proposal to show that they mean that they say. Facebook can help conservatives contribute to the culture, not suppress it.    "
Hillary Daily,https://hillarydaily.com/brandon/2017/04/18/new-book-reveals-that-obama-pushed-hillary-to-concede-in-2016-election/,"Exposing Hillary So She Won't Get Elected April 18, 2017 Share Tweet Former President Barack Obama was the one who pushed Hillary Clinton to conceded to Donald Trump in the late hours of the morning the day after the election. Moments after doing so, she called the president back and apologized for the defeat, according to an excerpt from a new book, “Shattered: Inside Hillary Clinton’s Doomed Election Campaign,” obtained by theDaily Mail. The book was written by political journalists Jonathan Allen and Amie Parnes, detailing the roller coaster ride Clinton took on Election Night. According to the authors, Clinton felt she “let her country down,” when she spoke to former President Obama and knew his legacy laid “shattered at Donald Trump’s feet.” “You need to concede,” Obama told Clinton as the results came in and it was apparent that she had been defeated. Then-President Obama was “determined to make sure that his friend understood that the election was over” and that he “didn’t see any point in prolonging the inevitable” as he wanted to avoid a “recount mess.” After the call, Clinton’s aide, Huma Abedin, called Kellyanne Conway and got the two candidates on the phone where Clinton gave her concession. “Congratulations, Donald,” she reportedly said. “I’ll be supportive of the country’s success and that means your success as president.” Moments later Obama called again, according to the book. Obama’s legacy and her dreams of the Presidency lay shattered at Donald Trump’s feet. This was on her. Reluctantly she rose from her seat and took the phone. “Mr President,” Clinton said softly. “I’m sorry.” An excerpt previously released from the book also revealed how Clinton and her husband, former President Bill Clinton, abused staff after a defeat to Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders in the Michigan primary. Hillary for President? No thank you. |Developed with LOVE by the ONCE Interactive Lab ©"
Hillary Daily,https://hillarydaily.com/jrc/2015/04/16/hypocritical-hillary-announces-clinton-foundation-to-continue-receiving-foreign-donations/,"Exposing Hillary So She Won't Get Elected April 16, 2015 Share Tweet Folks, this is just more of the same. At this point, with all we have seen and heard already, there can be very little doubt that Hillary Clinton is untrustworthy and essentially a hypocrite for almost every serious issue she claims to support. In fact, the only area in which we can say Hillary is authentic and consistent is in regards to money. Her campaign and her support follows the money…pretty much like every other liberal politician. The other day, we reported about some of theforeign donations her Clinton Foundation has accepted. We also went into detail about a specific time she changed her position on an issue due to foreign donations received (regarding the US-Colombian Free Trade Agreement). So, willHillary be a president that is bought and paid for by foreign governments? Will the policies of the US be subject to whichever government delivers more into the coffers of our heir to be? Given her interesting history, and that of her husband, these are fair questions that we need to at least ask ourselves. There will probably not be a satisfactory answer coming out of the Hillary campaign any time soon. The Clinton Foundation has actually received more than $100 million in foreign government donations. But wait, the good news is that now Hillary will limit which countries can donate. Great move. More from The Wall Street Journal: “The board of the Bill, Hillary, and Chelsea Clinton Foundation has decided to continue accepting donations from foreign governments, primarily from six countries, even though Hillary Clinton is running for president, a summary of the new policy to be released on Thursday shows. The rules would permit donations from Australia, Canada, Germany, the Netherlands, Norway, and the UK—countries that support or have supported Clinton Foundation programs on health, poverty, and climate change, according to the summary. That means other nations would be prohibited from making large donations to the foundation. But those governments would be allowed to participate in the Clinton Global Initiative, a subsidiary of the foundation where companies, nonprofit groups, and government officials work on solutions to global problems.” Ultimately, this really changes nothing. Foreign governments will likely just funnel donations through groups and organizations in one of the ‘allowed’ countries. Plus, the whole issue really comes down to whether Hillary is going to put the interests of the US first, or the interests of her own foundation first? You can be the judge of that, based on everything we have seen with her email scandal, Benghazi, and other questionable judgment calls. By the way, there is even more evidence of Hillary being an out-and-out hypocrite. Her reputation of being a champion for women and feminism might erode quickly if people really knew she has accepted millions in donations from countries like Saudi Arabia, where women have no rights and they favor Sharia Law. What do YOU think about all this? Hillary for President? No thank you. |Developed with LOVE by the ONCE Interactive Lab ©"

The so-called Equality Act is essentially a sexual orientation and gender identity (SOGI) accommodation mandate at the federal level. Like the “bathroom bills” at the state and municipal levels in recent years, the measure would add sexual orientation and and gender identity to the list of classes protected by civil rights laws such as race, sex, age, and physical disability. The Heritage Foundation hasoutlined seven waysthe Equality Act would affect Americans: 1. It would penalize Americans who don’t affirm new sexual norms or gender ideology. 2. It would compel speech. 3. It could shut down charities. 4. It would allow more biological males to defeat girls in sports. 5. It could be used to coerce medical professionals. 6. It could lead to more parents losing custody of their children. 7. It would enable sexual assault. Small business owners, especially those who service the wedding industry, are already in the left’s crosshairs. Cake bakers and florists likeJack PhillipsandBarronelle Stutzmanhave had their livelihoods threatened by government agencies for refusing to participate in same-sex weddings under similar SOGI accommodation laws in their states. The Equality Act’s implementation would open more business owners to lawsuits, including doctors and mental health professionals. Fortunately, the Senate appears to have no desire to allow the Equality Act to move forward this Congress. On the other hand, major corporations, at the behest of the liberalHuman Rights Campaign (HRC), are openly endorsing the legislation’s anti-religious liberty provisions.

The debt owed by a nation to those who have given their very best—everything, to be precise—weighs more than a value statement to be measured by human understanding. Though, how we carry on their legacy perhaps provides the greatest meaning. From Concord and Lexington to the modern day Middle East, the men and women who have died in battle have provided us with examples of honor, valor, courage, and all the traits to which we should ascribe. The character values of the fallen are intrinsically tied to the patriotic spirit we uphold when we recognize what they have given on Memorial Day. This weekend, as we remember our greatest heroes, one segment of theÉgard Watch Company video response to Gillettecarries particular meaning. A Department of Defense statistic citing how men comprise 97% of war fatalities appears as Egard’s CEO Ilan Srulovicz asks, “Is a man a hero?” Srulovicz then asks, “Is a man a protector?” While the rows of white headstones in Arlington and national cemeteries across the country are the resounding answer to these rhetorical questions, aspects of our culture are sadly disconnected from the realities of what type of persons are memorialized in those places. Under each headstone lies a warrior, embodying the traits of strength, bravery, and, when needed, aggression. Yet, as those decidedly masculine traits are vital in combat, the fallen soldier has exemplified so much more. Love of country, love of others, and self-sacrifice become the transcendent characteristics to a grateful nation. By their nature, men are driven to be providers and protectors for their families, and we hope you will read the growing collection of accounts of these men we have postedhere. Furthermore, we recognize that this very nature is what leads these same men to become the heroes we remember on Memorial Day. They are not here for us to thank them directly, so it is only right that we honor what they have given by remembering that they have showed us the very best in men.

Crime Prevention Research Center,https://crimeresearch.org/2019/05/major-new-research-on-school-safety-schools-that-allow-teachers-to-carry-guns-havent-seen-school-shootings-during-school-hours/,"Featured 13 May , 2019 After the Columbine school shooting 20 years ago, one of the more significant changes in how we protect students has been the advance of legislation that allows teachers to carry guns at schools.There are two obvious questions: Does letting teachers carry create dangers? Might they deter attackers? Twenty states currently allow teachers and staff to carry guns to varying degrees on school property, so we don’t need to guess how the policy would work. There has yet to be a single case of someone being wounded or killed from a shooting, let alone a mass public shooting, between 6 AM and midnight at a school that lets teachers carry guns. Fears of teachers carrying guns in terms of such problems as students obtaining teachers guns have not occurred at all, and there was only one accidental discharge outside of school hours with no one was really harmed. While there have not been any problems at schools with armed teachers, the number of people killed at other schools has increased significantly – doubling between 2001 and 2008 versus 2009 and 2018. The paper isavailable here. The Excel file with the data isavailable here.  concealed handguns allowed on school property,CPRC original research,List of States that allow carrying guns on school property,school security,School Shootings Byjohnrlott Related posts I’d like to see the trend line for schools in states that allow licensed citizens, not just teachers and staff, to carry concealed in schools. Yes, I would be interested in data on licensed citizen carry in schools also. It would be the red bottom trendline because it’s already at zero You can’t go below zero! it can’t be lower than 0. …unless Jesus shows up! I taught for fifteen years, from high school through postgraduate levels. I always considered the safety of my students to be my first responsibility.I carried more days than not. No one, not even my wife, ever knew.It’s better to be safe than beg for permission.If you feel you should carry, carry. If you do it right and you don’t need the gun, nobody will ever know. And if you do need it, no one will argue. “And if you do need it, no one will argue.”Maybe not in your state, but in some states the good guy can end up being the bad guy for wasting the “poor misunderstood” perp.  //sarc off//The more dead children the merrier it is for the left in their quest for absolute control when a major step would be the confiscation of all guns that they do not own. Exactly! Perfectly said! Would like to see a clean list of which states allow carry and the year it was enacted. As a law enforcement veteran of 53 years, I have always known and espoused that “Gun Free Zones” were not only counter-productive but that the legislators who implemented them had blood on their hands. Glad to see America finally waking up. As a firearms instructor for my department I have always offered and given free training to those willing to take on that heavy burden of responsibility.. I live in the UK and cannot remember a school shooting in the last 20 yearsThe problem is not that teachers aren’t armed- it is the ridiculous notion that it is somehow safe to allow millions of ordinary citizens free access to lethal weapons that gives rise to the phenomenon in the first place! WULF BEST, so for the last 20 years there has been no killings in UK schools? Note I am not differentiating  killing by gun vs other means. Murder is murder. Worry about your own country. Not ours. In yours they have finally resorted to taking away knives because killing still continued after they took away you right to self defense with a gun. The problem is people, not guns. People will always find a way to do their killing. Gun or not. We here are unwilling to give up our right to guns and become sheep to the government. I haven’t looking into your school shooting rate, but it’s interesting that if a person is shot dead in the middle of the street, he not considered to be murdered unless someone is charged with the crime.  I suppose that makes it seem safer. Your murder and crime rates went up since gun control (while the U.S.’s have been trending down, despite loosening gun-control laws). Why do you suppose gun control work well for the UK? The anti-science anti-gun fascists aren’t listening. Dead children are okay if it helps disarm the people. It’s interesting, but it would be helpful to have a more careful statistical analysis to check how unlikely the result is to occur by chance. The article gives some figures on numbers of deaths. But deaths are clustered, since a single incident might be responsible for multiple deaths. It is great to hear from you. The problem is that I don’t know the number of school districts in each year that have teachers that carry guns. We were able to contact each school that had a shooting to see what the rules were for that school at the time of the shooting. But the decision is usually up to the individual schools and that would require that we contact all the school in states that allow it. The one option that I have is to take the states that didn’t leave it up to the individual schools either way. My concern is that would greatly reduce the sample, primarily on the side of states that let teachers carry. But that said, whatever the odds, you have convinced me that I should give it a try. Thanks for reaching out. John is correct. Data collection is very difficult, because the decision to authorize concealed carry is usually left to the school district, if not to the individual school, and there are often confidentiality requirements that prevent anyone from sharing information as to who, or how many personnel may be armed in any district or school.  These are sensible precautions, but one effect is an unwillingness on the part of schools, districts, and states to share information with researchers.  All you can do is look at actual shooting incidents and ascertain whether there were legally armed staff present in that school. Meaningful analysis need not include data on  whether there were actual legally armed staff present in that school, but simply if armed staff are allowed (as long as the public is aware that an attack might be met with deadly force from staff.) For the left, dead kids are ok too if they are an inconvenience. Here is the real problem, Left vs. Right.  There is no black or white answer to the problem.  As stated in a earlier reply, PEOPLE are the problem.  I do not consider myself on the Right or Left, I have been a teacher for 32 yrs in middle and high school in CA where some of the toughest (worst) gun laws exist.  I smoke marijuana AND own guns.  The real problem is the extremest on both sides have to dramatize both ends, with out actually solving the problem, too many people in too few places, with too few jobs and hope of a decent life.  I will continue to protect my family and home, but will continue to vote for laws that actually protect people and lives.  No child or adult who is causing no harm should be killed by any means, just to satisfy some political agenda.

I couldn’t resistcommenting. Very well written!  Hi, I log on to your newstuff daily. Your story-telling style is witty, keep doing what you’re doing!http://cspan.org In 1982, Kennesaw, Georgia passed a law requiring heads of households to keep at least one firearm inthe house. The residential burglary rate subsequently dropped 89% in Kennesaw, compared to just 10.4% drop in Georgia as a whole.Today, the violent crime rate in Kennesaw is 85% lower than the national average. Thanks John, great research. A quick note about Colorado.: Although there is no law regulating the training involved, the insurance companies have a definite say! There is no one in CO who has staff carrying on campus whose insurance company doesn’t require initial training, ongoing training and practice, and annual re-qualification.Thanks,Laura CarnoFASTERColorado.com […] Lott spoke with Sandy Rios about the STEM Highlands Colorado School Shooting and our new research that shows it is actually very safe for teachers to carry in schools. Data on the rate of […] How many lives have been saved by allowing teachers to be armed? How many injuries have been prevented? Page 9, paragraph 1 of the paper mentions a subset of the school districts, but I wonder what it was across the entire data set? Assuming the distribution of shootings is random across the population (ie uniform), it seems like this would be the talking point for this paper. It’s hard to determine lives saved, but there are multiple examples where shooters wrote in their manifesto how they chose not to attack areas where they knew they could meet armed resistance. We can thank Joe Biden for Gun Free Zones.  He introduced the bill in the Senate.  Elect him and get more of the same. Red flag laws work because no one who has been disarmed by one has committed a gun crime after (so they claim). Therefore a;;owing teachers to be armed is a good thing, because no school district allowing armed teachers/staff has had a school shooting. Gun free zones are bad because that is where mass shootings occur. Can’t logically argue for one and against the others.This is why getting rid of gun free zones should be the minimum that we get if they want ANY gun restriction.

Crime Prevention Research Center,https://crimeresearch.org/2019/05/editorials-across-nine-newspapers-in-florida-research-disproves-hysteria-about-arming-teachers/,"Featured 31 May , 2019 Ourrecent research on school shootingshas gotten an extensive editorial write-up in nine newspapers across Florida. Palm Beach Daily News, May 30, 2019;Florida Times-Union, May 30, 2019;Daily Commercial, May 30, 2019;St. Augustine Record, May 30, 2019;Gainesville Sun, May 30, 2019;Sarasota Herald-Tribune, May 30, 2019;News Chief(Winter Haven, Florida), May 30, 2019;Ocala StarBanner, May 30, 2019; andThe Ledger(Lakeland, Florida), May 30, 2019 . . .This year, Republican state lawmakers and Gov. Ron DeSantis, also a Republican, expanded the program by enacting legislation that allows teachers to participate.The move was widely condemned by the statewide and local teachers’ unions, anti-gun activists and liberal politicians who made fearmongering, emotional claims about the increased risk of teachers carrying guns to protect themselves and their students. Critics ignored both the recommendation to arm teachers by the special task force that investigated the Douglas High shooting, and data that show violent crime in Florida and across the country has dropped to the lowest levels since record-keeping began, even as the number of firearms throughout the country as proliferated. The common refrain among opponents was that students may seize a gun from a teacher, or that a frazzled teacher may end up shooting students or faculty in an active-shooter event, or that police might mistake an armed teacher for the gunman. They instead called for stricter gun control, more regulation of gun purchases and more resources to treat mental health matters, which seemed to be a common factor among mass shooters. Yet at roughly the same time as Byrd’s announcement, John Lott, president of theCrime Prevention Research Centerand one of America’s foremost researchers of gun ownership and gun crime, released a study that, had it received wider attention, might have poured cold water on some of the critics’ arguments. Lott’s report coincided with the 20th anniversary of the Columbine High School massacre in Colorado. He noted that since Columbine some 20 states had enacted laws to permit teachers to carry guns in some capacity. Lott then analyzed all K-12 school shootings that occurred between January 2000 through August 2018. He reached one overarching, and sobering, conclusion: School districts that arm teachers are remarkably safer than those that don’t. “There has yet to be a single case of someone being wounded or killed from a shooting, let alone a mass public shooting, between 6 AM and midnight at a school that lets teachers carry guns,” Lott observed. “Fears of teachers carrying guns in terms of such problems as students obtaining teachers (sic) guns have not occurred at all. … While there have not been any problems at schools with armed teachers, the number of people killed at other schools has increased significantly — doubling between 2001 and 2008 versus 2009 and 2018.” Continuing, Lott wrote, “There hasn’t been a single mass public shooting in any school that allows teachers and staff to carry guns legally. … If there is going to be a school shooting at a school with teachers carrying guns, it will most likely be during hours when no teachers are present.” Additionally, he noted, “The average rate of death or injury from shooting is 0.039 per 100,000 students across all schools (so the rate is higher among schools that don’t allow teachers to carry), while it is 0 per 100,000 in schools with armed teachers.” “In Europe, which has suffered three of the five worst K-12 school shootings in the world,” Lott pointed out for contrast, “every single mass public shooting has occurred in a gun-free zone.” We pray that Byrd is correct: that guardians will be a sufficient line of defense in Polk County schools. Of course, as Lott wrote, security personnel often become a gunman’s first target because eliminating them eliminates his main threat. In his report, Lott asks, “What’s our backup plan when violence does occur?” Apparently, since Polk opted to not arm teachers, our school district doesn’t have one. It’s unfortunate that Byrd and the School Board, which applauded her stance, chose to rely on anti-gun hysteria instead of facts in making this decision. Let’s hope that won’t cost children their lives. Update   Tampa Bay Times, June 1, 2019, quoting part of the above editorials. “Back in late April, as the Legislature was wrapping up a bill that would allow Florida’s school districts to arm their teachers, Polk County Public Schools Superintendent Jacqueline Byrd slammed the door shut on the idea.… Yet at roughly the same time as Byrd’s announcement, John Lott, president of the Crime Prevention Research Center and one of America’s foremost researchers of gun ownership and gun crime, released a study that, had it received wider attention, might have poured cold water on some of the critics’ arguments.”  Media Discussion on CPRC Byjohnrlott Related posts Very misleading article and research paper.The paper looks at school shootings from 2000 to 2018 in places where teacher-carry (CCW), is allowed.But most counties and school districts  became teacher-carry only recently, (within the last 6 or so years).  The results are skewed.Also, areas with teacher-carry tend to be rural and sparsely populated.Population wise, the total number of counties and districts that allow teacher carry is miniscule.The authors make a grandiose conclusion about the success of arming teachers based on a few years of data representing less than 5% of the total U.S. population. You have entire states in different parts of the country that have had teachers carrying for decades — New Hampshire, Utah, Rhode Island, and parts of Oregon.

Ethics & Religious Liberty Commission,https://erlc.com/resource-library/articles/3-ways-christians-can-view-politics-as-good-works,"Donate By Neal Hardin Jun 10, 2019 Some Christians maintain that they are not able to participate or serve in government faithfully as a Christian. They might say that politics is inherently dirty and corrupt. Therefore, to engage in politics sullies us and our witness. Or perhaps they will claim that government is a secular institution which cannot be mixed with our commitment to live by faith. However, I would argue that this is not the case. Political involvement can be a good enterprise for Christians to engage in. One way which can help us think through this biblically is to view political involvement through the lens of good works. First, we must ask what good works are. In John 6:28-29, Jesus is asked, ""What must we do, to be doing the works of God?"" He answers, ""This is the work of God, that you believe in him whom he has sent."" Therefore, as Martin Luther put it in his Treatise on Good Works, faith in Jesus Christ is ""the first and highest, the most precious of all good works.” Yet, as Christians, we also understand that genuine faith in Christ produces subsequent good works (James 2:14-26). The Apostle Paul, while emphasizing that that our salvations comes by grace alone through faith alone, nevertheless also tells us that we are “created in Christ Jesus for good works.” (Eph. 2:8-10) So, when we think of good works, we must not only think of our faith in Christ but also the works which proceeds from our faith. A helpful definition of good works is given in the The Heidelberg Catechism. Question 91 asks, ""But what are good works?"" It answers, ""Only those which proceed from a true faith, are performed according to the law of God and to his glory; and not such as are founded on our imaginations, or the institutions of men."" This definition rightly captures three essential elements of good works: that they proceed from our faith in Christ, uphold God’s law (what makes them ‘good’ works), and are done with the purpose of glorifying God, not ourselves. By upholding these 3 principles, we can avoid our works being guided by our own vain imaginations or being done in accordance with man’s rules and institutions as opposed to God’s. Can works done in the political sphere measure up to such a definition? I believe they can. Let’s look at each of the 3 principles laid out in the Heidelberg: 1. Proceeds from a true faith Can works in politics proceed from true faith? To answer this, we have to evaluate the nature of government itself. Romans 13 says that the governing authorities are ""instituted"" and ""appointed"" by God (vv.1-2), being called God's ""servant"" (v.4) and ""ministers of God"" (v.6). The reason God establishes government is to maintain moral order in society, to punish evil, and to promote good (Rom. 13:3-4; 1 Pet. 2:14). Even back in Genesis 9:6, we can see a prototype of government when God commands Noah, “Whoever sheds the blood of man, by man shall his blood be shed, for God made man in his own image.” God intended mankind, on some level, to use the power of the sword for good. Thus, the foundation and purpose of government are God-ordained, and therefore are good. There seems to be nothing in government’s nature that would intrinsically prevent Christians from being able to do works in the political sphere. 2. Performed according to the law of God Can works in the political arena be performed according to the law of God? It would seem that if government is given a God-ordained purpose, then it can be carried out in such a way that it pleases him. We are given examples in Scripture of righteous kings like David and Josiah, ministers in government who follow God’s law like Daniel and Nehemiah, and even godly citizens such as Paul. Of course, we must also recognize that Scripture and history are replete with governments and people who use the power of the sword unjustly and do not uphold the law of God. This does not negate the fact that the power of the sword can be used in accordance with God’s will. 3. Performed for God’s glory Can political works be done for God’s glory? If one has a heart after the Lord like David, and one’s actions coincide with God’s law, then the glorification of God would be a natural byproduct. However, with the nature of media today, it seems even more difficult to keep political leadership separated from self-aggrandizement. Yet, it is not intrinsic to political leadership any more than it is for a businessman to be greedy. Is the temptation always there? Yes. But can one still have a heart to glorify God and serve him faithfully in those capacities? Yes. The key to this endeavor, as in all things, is to saturate your heart in God’s Word and the fear of the Lord (Deut. 17:19-20; 2 Sam. 23:3-4). Because government has a God-ordained foundation and purpose, Christians are able to enter the political sphere with confidence that they can do good works in their various capacities, either as an elected or appointed official through governing or as a citizen through voting. Like other good works, Christians should seek to approach their political works through the lens of their faith as a Christian. By doing this, their political works will be motivated by the desire to uphold God's law with the result being God's glorification. Though many difficult theological and ethical questions will arise, who is better equipped than Christians full of God’s Spirit to help sort through our modern cultural and political context?

Food and Water Watch,https://www.foodandwaterwatch.org/insight/when-his-father-died-he-googled-teflon-and-cancer-and-found-out-about-pfas?ms=fwws_fp_02282019_michael-hickey-cancer-teflon-water-act&oms=fwws_fp_02282019_michael-hickey-cancer-teflon-water-act,"Ersel Hickey was a beloved husband, father, and grandfather known around his small town of Hoosick Falls, NY as a neighborly, kind man. Just months into his retirement, he was told he had cancer. This is the story of how his grieving son looked into where that cancer could have come from and found out way more about his town’s water than he bargained for.  Michael Hickey had a feeling something wasn’t right about the way his father died from kidney cancer. There was always idle speculation around town about how many people were always getting sick. It was the kind of thing that gets said but then shuffled aside in the hectic day-to-day routine. Often times, people don’t follow up on that kind of talk. But one day, Michael decided he had to do just that.  Since his father had worked for 35 years at the local plastics plant, which made Teflon-coated products, he Googled “Teflon and cancer.” Immediately, the results showed him scientific reports of a “probable link” between many types of cancer, including the kind his father had, and a substance called perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA). PFOA is a water and oil repellent. The scientific reporting was done as part of a DuPont settlement. Michael reached out to Dr. Marcus Martinez, a family physician to a large swath of the town’s residents. He too felt like an unusually high number of his patients were getting diagnosed with cancer. So they set out on a mission to discover what was going on. First, they asked the town’s part-time mayor to test the water supply. Since the EPA doesn’t require PFAS or PFOA testing, he declined. So Michael had his water tested at home from his kitchen tap, at his own expense. The results? 540 parts per trillion (ppt), well above the EPA’s non-enforceable recommendation of 400 ppt at the time — which has since been lowered to 70 ppt. That led officials from Hoosick Falls to finally test the town’s water, and the findings were consistent with Michael’s home results. The EPA administration in charge at the time then recommended that Hoosick Falls residents not cook with or drink water from their municipal wells. And Saint-Gobain Performance Plastics, the owner of the plastics plant in town, has footed the $2 million-plus bill for bottled water and a purification system at the town’s water treatment plant. Fast forward to today. This week Rep. Brenda Lawrence (MI) with Rep. Ro Khanna (CA) and Sen. Bernie Sanders (VT) are introducing new, improved WATER Act bills in the House and Senate that have provisions to help clean up the municipal water supplies affected by substances like PFOA and other PFAS. What may seem like a small addition to some people is a big deal to families in towns like Hoosick Falls, where the long-term effects of “revolutionary” manufactured products are only just now starting to become obvious. PFAS is the umbrella term for a variety of lab-made, fluorinated chemicals. As the EPA states, Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are a group of man-made chemicals that includes PFOA, PFOS, GenX, and many other chemicals. Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), a water and oil repellent, is just one of the many types of PFAS. Some PFAS, like PFOA, can be reduced significantly in water supplies through advanced methods. Others are resistant or actually become worse with treatment processes.From our recent report: According to the EPA’s Drinking Water Treatability database, PFOA and PFOS can be removed by up to 99 percent by processes such as granular activated carbon, membrane separation, ion exchange, and powdered activated carbon. Aside from these technologies, PFAS removal is resistant to many, if not most, water treatment processes, while other technologies may in fact increase their concentrations. Other processes, such as powdered activated carbon, are effective at removing older PFAS, but become less effective with newer PFAS, many of which are replacing the legacy PFAS. That’s why it’s important for the WATER Act to provide a method to fund treatment for towns that need it (where it will be effective) or to provide support for connecting to alternative water supplies when treatment will not be effective. We also need for PFAS to be stringently regulated in our drinking water. In addition to funding projects to address water contamination from per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), the new WATER Act will: Provide $35 billion a year to drinking water and wastewater improvements; Create up to nearly 1 million jobs across the economy and protect American workers; Prioritize disadvantaged communities with grants and additional support; Expand technical assistance to small, rural and indigenous communities; Dedicate and increase grants for indigenous communities; Help homeowners replace lead service lines; Provide more than $1 billion a year to update water infrastructure in public schools; Upgrade household wells and septic systems; and Promote safe, affordable, publicly controlled water for all.  This month marks the six-year anniversary since Michael Hickey and his family lost a beloved father and husband. Adding to Hoosick Falls’ tragedies, Dr. Martinez himself has since been diagnosed with an aggressive form of neuroendocrine cancer, and after a period of remission has learned that the cancer has returned and metastasized. To protect others from terrible, heartbreaking outcomes like these, we must act quickly. Our Executive Director, Wenonah Hauter, extols the many virtues of this new WATER Act: “The WATER Act is an important piece of the fair and just transition we must have to ensure resilience in the face of mounting climate chaos. It represents a commitment to clean water for all, now and into an uncertain future — and it will create nearly a million jobs in the process.” Michael Hickey is clear about what this new WATER Act would mean for a town and families like his: “Hoosick Falls is my home. It’s also a casualty of industrial pollution that’s left its toxic mark on my family and my neighbors’ families,” said Michael Hickey, a resident affected by per- and polyfluoroalkyl (PFAS) contamination in the area’s water. “The EPA is failing to do its job to protect us, so Congress must step up by supporting the WATER Act to ensure clean, safe and affordable water across the country. The provisions to provide grants to water systems affected by PFAS contamination will be a lifeline where EPA has miserably failed us.” We need concerned citizens like Food & Water Watch members and readers to show early support for this new WATER Act of 2019.

Food and Water Watch,https://www.foodandwaterwatch.org/news/fracking-endgame-its-literally-us-or-frackers,"With just a few years left to transition to 100 percent clean, renewable energy, the pressure is on to pivot away from fossil fuels as fast as we can. But if the frackers get their way, it’s game over for a stable climate. It’s them or us. Fracked gas production surged between 2000 and 2018, which pushed prices to their lowest levels in decades. Now frackers are in the midst of a gas glut and they cannot profit off of the excess cheap gas without new outlets to sop up the surplus supply. Persistently low prices have challenged the economic viability of the fracking industry’s continuous and steady expansion. So now, frackers are banking on polluting partnerships with three industrial players: the petrochemical and plastic industries that use natural gas liquids as feedstock for manufacturing; gas exporters building liquefied natural gas terminals to ship gas overseas; and the electric power industry, which is using fracked gas for unnecessary gas-fired power plants. These industries are throwing an economic lifeline to the fracking industry, and it’s all in service of creating new demand for what has been becoming a sinking investment.   Right now the basic economic problem for the fracking industry is that overproduction has created a gas glut that greatly outpaces domestic demand. By building infrastructure that relies on natural gas, frackers can keep drilling and cement us into a fossil-fueled future. But across the country activists and organizations like Food & Water Watch are becoming more successful at shutting down dirty infrastructure projects andgetting fracking banned. With theclimate change reportreleased in 2018 from the United Nations, it’s clear that cutting out the biggest contributors to carbon emissions is necessary to stave off the worst effects of climate change. We also know that the buildout of these proposed and planned facilities will have an effective lifespan far longer than the point when experts agree the world must shed all fossil fuels, meaning that these will be stranded assets and wasted economic investments. Instead of doubling down on these facilities, it would make more sense to invest in clean, renewable energy. That means frackers have to act fast and in a big way to cement their investment — they want to make sure they have their claws in us for as long as they can, and passing legislation to ban fracking becomes even more difficult when politicians and systems have signed off on new facilities and infrastructure that required billions of dollars in investment. It’s simple: frackers know that the people want out of this deadly power racket. So they’re hurrying to lock us in. At a time when we need to pivot away from fossil fuels, over 700 new facilities have been built, proposed, or are under development to capitalize off of an oversupply of cheap fracked gas. This shocking buildout is simultaneously fueling the construction of dangerous pipelines that connect shale fields to facilities. This buildout will lead to more plastics, liquefied natural gas exports, and gas-fired electricity that will increase air pollution, greenhouse gasses, and plastic waste. And government policies are propping up polluting partnerships by giving these industries new tax breaks and subsidies and lax permitting, while supporting continued fracked gas exploration and overproduction.  Power plants and facilities that convert natural gas into petrochemicals emit massive amounts of air and climate pollutants. Natural gas-fired power plants are major emitters of nitrogen oxides and contribute to ground-level ozone and smog. Likewise, petrochemical facilities release numerous pollutants and flaring leads to ozone formation. Prolonged contact with ground-level ozone from these facilities is linked to asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and studies have shown exposure to petrochemical facility pollutants is associated with heightened cancer risks, acute irritative symptoms and respiratory illnesses, especially for children. Industrial pollution, including emissions from chemical and plastics facilities as well as power plants, impacts the health of nearby communities that often lack resources to fight back. Often, these plants are disproportionately sited in communities of color and low-income areas, an issue of deep environmental injustice.  It is long past time to transition to a clean energy future, but the deep-pocketed fossil fuel, petrochemical and plastics industries are trying to derail this necessary transformation. Luckily, there is still time to change the outcome and thwart these plans. It’s going to require a massive movement among people like you and everyone you know, and organizations like Food & Water Watch. Will you take action right now by signing on to ban fracking?

Join millions of supporters by signing up for our newsletter.  The next Supreme Court justice will shape civil and constitutional rights jurisprudence in the country for decades to come. In nominating Brett Kavanaugh, Donald Trump has followed through on his threat to nominate a justice who would undermine basic rights and freedoms. His record is clear: Brett Kavanaugh poses a direct threat to LGBTQ equality, reproductive rights, affordable healthcare, immigrants’ rights, workers’ rights and so much more. Need further evidence? Just look at what some of our anti-equality opponents had to say about Trump’s Supreme Court nominee: Focus on the Family Jim Daly, president of the anti-LGBTQ organization Focus on the Family, praised Trump’s choice of Kavanaugh inan interview with the Washington Post, calling him a “top-drawer candidate.” Daly said that “the main reason Christian conservatives voted for President Trump was on the question of judges.” Family Research Council Anti-LGBTQ Family Research Council President Tony Perkinssaid that the organization looks forward to having someone with Kavanaugh's “philosophical approach” and that the organization is committed to helping “move the grassroots” to secure the nomination. Susan B. Anthony List Marjorie Dannenfelser, president of the anti-choice Susan B. Anthony List, called Kavanaugh's nomination “another outstanding choice” for Trump. The organization praised Trump for fulfilling his promise in nominating a judge with a record of condemning abortion access. National Right to Life Committee (NRLC) Carol Tobias, president of the anti-choiceNRLC, commended Trump for his nomination of the “exceptionally well qualified” justice to the Supreme Court. “All too often, democratically enacted laws to protect unborn children and other vulnerable humans have been overridden by judges who abuse their power to impose their own policy preferences,” said Tobias. Concerned Women for America “This is why conservative women voted overwhelmingly for Donald J. Trump,” saidPenny Nance, CEO of the conservative organization. According to Nance, Trump’s nominations of both Gorsuch and Kavanaugh are making good on his promises to affect the Supreme Court for generations. National Organization for Marriage (NOM) In proclaiming its support for Trump’s choice, the anti-LGBTQ organization promised to “work hard” to secure Kavanaugh’s nomination against a “brutal” confirmation process. Brian S. Brown, co-founder of NOM and infamous anti-LGBTQ leader, stated that he was “confident that (Kavanaugh) will join an opinion to overturn gay 'marriage' and restore traditional marriage to our nation's laws.” Breitbart Breitbart, a far-right news site associated with white nationalism, called Kavanaugh the “America First” choice. A story published on July 4 proclaimed that Kavanaugh applies “Trump’s economic patriotism” to the law, explaining how their views on immigration and labor align. National Rifle Association (NRA) The NRA lauded Trump’s nominationas an “outstanding” nominee. “He has an an impressive record that demonstrates his strong support for the Second Amendment,” said Chris W. Cox, NRA executive director. Cox promised that the NRA would activate its millions of members and supporters to ensure Kavanaugh’s confirmation.

Join millions of supporters by signing up for our newsletter.  “Queer” is a word with a complicated modern history – both used in a defiant chant originated by LGBTQ rights activists more than a quarter century ago to confront bigotry, and hijacked by hate-mongers doubling down on discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity. While we have been using the “Q” in much of our work for years, HRC has now officially embraced the word’s positive evolution, joining other advocates, supporters and new-generation activists who are taking back “queer” from those who still seek to use it as a slur. “We celebrate the journey of this word, and our movement, reclaiming with others what was once used as a cudgel against us, and recognizing the reality of how more and more LGBTQ people identify themselves,” said HRC President Chad Griffin. In HRC’s groundbreaking 2012 survey of self-identified LGBTQ youth, hundreds of respondents used “queer” to describe their sexual orientation or ""genderqueer"" to describe their gender identity, and many others wrote in their own descriptions of more fluid identities. The reality captured by the survey prompted HRC to begin using LGBTQ in its youth-related programs and work, including HRC Foundation’s annualTime to Thriveconference for teachers, counselors, social workers and other adults who work with LGBTQ youth. “Queer” serves as an umbrella term that encompasses many people as it intersects with sexual orientation and gender identity. It includes anyone who does not associate with heteronormativity, rather they have non-binary or gender expansive identities. Join millions of supporters by signing up for the HRC newsletter.

Begin Typing to SearchSubmit Search Washington, DC (May 22, 2019) –Al Gore and The Climate Reality Project will hold the next Climate Reality Leadership Corps training in Brisbane, Australia from June 5-7, 2019. Hosted in partnership with the Queensland Government, the training will coincide with Queensland’s first-everClimate Week QLD, a week of events to share ideas and inform the community about solutions to address the climate crisis. Climate Reality’s 41sttraining will explore the climate challenges and opportunities relevant to Queensland specifically and the Asia-Pacific region generally. Led by former US Vice President and Climate Reality Chairman Al Gore, the training will include appearances from elected officials, business leaders, communications experts and top scientists, who will give attendees the skills and knowledge to address the climate crisis and seek fair solutions with their communities. As part of the training, participants will also learn how to give the presentation made famous by the Oscar-winning filmAn Inconvenient Truthand seen in the 2017 follow-up filmAn Inconvenient Sequel: Truth to Power. “From dangerous heat waves and storms to the threatened loss of crop yields and the Great Barrier Reef, few places in the world have seen the impacts of the climate crisis more than Australia and the Asia-Pacific,” said Al Gore. “However, in the face of these impacts, Australia, New Zealand, and Pacific Island nations have a tremendous opportunity to champion solutions for a low-carbon, sustainable future, and have the tools needed to transition to a clean energy economy. These nations and their diverse coalitions fighting for a better future represent the hope that we can and will make the changes needed to solve the climate crisis.” In Australia and the Asia-Pacific region at large, climate impacts such as this year’s record-breaking heatwave in Australia, rising seas, droughts, floods, wildfires and increasingly uncertain seasons pose health and existential threats to citizens, especially indigenous communities. Increasing ocean temperatures and acidification jeopardise some of the world’s most biodiverse marine ecosystems, as well as the food, culture, and livelihoods of the 1 billion people who depend on it. In Queensland, the Great Barrier Reef alone is home to more than 1,500 species of fish and provides more than 64,000 jobs andAUD $6-7 billionto the local economy. Over three days, the training will include sessions on how citizens can influence decision makers, communicate with different audiences and implement ambitious climate action with their communities, particularly during this current review cycle leading up to the Paris Agreement’s implementation phase. States and cities across Australia and the region have an important role to play in addressing climate change. Though Queensland currently has the largest share of emissions from Australian states and territories, its government has set out to achieve a net-zero emissions economy by 2050 and a 50 percent renewable energy mix by 2030. The Australian states of New South Wales, Victoria, Tasmania, and South Australia have similar targets, while the cities of Brisbane, Sydney, Melbourne, and Adelaide have also adopted ambitious climate policies that reflect the urgent need for action. Meanwhile, significant investments in solar and wind across Australia and New Zealand are creating good jobs and providing affordable, clean power for high-emissions industries and communities historically reliant on fossil fuels. Climate Reality has trained more than 19,000 leaders from 152 countries. Following the Brisbane training, the next training will take place in Minneapolis-St. Paul, Minnesota. Recent trainings have included Atlanta, Georgia; Los Angeles, California; Berlin, Germany; Mexico City, Mexico; Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania; Greater Seattle, Washington; Denver, Colorado; Shenzhen, China; Manila, Philippines; Miami, Florida; Toronto, Canada; New Delhi, India; and Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Climate Reality also has 10 global branch offices and approximately 130 local chapters throughout the United States.

Pleaseenable javascriptfor the optimal experience! Begin Typing to SearchSubmit Search OLYMPIA, WASH. – On May 7, 2019, Governor Jay Inslee signed into lawSenate Bill5116,which mandates that the state gets 100 percent of its electricity from clean sources by 2045. The passage positions Washington as a national leader in the transition to a clean, affordable, and reliable energy future. Washington state’s announcement comes at a time when both the reality of the climate crisis and the practical steps to solve it have never been clearer. Eighteen of the 19 hottest years on record have occurred since the beginning of this century, and alongside these increases in global temperatures, weather events like major hurricanes, floods, and droughts have become more frequent and severe. But with clean energy and energy storage becoming more affordable and widely available, we have the solutions today to solve this crisis. The Climate Reality Project’s Washington state chapters in Bellingham, Snohomish County, Seattle, Tacoma, and Thurston County, as well as Climate Reality Leaders in other parts of the state, joined forces as the Washington State Coalition, under the guidance of the Environmental Priorities Coalition. The coalition worked to get the state legislature to commit to transition to a safer, more sustainable energy future for the Evergreen State. Climate Reality Leaders and chapter members were instrumental in the passage of the bill. They assisted in sending 415 emails to state senators in support of the legislation, and hosted more than 10 meetings with representatives from Everett, Mukilteo, Seattle, Bellevue, Redmond and Kirkland, Olympia, and the Snohomish County Public Utilities Department (PUD). Their collective efforts also prompted 10 businesses to sign on in support of the statewide initiative. “Today was a momentous occasion for all Washingtonians with the passing of SB 5116,” said Ali Lee, co-chair of The Climate Reality Project: Seattle, WA Chapter and the100% CommittedWA state campaign chair. “We rallied chapters and Climate Reality Leaders across the state to make calls, publish articles, and meet with legislators to help pass this bill. Thank you all for this truly statewide effort, working together as Climate Reality Leaders in coalition with other like-minded organizations for 100 percent clean electricity.” The bill phases out coal from the electricity grid by the end of 2025 and makes swift progress toward cutting further carbon pollution by setting an interim target of carbon-neutral electricity by 2030. SB 5116 invests in low-income communities to correct historic energy inequities through a cumulative impact analysis in the development of clean energy action plans, and funding made available for energy assistance to low-income households. The bill also invests in Washington workers as part of the transition to clean electricity, prioritizing jobs with livable wages. The passage of the bill positions Washington state as a national leader in the transition to clean electricity with a dedicated focus on correcting historic climate injustices and lifting up the vulnerable communities often most affected by the climate crisis.
